Commercial Entertainment Cinema</field><field name="creator">Brown, James</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the historically composed political and economic contexts that contributed to the late 1990s commercial renaissance of Korean national cinema and that have sustained the popularity of Korean films among local and regional audiences ever since. Unlike existing approaches to the topic, which emphasise the textual characteristics of national film production, this thesis considers relations between film production, distribution, exhibition, and ancillary markets, as well as Korean cinema&#146;s engagement with international cinemas such as Hollywood, Hong Kong, China and Japan. I argue that following the relaxation of restrictive film policy towards the importation and distribution of foreign films between 1986 and 1988, the subsequent failure of the domestic film industry to compete against international competition precipitated a remarkable shift in consensus regarding the industry&#146;s structure and functions. Due to the loss of distribution rights to foreign films and the rapid decline in ticket sales for Korean films, the continued economic viability of local film companies was under enormous threat by the early 1990s. The government reacted by permitting conglomerates to seize control of the industry and pursue vertical and horizontal integration. During the rest of the decade, Korean cinema was transformed from an art cinema to a commercial entertainment cinema. The 1997/98 economic crisis led to the exit of conglomerate finance, but streamlined film companies were able to withstand the monetary meltdown, continue the domestic revitalisation, and, since the late 1990s, build media empires based on the expansion of Korean cinema throughout the Asian region.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motion picture</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">korea</field><field name="subject">south korea</field><field name="subject">film production</field><field name="subject">film distribution</field><field name="subject">film exhibition</field><field name="subject">screen quota</field><field name="subject">korean new wave</field><field name="subject">new korean cinema</field><field name="subject">multiplex</field><field name="subject">CJ Entertainment</field><field name="subject">Cinema Service</field><field name="subject">Mediaplex</field><field name="subject">Lotte Cinema</field><field name="subject">regionalisation</field><field name="subject">venture capital</field><field name="subject">home video</field><field name="subject">cable television</field><field name="subject">pay television</field><field name="subject">chaebol</field><field name="subject">vertical integration</field><field name="subject">economic crisis</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20071122.143238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STORE OPERATED Ca2+ CHANNELS IN LIVER CELLS: REGULATION BY BILE ACIDS AND A SUB-REGION OF THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM</field><field name="creator">Castro Kraftchenko, Joel</field><field name="description">Cholestasis is an important liver pathology. During cholestasis bile acids accumulate in the bile canaliculus affecting hepatocyte viability. The actions of bile acids require changes in the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and in Ca2+ entry. The target(s) of the Ca2+ entry pathway affected by bile acids is, however, not known. The overall objective of the work described in this thesis was to elucidate the target(s) and mechanism(s) of bile acids-induced modulation of hepatocytes calcium homeostasis.
First, it was shown that a 12 h pre-incubation with cholestatic bile acids (to mimic cholestasis conditions) induced the inhibition of Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs), while the addition of choleretic bile acids to the incubation medium caused the reversible activation of Ca2+ entry through SOCs. Moreover, it was shown that incubation of liver cells with choleretic bile acids counteracts the inhibition of Ca2+ entry caused by pre-incubation with cholestatic bile acids. Thus, it was concluded that SOCs are the target of bile acids action in liver cells.
Surprisingly, despite the effect of choleretic bile acids in activating SOCs, the Ca2+ dye fura-2 failed to detect choleretic bile acid-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. However, under the same conditions, when the sub-plasma membrane Ca2+ levels were measured using FFP-18 Ca2+ dye, choleretic bile acid induced a transient increase in FFP-18 fluorescence. This evidence suggested that choleretic bile acids-induced activation of Ca2+ entry through SOCs, involving the release of Ca2+ from a region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) located in the vicinity of the plasma membrane.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liver cells</field><field name="subject">Store Operated Calcium Channels</field><field name="subject">Bile Acids</field><field name="subject">Endoplasmic Reticulum</field><field name="subject">STIM1</field><field name="subject">Orai1</field><field name="subject">TRPV1</field><field name="subject">Fura-2</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080826.135311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young People and Politics: Apathetic and Disengaged? A Qualitative Inquiry</field><field name="creator">Manning, Nathan Paul</field><field name="description">This thesis is an examination of the prominent discourse which claims young people are apathetic and disengaged from politics. It is argued that this discourse is based upon two faulty conceptual assumptions, firstly, that youth is a period of linear transition to adulthood, and secondly, that the discourse unreflexively applies an unproblematised notion of politics which has its origin in the eighteenth century Scottish Enlightenment. The research used in-depth qualitative interviews to explore the ways in which young people operating across the political spectrum understand and practice politics. These qualitative findings add to existing studies of young people and politics, which are predominantly quantitative in approach. The findings suggest that the Scottish Enlightenment&#146;s narrow, regulatory, liberal model of politics is the hegemonic model of politics for participants. However, this hegemony is challenged by participants&#146; own &#145;political&#146; practices, the collapse of liberalism&#146;s public/private divide under conditions of late modernity, and an interconnected sense of self. Moreover, contrary to the discourse of apathetic and disengaged youth, that there are a number of ways of understanding and practicing politics, particularly in light of social processes &#150; such as individualisation, new social movements, and consumerism &#150; driving recent social change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Young People</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">Qualitative Research</field><field name="subject">Young People and Politics</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070903.180304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Synthesis and Characterisation of Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane Bound Chromophores</field><field name="creator">Clarke, David John</field><field name="description">This research involved the synthesis and characterisation of a range of optically active polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) compounds.
POSS precursor compounds containing functional groups required for subsequent attachment of the desired functional groups have been synthesised. Examples of such precursor compounds include mono-functionalised POSS compounds with periphery aldehyde, azide, amino and pyridyl functional groups.
A variety of POSS compounds, functionalised with a range of optical functionalities, including optical limiters such as fulleropyrrolidine and iminofullerene, and dyes and pigments, including naphthalene, biphenyl, perylene, pyrene and porphyrin have been synthesised.
The reaction of mono-functionalised POSS aldehydes with fullerene (C60) in the presence of N-methylglycine yielded the desired POSS fulleropyrrolidines, whilst reaction of mono-functionalised POSS azide with C60 yielded POSS iminofullerenes. All POSS fullerene compounds were characterised by power limiting measurements, exhibiting comparable power limiting to that of parent C60.
The microwave condensation of mono-amino POSS with a range of mono- and bis-anhydrides yielded the POSS imide compounds, which were characterised by UV-Vis and fluorescence spectrophotometry. The perylene POSS imide derivative was further characterised by single crystal x-ray crystallography. The naphtha and biphenyl POSS imides exhibited extremely weak fluorescence, whilst the perylene
ii
POSS imide displayed particularly strong fluorescence, with a quantum yield approaching unity.
The incorporation of a pyridyl group on the periphery of a mono-functionalised POSS cage allowed for the synthesis of the first porphyrin functionalised POSS compound. Mono-porphyrin POSS exhibited comparable absorption properties to other pyridyl ligated ruthenium porphyrins.
Mono-functionalised pyrene POSS compounds were prepared through the reaction of 1-pyrene acid chloride with mono(3-aminopropyl)POSS. This synthetic pathway offered a convenient route to mono-functionalised pyrene POSS, in preference to the multi-substitution associated with Heck coupling. Mono-pyrene POSS was determined to be strongly fluorescent, exhibiting a high quantum yield of fluorescence</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silsesquioxane</field><field name="subject">POSS</field><field name="subject">fullerene</field><field name="subject">fulleropyrrolidine</field><field name="subject">iminofullerene</field><field name="subject">pyrene</field><field name="subject">perylene</field><field name="subject">porphyrin</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080908.074728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of approaches to disability and rehabilitation, in the context of Somali refugees in Kenya</field><field name="creator">Abdi, Siyat Hillow</field><field name="description">There is international concern over the refugee increase in many parts of the world and the international community is bearing the responsibility of assisting refugees with relief, rehabilitation, integration and possible repatriation programs. This has created unprecedented challenges for the international community since the amount of assistance has had to increase and resources have had to be diverted from development programs in countries with serious economic and social problems.
The current study addressed important issues related to refugees with disabilities living in the Dadaab Refugee Camp Complexes in Kenya. After a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of the major study, 200 individuals with a disability were interviewed, and focus group discussions were held with individuals and groups supporting people with disabilities. 
The study was guided by the following research objectives:
1.	To determine the prevalence of disability among Somali refugees and clarify the concept of disability as it relates to the Somali community;
2.	To identify and discuss the nature and the causes of disability among the Somali refugees in Kenya;
3.	To gain a picture of the basic needs, aspirations, and challenges of Somali refugees with a disability;
4.	To examine and evaluate the prevailing educational and rehabilitation approaches to disability in the context of Somali refugees in Kenya; and
5.	To develop a framework for a comprehensive approach to community rehabilitation relevant to refugees with a disability in Kenya.
The research found that, while war in Somalia and related factors have contributed significantly to disability amongst members of the Somali community, cultural mindsets perpetuate disability and undermine the existing efforts to alleviate the conditions that people experience. Education and rehabilitation, which would be viable means of addressing the issues associated with disability, are inadequate in the refugee camps. The study acknowledges the efforts made by international agencies to help and support people with disabilities. However, it notes that more needs to be done if the Somali refugees with disability are to live dignified and functional human lives.
This study draws the following conclusions:
&#149;	Although war in Somalia is, reportedly, the main actual cause of disability among the Somali refugees in the Dadaab camps in Kenya, culturally, curses are considered to have led to disabilities by major sections of the Somali community.
&#149;	The concept of disability as culturally and socially constructed is inadequate. Consequently, in order to address disability effectively, these cultural constructions need to be carefully evaluated and transformed.
&#149;	The current efforts aimed at assisting refugees with disability are commendable but there is a need to improve the educational and rehabilitation approaches used to provide services to refugees with disability. The community rehabilitation approach would seem to offer the best opportunities for assisting to engage and support the empowerment and acceptance of refugees with disabilities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">refugees</field><field name="subject">Somalia</field><field name="subject">Kenya</field><field name="subject">Dadaab Camps</field><field name="subject">Community Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080904.150115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Housing for people 
with a psychiatric disability;
community empowerment, 
partnerships and politics</field><field name="creator">Battams, Samantha Jane</field><field name="description">This research examined intersectoral relationships and community participation in policy processes across the mental health and housing sectors. The focus was on the development of suitable housing options for people with a psychiatric disability.  The study period covered five years of mental health system reform in South Australia (2000-2005). The research found a shortage of housing and support options for people with psychiatric disability and lack of significant strategic policy coordination or ongoing cross-sectoral programmes. The problems faced by people in gaining access to housing and disability support services and the ways in which families provide housing or support in the absence of public services are documented.
This case study used qualitative research methods which were triangulated across four stages: 1) a thematic analysis of national and state policies in the health, housing and disability sectors; 2) participant observation of NGO activity, a thematic analysis of NGO documents, and interviews and focus groups with NGOs; 3) interviews and focus groups with consumer and carer representatives and a thematic analysis of the minutes from state-level groups; 4) interviews with professionals from the health, housing and disability sectors 
The housing situation for people with psychiatric disability was explained in terms of a number of key issues in the policy environment;
&#132;X	The overarching neo-liberal policy context synonymous with a decline in public housing resources and increasing tension between NGOs service provider and advocacy roles.
&#132;X	The political nature of the local mental health policy context and lack of political commitment to ongoing resources. Broad community stigma reflected in the media and government, affecting ongoing political commitment to mental health and housing and the introduction and progress of housing &#161;&#165;projects&#161;&#166;.
&#132;X	The slow development of peak NGO and consumer organisations and alliances in South Australia which affected access to policy networks and contributed to the dominance of professional interests within policy processes. 
&#132;X	The separation of health, housing and disability policy and networks within and across levels of government. This was associated with bilateral agreements (between Australian and state governments) tied to resources within departments, the programme objectives and the goals of bureaucrats. 
&#132;X	The separation of policy networks by sector was also connected to the dominance of bio-medical discourses and interventions and associated professional interests in the health policy sector. Medical discourses on health and disability and &#161;&#165;consumerist&#161;&#166; discourses on participation also led to social determinants of health such as housing being overlooked within policy processes.
&#132;X	Governance reform at a state level contributed to organisational instability within departments, causing some problems for cross-sectoral initiatives and protocols.
Kingdon&#161;&#166;s (2003) multiple streams analysis of policy helped to explain what missed or reached political agendas within each policy sector of the case study. Kingdon predicts that the unity of policy networks is important for the realization of policy solutions, and the lack of unity in policy sectors was an obstacle to policy agendas on housing for people with a psychiatric disability. However, the way in which problems were being represented (Bacchi 1999) was also important to understanding this policy environment. For example, a medical discourse on disability (Fulcher 1989) tied to the health sector led to a narrow focus on clinical mental health services. Similarly, neo-liberal discourse (Dean 1999) supported private housing solutions and resources or NGOs advocating &#161;&#165;within sectors&#161;&#166; for the types of services they already provided or wished to provide.
The case study suggested strategies for &#161;&#165;policy change&#161;&#166; need to address a number of factors across service delivery, policy and political realms. Firstly, better recognition is warranted of the difficulty experienced by many people with psychiatric disability in achieving stable housing, and the need for indicators on housing access and stability for this group. Secondly, processes to address stigma (particularly that perpetuated in the media) will be instrumental for policy change and political commitment. Thirdly, ongoing cross sectoral advocacy and alliances require development at both a national and state level and support by a political culture which encourages advocacy. Developing processes for working across sectors such as policy learning forums involving both experts and community groups could counter problems arising from professional culture and territories that were documented in this study. Finally, the cross-sectoral development of policy, programmes and accountability mechanisms and the stability of policy networks will be important to ensuring stable housing for people with psychiatric disability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental health policy</field><field name="subject">psychiatric disability</field><field name="subject">mental illness</field><field name="subject">intersectoral policy</field><field name="subject">intersectoral collaboration</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">supported housing</field><field name="subject">housing policy</field><field name="subject">homelessness</field><field name="subject">community empowerment</field><field name="subject">community participation in health</field><field name="subject">deinstitutionalisation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080926.215213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil mechanical properties and the behaviour of roots in structured soil : published works</field><field name="creator">Dexter, Anthony Roger.</field><field name="description">Comprised of the author's previously published works.

The distribution of soil organic C (SOC) largely follows gradients similar to biomass accumulation, increasing with increasing precipitation and decreasing temperature. As a result, SOC levels are a function of inputs, dominated by plant litter contributions and rhizodeposition, and losses such as leaching, erosion and heterotrophic respiration. Therefore, changes in biomass inputs, or organic matter accumulation, will most likely also alter these levels in soils. Although the soil microbial biomass (SMB) only comprises 1-5% of soil organic matter (SOM), it is critical in organic matter decomposition and can provide an early indicator of SOM dynamics as a whole due to its faster turnover time, and hence, can be used to determine soil C dynamics under changing environmental conditions.&#182;

Approximately 932 million ha of land worldwide are degraded due to salinity and sodicity, usually coinciding with land available for agriculture, with salinity affecting 23% of arable land while saline-sodic soils affect a further 10%. Soils affected by salinity, that is, those soils high in soluble salts, are characterised by rising watertables and waterlogging of lower-lying areas in the landscape. Sodic soils are high in exchangeable sodium, and slake and disperse upon wetting to form massive hardsetting structures. Upon drying, sodic soils suffer from poor soil-water relations largely related to decreased permeability, low infiltration capacity and the formation of surface crusts. In these degraded areas, SOC levels are likely to be affected by declining vegetation health and hence, decreasing biomass inputs and concomitant lower levels of organic matter accumulation. Moreover, potential SOC losses can also be affected from dispersed aggregates due to sodicity and solubilisation of SOM due to salinity. However, few studies are available that unambiguously demonstrate the effect of increasing salinity and sodicity on C dynamics. This thesis describes a range of laboratory and field investigations on the effects of salinity and sodicity on SOC dynamics.&#182;

In this research, the effects of a range of salinity and sodicity levels on C dynamics were determined by subjecting a vegetated soil from Bevendale, New South Wales (NSW) to one of six treatments. A low, mid or high salinity solution (EC 0.5, 10 or 30 dS/m) combined with a low or high sodicity solution (SAR 1 or 30) in a factorial design was leached through a non-degraded soil in a controlled environment. Soil respiration and the SMB were measured over a 12-week experimental period. The greatest increases in SMB occurred in treatments of high-salinity high-sodicity, and high-salinity low-sodicity. This was attributed to solubilisation of SOM which provided additional substrate for decomposition for the microbial population. Thus, 
as salinity and sodicity increase in the field, soil C is likely to be rapidly lost as a result of increased mineralisation.&#182;
 
Gypsum is the most commonly-used ameliorant in the rehabilitation of sodic and saline-sodic soils affected by adverse soil environmental conditions. When soils were sampled from two sodic profiles in salt-scalded areas at Bevendale and Young, SMB levels and soil respiration rates measured in the laboratory were found to be low in the sodic soil compared to normal non-degraded soils. When the sodic soils were treated with gypsum, there was no change in the SMB and respiration rates. The low levels of SMB and respiration rates were due to low SOC levels as a result of little or no C input into the soils of these highly degraded landscapes, as the high salinity and high sodicity levels have resulted in vegetation death. However, following the addition of organic material to the scalded soils, in the form of coarsely-ground kangaroo grass, SMB levels and respiration rates increased to levels greater than those found in the non-degraded soil. The addition of gypsum (with organic material) gave no additional increases in the SMB.&#182;

The level of SOC stocks in salt-scalded, vegetated and revegetated profiles was also determined, so that the amount of SOC lost due to salinisation and sodication, and the increase in SOC following revegetation relative to the amount of SOC in a vegetated profile could be ascertained. Results showed up to three times less SOC in salt-scalded profiles compared to vegetated profiles under native pasture, while revegetation of formerly scalded areas with introduced pasture displayed SOC levels comparable to those under native pasture to a depth of 30 cm. However, SOC stocks can be underestimated in saline and sodic landscapes by setting the lower boundary at 30 cm due to the presence of waterlogging, which commonly occurs at a depth greater than 30 cm in saline and sodic landscapes as a result of the presence of high or perched watertables. These results indicate that successful revegetation of scalded areas has the potential to accumulate SOC stocks similar to those found prior to degradation.&#182; 

The experimental results from this project indicate that in salt-affected landscapes, initial increases in salinity and sodicity result in rapid C mineralisation. Biomass inputs also decrease due to declining vegetation health, followed by further losses as a result of leaching and erosion. The remaining native SOM is then mineralised, until very low SOC stocks remain. However, the C sequestration potential in these degraded areas is high, particularly if rehabilitation efforts are successful in reducing salinity and sodicity. Soil ecosystem functions can then be restored if organic material is available as C stock and for decomposition in the form of either added organic material or inputs from vegetation when these salt-affected landscapes are revegetated.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">sodicity</field><field name="subject">soil carbon</field><field name="subject">soil microbial biomass</field><field name="subject">soil respiration</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080428.223144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fiddler crab claw-waving display: an analysis of the structure and function of a movement-based visual signal</field><field name="creator">How, Martin John</field><field name="description">Communication is an essential component of animal social systems and a diverse suite of signals can be found in the natural environment. An area of animal communication that, for technical reasons, we know very little about is the field of &#145;movement-based&#146; or &#145;dynamic&#146; visual signals. In this thesis, I make use of recent advances in measurement and analysis techniques, including digital video and image motion processing tools, to improve our understanding of how movement-based signals are adjusted according to signalling context. I measured and characterised the flamboyant claw-waving displays of male fiddler crabs (Genus Uca) and made use of their transparent lifestyle to record the behavioural contexts in which these signals are produced.&#182;  
The claw-waving displays of seven Australian species of fiddler crab are compared and contrasted to show that these signals are species-specific, but also vary within and between individuals. I show that the species Uca perplexa produces different types of signal in different behavioural contexts, a lateral wave for courtship, and a vertical wave during short-range agonistic and courtship interactions. The structure of the lateral courtship waves of Uca perplexa vary according to the distance of signal receivers, the first time this kind of relationship has been shown in a dynamic visual signal. Finally, I describe and analyse the signalling and orientation behaviour of U. elegans during courtship herding, an unusual mating system that uses the claw-waving display in a novel way.&#182;
The adjustments made by fiddler crabs to their displays during changes in behavioural contexts suggest that the fine-scale context-sensitivity of animal signals may be far more widespread in communication than hitherto recognised.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fiddler crab</field><field name="subject">visual ecology</field><field name="subject">dynamic visual signal</field><field name="subject">movement-based signal</field><field name="subject">animal communication</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20081001.111333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions to the molecular genetics of the Narrow-leaf Lupin (Lupinus augustifolius L.) : mapping, marker development and QTL analysis</field><field name="creator">Boersma, Jeffrey George</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Narrow-leaf lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) was first recorded as having been introduced into Germany during the mid-19th century for use as green manuring and as fodder crops. However, it was not until post World-War I that there was any serious attempt to domesticate the species. Since that time several key domestication genes have been incorporated to enable the species to be grown as a crop over a range of climates, harvested as a bulk commodity and, the seed used for both animal and human consumption. However, the recent domestication of this species has seen a rather limited use of wild germplasm  largely as a result of the difficulty in retaining these key domestication genes. To make the task of retaining these genes manageable, it was decided to resort to molecular technology. A mapping population of F8 derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs) has previously been established by the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia, from a cross between a domesticated breeding line 83A:476 and a wild type P27255 in narrow-leaf lupin. The parents together with 89 RILs (of a population of 115) were subjected to DNA fingerprinting using microsatelliteanchored fragment length polymorphism (MFLP) to rapidly generate DNA markers for construction of a linkage map. Five hundred and twenty two unique markers of which 21% were co-dominant, were generated and mapped. Phenotypic data for the domestication traits: mollis (soft seeds), leucospermus (white flower and seed colour); Lentus (reduced pod-shattering), iucundis (low alkaloid), Ku (early flowering) and moustache pattern on seed coats; were included. Three to 7 molecular markers were identified within 5 cM of each of these domestication genes. The anthracnose resistance gene Lanr1 was also mapped. Linkage groups were constructed using MapManager version QTXb20, resulting in 21 linkage groups consisting of 8 or more markers. ... Five pairs of QTLs were found to be involved in epistasis, 2 of these having an effect on early vigour and another 3 influencing the time to opening of the first florets. Variation explained for each trait ranged from 28% for seed size, to 88% for days to flowering. We showed that it was possible to use this data to predict genotypes of superior progeny for these traits under Mediterranean conditions. QTL regions were compared on a second published linkage map and regions of conserved synteny with the model legume Medicago truncatula high-lighted. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates the importance of tight linkage between markers and genes of interest. It is especially important when dealing with genetically diverse material as found in the wild. One of the main problems faced by molecular scientists is the phenomenon known as linkage disequilibrium in marker populations caused by either small population size or 4 insufficient opportunity for recombination. This frequently results in the development of markers with little or no application outside of the population in which it was developed. Although the relatively small size of the population used in this study exposes it to such constraints, in this case excellent and valuable results were achieved in developing useful markers to at least 3 of the domestication traits within a relatively short time period of less then 4 years.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lupinus angustifolius -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Lupines -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Gene mapping</field><field name="subject">Genetic markers</field><field name="subject">Narrow-leaf lupins</field><field name="subject">Genetic mapping</field><field name="subject">Molecular markers</field><field name="subject">Quantitative traits</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the effects of risk and uncertainty on consumers' decision-making processes : a cross-national study</field><field name="creator">Quintal, Vanessa Ann</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Global tourism accounted for US$623 billion in 2004, representing 6% of the world's exports of goods and services (World Tourism Organisation, 2005). In the last decade, natural and man-made disasters have adversely affected the tourism industry. Consequently, the risk and uncertainty associated with travel have increased, potentially impacting on tourists' behaviour. However, while travel motivators have received a great deal of research attention, travel constraints have not been examined to the same degree. The present study explores risk and uncertainty and their roles in people's decisionmaking processes in a tourism context. In doing so, attempts were made to clarify the distinction between the risk and uncertainty constructs, which in prior research often have been used interchangeably, leading to some confusion about their roles. The distinction between the perceptual and attitudinal constructs also was clarified, as prior research into their differential impacts has been limited. To achieve these objectives, data were collected from online research panel members in Australia, the United States (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), New Zealand, South Korea, China and Japan, as part of a larger tourism study.

It analyses data collected from managers and facilitators to identify the critical contingency factors that influence the use of group facilitation. The data was analysed using an iterative process of grounded content analysis. The findings identify four primary contingency factors that influence the use of group facilitation. Chief among these is the 'outcomes-oriented' worldview that characterises the theories-in-use of both managers and facilitators. Group facilitation is used when managers perceive that it is likely to be an appropriate intervention which will enable the achievement of certain desired organisational goals. A parallel finding is that the relationship between managers and external facilitators is frequently 'instrumental' in nature. These findings have significant implications for both the theory and practice of group facilitation, especially concerning the field's dominant view of facilitation as a 'neutral' intervention. It extends the perspective proffered by a minority of scholars and writers in this field. The other primary contingency factors identified in this study include the complexity of the group's task; the need to challenge or otherwise alter the way a group is thinking in relation to its task; and the need to have open discussions about issues pertaining to the work or life of the group when the expertise to enable such discussions is not otherwise available. In addition to the implications regarding the neutrality of facilitation, the findings of this study have implications for the management of groups within organisations. Facilitation is demonstrably a useful means of building trust and enhancing relationships in numerous situations. It is also clearly perceived to be an appropriate means of enabling groups to structure and manage complex tasks. This includes tasks that are both objectively complex in nature, and those that group members subjectively experience as complex tasks. Given the increasing complexity of business environments, the complexity of many group tasks, and the increasing propensity for organisations to utilise teams and groups to get work done, facilitation is emerging as an important means of assisting organisational effectiveness.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Group facilitation</field><field name="subject">Teams in the workplace</field><field name="subject">Interactive management</field><field name="subject">Group problem solving</field><field name="subject">Group Decision Making</field><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Organisations</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour and analysis of embedded cantilever wall on a slope</field><field name="creator">Ong, Chin Chai</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The feasibility of using interlocked light gauge sheet piles to form a deep cross-sectional wall embedded in a residual slope or with a berm support is explored. This thesis compares the performance of a large section modulus sheet pile wall as an alternative to a concrete diaphragm wall, acting as an embedded cantilever wall on a slope (ECWS) by means of experimental centrifuge tests, numerical models and analytical methods. Abaqus (Hibbitt, Karlsson and Sorensen Inc, 1997) was used to conduct extensive numerical trials on the structural performance of the sheet pile wall model prior to the actual physical testing. The Abaqus results showed that the integrity of the interlock and reduced modulus action (RMA) due to slippage along the interlocked joint did not cause premature buckling of the thin wall even at the ultimate load. Further, a comparative study using centrifuge tests on 1:30 scaled models and Plaxis analysis demonstrated that under the worst condition with high water table, the rigid sheet pile wall of 1.32 m cross-sectional width carried a higher ultimate surcharge load with a much lower top of wall deflection, compared to a more flexible 0.6 m thick cracked concrete diaphragm wall. The analysis of the wall/soil/slope interactions for an ECWS involves many inter-dependent variables in addition to the complications of considering an adjacent slope or a berm support. It is difficult for existing analytical approaches to take all these factors into account, and some form of numerical analysis, calibrated through field data and results from centrifuge model tests is necessary. From the observations of the centrifuge tests and finite element analysis, major assumptions about the failure of a stiff ECWS in a rotational mode were deduced and adopted in the proposed limiting equilibrium method (Leq). The plane strain Leq ECWS Abstract ii analysis is based on the framework of minimum upper bound limiting equilibrium with planar failure planes and a Mohr-Coulomb soil model. As compared to the traditional limit equilibrium analysis, the Leq method is a fully coupled analysis using the shear strength reduction technique (SSR). New formulations are proposed for the development of horizontal active and passive pressure distributions based on the experimental and FE models. The proposed active pressure profile used is derived by combining the Coulomb and Krey method, and empirically back-figured to curve-fit the centrifuge tests by Morris (2005). The proposed passive pressure profile of a rigid rotational wall in failure is adjusted to allow for an adjacent slope or berm support through a presumed elasto-plastic deformation instead of a linear rigid translation of the passive wedge. ... A parametric study was later undertaken using the Leq method to develop a series of non-dimensionalised graphs to study and draw summarised conclusions on the behaviour of the ECWS. The final conclusions on the comparative study of the centrifuge tests, Plaxis and Leq analyses demonstrated that the alternative light gauge steel sheet pile performed very well as an ECWS. A key factor in the performance of the sheet pile wall was attributed to the large 1.32 m cross-sectional width of the interlocked sections. This provided high bending stiffness and high moment stability from shear stresses acting on the back and front faces of the wall.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retaining walls</field><field name="subject">Slopes (Soil mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Centrifugation</field><field name="subject">Embedded cantilever wall</field><field name="subject">Limit equilibrium</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and RNA-binding of poly (C) protein 1</field><field name="creator">Sidiqi, Mahjooba</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Regulation of mRNA stability is an important posttranscriptional mechanism involved in the control of gene expression. The rate of mRNA decay can differ greatly from one mRNA to another and may be regulated by RNA-protein interactions. A key determinant of mRNA decay are sequence instability (cis) elements often located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of many mRNAs. For example, the AU rich elements (AREs), are such well characterized elements, and most commonly involved in promoting mRNA degradation, and specific binding of proteins to these elements leading to the stabilization of some mRNAs. Other cis-elements have been described for mRNA in which mRNA stability is a critical component of gene regulation. This includes the androgen receptor (AR) UC-rich cis element in its 3'UTR. The AR is a key target for therapeutics in human prostate cancer and thus understanding the mechanism involved in regulating its expression is an important goal. The [alpha]CP1 protein, a KH-domain containing RNA-binding protein has been found to bind this UC-rich region of the AR and is thought to play an important role in regulating AR mRNA expression. [alpha]CP1 protein is a triple KH (hnRNP K homology) domain protein with specificity for Crich tracts of RNA and ssDNA (single stranded DNA). Relatively little is known about the structural interaction of [alpha]CP1 with target RNA cis elements, thus the present study aimed to better understand the nature of interaction between 30 nt 3'UTR UC-rich AR mRNA and [alpha]CP1 protein using various biophysical techniques, in an attempt to determine which [alpha]CP1 domain or combination of domains is involved in RNA-binding. These studies could ultimately provide novel targets for drugs aimed to regulate AR mRNA expression in prostate cancer cells. At the commencement of this study little was known about the structure of the [alpha]CP1- KH domains and their basis for poly (C) binding specificity. ... Additional studies addressed the significance of the four core recognition nucleotides (TCCC) using a series of cytosine to thymine mutants. The findings verified some of the results predicted from structural studies, especially the need for maximum KH binding to a core tetranucleotide recognition sequence. Our mutational studies of the four core bases confirmed the importance of cytosine in positions two and three as no binding was observed, while some binding was observed when the fourth base was mutated. In summary, the work presented in this thesis provides new detailed insight into the molecular interactions between the [alpha]CP1-KH domain and AR mRNA. Furthermore, these studies shed light on the nature of protein/mRNA interactions in general, as well as the specific complex that forms on AR mRNA. These studies have provided new understanding into the mode of [alpha]CP1 binding at a target oligonucleotide binding site and, provide a foundation for future studies to define structure of multiprotein/oligonucleotide complexes involved in AR mRNA gene regulation. Understanding the detailed interaction between the AR mRNA and [alpha]CP1 could provide possible targets for drug development at reducing AR expression in prostate cancer cells by interfering with the interaction of [alpha]CP1 and AR-mRNA.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RNA-protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Protein binding -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">xCPI-KHI</field><field name="subject">RNA-binding protein</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical model of the reproductive endocrine system in male sheep</field><field name="creator">Ferasyi, Teuku Reza</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The activity of the reproductive endocrine axis is the result of interactions among many organs and tissues, particularly the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and gonad. However, it depends on more than the communication between anatomical structures because it is also affected by genotype, internal factors (e.g., metabolic inputs) and external factors (e.g., photoperiod, socio-sexual cues, stress, nutrition). This multifactorial complexity makes it difficult to use animal experimentation to investigate the pathways and mechanisms involved. Therefore, in this study, I have turned to mathematical modelling. The general hypothesis was that, by modelling the hormonal feedback loop that links the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and gonad, I would be able to discover the critical control points in this homeostatic system. This would allow me to inform and direct research into the processes that control reproduction, including inputs from environmental factors. My studies began with the development of a model of the negative feedback loop through which testosterone controls the secretion of pulses of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the hypothalamus. The model incorporated two critical factors: testosterone concentration and a time delay in the inhibition of the activity of the GnRH 'pulse generator' by testosterone. The general assumptions were: i) there are two positive feedforward processes (GnRH pulses stimulate LH pulses, and, in turn, LH pulses stimulate testosterone secretion); ii) testosterone exerts negative feedback that reduces the frequency of GnRH pulses. The model incorporated a group of equations that represent the GnRH pulse generator, through which the inhibitory effect of testosterone acted to reduce GnRH pulse frequency. Simulations were run with various values for the time delay in feedback and, as model development progressed, the simulations were extended to include combinations of time delays and levels of sensitivity of the GnRH pulse generator to inhibition by testosterone. The output of the simulations showed clearly that a time delay in negative feedback, as well as the concentration of testosterone, can greatly affect the frequency of GnRH pulses and the shape of the GnRH secretory profile. Importantly, the effect of the time delay depends on the sensitivity of the pulse generator to testosterone. In addition, the simulations suggested two additional components that might be involved in the control of the GnRH pulse generator: i) a delay in the rate of adaptation to a change in steroid feedback; and ii) a minimum pulse interval (maximum frequency). These studies iii therefore suggest that the regulation of the activity of the GnRH pulse generator, and thus the frequency and profile of GnRH and LH pulses, requires interactions among these four components. These interactions should be tested in animal experimentation. In the next stage, I extended the model so I could test whether the feedback delay might involve the process of aromatization in which testosterone is converted to oestradiol at brain level. ... This information can be used to direct future experimental studies that will help us to understand the factors that underlie the dynamic behaviour of the hypothalamic and pituitary systems that control reproduction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Livestock -- Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Sheep -- Reproduction -- Endocrine aspects</field><field name="subject">Veterinary endocrinology</field><field name="subject">Mathematical model</field><field name="subject">Reproductive endocrine system</field><field name="subject">Male sheep</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of immune regulation in HIV disease</field><field name="creator">Lim, Andrew Yih-Fan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] HIV infection compromises the ability of the host to mount effective immune responses. In untreated HIV disease, immune activation drives high rates of cell turnover and apoptosis, ultimately leading to abnormal and dysregulated cellular function. Immune activation may also induce the expansion of CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cell populations capable of suppressing anti-HIV responses. Treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) allows the recovery of CD4+ T cell numbers in most patients. Persistent deficiencies in the number and function of CD4+ T cells seen in a proportion of individuals may reflect elevated numbers of Treg cells or an imbalanced regulatory-to-effector cytokine milieu. Furthermore, some patients develop paradoxical illnesses associated with the recovery of cellular function, known as immune restoration disease (IRD). The first part of this thesis addresses the role of CD4+ Treg cells in untreated and treated HIV disease. The second part addresses the phenotype of immune cells that express IL-10 and its receptor in untreated and treated patients, and the role of IL-10 in mycobacterial IRD. Firstly, several cell surface markers were evaluated to find a flow cytometry assay that could be used routinely to identify CD4+ Treg cells in HIV-infected patients. I tested CD25, GITR, CTLA-4, NRP-1 and LAG-3, but their expression did not mirror the expression of FoxP3, an intracellular transcription factor specific to CD4+ Treg cells (Chapter 2). Two published studies then described the use of CD127 to identify CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells in humans. Using CD127, I determined the proportions and numbers of CD4+ Treg cells in untreated HIV-infected patients and in patients in their first year of ART. Proportions of CD4+ Treg cells correlated with the proportions of activated (HLA-DRHI) CD4+ T cells and with plasma HIV RNA levels in untreated patients, but showed an inverse correlation with CD4+ T cell count. In both untreated and treated patients, the proportions and numbers of FoxP3+ cells that expressed CD8 were significantly higher than in uninfected donors. This was clearest in patients with CD4+ T cell counts below 300/'L (Chapter 3). This body of work suggests that the frequencies of CD4+ Treg cells are directly related to the level of HIV-associated immune activation. Phenotyping of FoxP3+CD4+ Treg cells in untreated and treated patients and in uninfected donors revealed that co-expression of CD45RO, CD28, CTLA-4 and markers of activation were similar in all HIV-infected patients and controls. ii FoxP3+CD8+ T cells exhibit lower levels of CD45RO, CD28 and CTLA-4, but higher expression of PD-1 and CD57 (Chapter 4). This suggests that FoxP3+CD8+ T cells may have a reduced functional capacity. It is unclear whether they have regulatory activity by virtue of FoxP3 expression. ... Both patients produced higher levels of IFN? compared with IL-10 in response to mycobacterial antigens. In contrast, patients who experienced uneventful immune reconstitution produced higher levels of IL-10 (Chapter 6). Part 1 of this thesis highlights the importance of using specific cellular markers to identify CD4+ Treg cells, and confirms CD127 as a valuable marker for routine monitoring of blood Treg cells. Part 2 of this thesis demonstrates the important regulatory role of IL-10 in patients receiving ART.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">T cells -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease)</field><field name="subject">Cellular immunity</field><field name="subject">HIV infections</field><field name="subject">Immune response -- Regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of new heterogeneous Fischer-Tropsch catalysts : the incorporation of metal aggregates in mesoporous silicas</field><field name="creator">Hondow, Nicole S.</field><field name="description">Transition metals have been extensively studied as catalysts, and certain metals are known to be highly selective and active for certain processes. It is possible to use metal clusters as models for reactions occurring at metal surfaces, but it is often found that in practical applications these complexes are unstable and break down. It is possible to support or stabilise a metal species on, or in, an inorganic framework, making heterogeneous catalysts. A study of metal cluster chemistry with mixed-donor phosphine ligands was conducted, with several new ruthenium complexes synthesised. The chemistry of metal-sulfur interactions is applicable to the removal of sulfur from crude oil, and in an investigation to this chemistry, the bifunctional ligand HSCH2CH2PPhH was added to ruthenium clusters (Chapter 2). The addition of this sulfur-phosphine ligand to the cluster [Ru3([mu]-dppm)(CO)10] produced the carbonyl substituted cluster [Ru3([mu]-dppm)(H)(CO)7(SCH2CH2PPhH)] and the bridged complex [Ru3([mu]-dppm)(H)(CO)8(SCH2CH2PPhH)Ru3([mu]-dppm)(CO)9], as well as recovery of the starting material. Further reactions with this ligand were examined with [Ru3(CO)12] and other complexes were synthesised with different clusters and ligands (Chapter 2). The M41S materials, MCM-41 and MCM-48, are well ordered porous materials with high surface areas (Chapter 3). The incorporation of three different types of metal species, metallosurfactants, metal clusters and nanoparticles, into these materials was examined in an attempt to make heterogeneous catalysts for the Fischer-Tropsch process. The success of this was studied using characterisation techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and BET surface area measurements. Metallosurfactants containing either copper or cobalt were added directly to the synthesis of the porous materials in an attempt to incorporate the metals into the framework structure of the porous silica (Chapter 3). This resulted in well ordered iv porous materials, but the successful incorporation of the metal species was found to be dependent on several factors. Organometallic clusters containing metals such as copper, iron and ruthenium, with supporting carbonyl ligands, were added post-synthesis to MCM-41 and MCM-48 (Chapter 4). Various reaction conditions were examined in attempts to ensure small particle formation. The optimum incorporation of nanoparticles containing iron and platinum was found to occur when a suspension of pre-made and purified nanoparticles was added post-synthesis to the M41S materials (Chapter 4). These materials resulted in porous silicas with well dispersed, small metal particles. The optimum conditions for the calcination of these new materials were determined, in an attempt to remove the ligands and stabilisers and retain the small metal particle size (Chapter 5). Testing for the Fischer-Tropsch process was conducted in a fixed bed reactor through which a flow of synthesis gas containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen could pass over the material (Chapter 5). Analysis by gas chromatography showed that the major product produced by all materials tested was methane, but other hydrocarbons were produced in small amounts, including hexane.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fischer-Tropsch process</field><field name="subject">Catalysts</field><field name="subject">Heterogeneous catalysis</field><field name="subject">Porous materials</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can the performance of activities of daily living questionnaire identify children with developmental coordination disorder?</field><field name="creator">Hill, Catherine Lindsay</field><field name="description">Currently a lack of guidelines for Criterion B of the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) hampers diagnosis of children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). The Performance of Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (PADL-Q; Dewey, Larkin &amp; Summers, 2004) is a new parent-reported instrument developed to quantify the level of interference in activities of daily living (ADL) experienced by children with DCD and was tested for its efficacy in addressing Criterion B. Thirty-two children aged between 5 and 10 years comprising two matched groups, 16 with DCD (8 boys and 8 girls) and 16 without DCD (8 boys and 8 girls) participated in the study. The aim of the research was to investigate the ability of the PADL-Q to identify differences between children with and without DCD. A further 5 children, in the same age range, who did not have DCD added data that was used to ascertain relationships between the constituent assessments. All children were tested using the MAND (McCarron, 1982) whilst their parents completed the PADL-Q. A set of Tests of Activities of Daily Living (TADL) tasks were devised for the children to perform that further validated parents ratings of children?s ADL performance. A Group x Gender MANCOVA, controlled for age, of the PADL-Q total scores demonstrated that there was a significant difference between the children with and without DCD (F(3,25) = 9.44, p &lt; .001; Wilks' lambda = 0.47). Follow-up univariate tests showed a Group x Gender interaction and simple main effects of this interaction indicated that the PADL-Q did not discriminate between the DCD and non-DCD boys. The ability of the PADL-Q to identify DCD was explored in the concurrent validity against the MAND when using a diagnostic cut-off point. The PADL-Q demonstrated 100% specificity and positive predictive values but only 19% sensitivity and 62% negative predictive values. There was a moderately strong relationship (r = .71), between the PADL-Q total score, considered a measure of Criterion B, and the MAND, a measure of Criterion A (DSMIV- TR, 2000). A two factor (Group x Gender) ANCOVA, controlled for age, of the TADL items revealed a statistically significant effect for DCD only (F(1,19) = 34.65, p &lt; .001). There was a moderate correlation (r = -.64) between the PADL-Q total score and the TADL tasks, indicating that parent-reports are supported by their child?s performance. The PADL-Q appears to have potential as part of the DCD diagnostic process; however, further refinement on a larger sample is necessary before it can be used as an easily-administered guide to ADL performance levels in children.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motor ability in children</field><field name="subject">Developmental disabilities</field><field name="subject">Movement disorders in children</field><field name="subject">Educational surveys</field><field name="subject">Motor control</field><field name="subject">Activities of daily living</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Questionnaire</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and use of a Monte Carlo-Markov cycle tree model for coronary heart disease incidence-mortality and health service usage with explicit recognition of coronary artery revascularization procedures (CARPs)</field><field name="creator">Mannan, Haider Rashid</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The main objective of this study was to develop and validate a demographic/epidemiologic Markov model for population modelling/forecasting of CARPs as well as CHD deaths and incidence in Western Australia using population, linked hospital morbidity and mortality data for WA over the period 1980 to 2000. A key feature of the model was the ability to count events as individuals moved from one state to another and an important aspect of model development and implementation was the method for estimation of model transition probabilities from available population data. The model was validated through comparison of model predictions with actual event numbers and through demonstration of its use in producing forecasts under standard extrapolation methods for transition probabilities as well as improving the forecasts by taking into account various possible changes to the management of CHD via surgical treatment changes. The final major objective was to demonstrate the use of model for performing sensitivity analysis of some scenarios. In particular, to explore the possible impact on future numbers of CARPs due to improvements in surgical procedures, particularly the introduction of drug eluting stents, and to explore the possible impact of change in trend of CHD incidence as might be caused by the obesity epidemic. ... When the effectiveness of PCI due to introduction of DES was increased by reducing Pr(CABG given PCI) and Pr(a repeat PCI), there was a small decline in the requirements for PCIs and the effect seemed to have a lag. Finally, in addition to these changes when other changes were incorporated which captured that a PCI was used more than a CABG due to a change in health policy after the introduction of DES, there was a small increase in the requirements for PCIs with a lag in the effect. Four incidence scenarios were developed for assessing the effect of change in secular trends of CHD incidence as might be caused by the obesity epidemic in such a way that they gradually represented an increasing effect of obesity epidemic (assuming that other risk factors changed favourably) on CHD incidence. The strategy adopted for developing the scenarios was that based on past trends the most dominant component of CHD incidence was first gradually altered and finally the remaining components were altered. iv The results showed that if the most dominant component of CHD incidence, eg, Pr(CHD - no history of CHD) levelled off and the trends in all other transition probabilities continued into future, then the projected numbers of CABGs and PCIs for 2001-2005 were insensitive to these changes. Even increasing this probability by as much as 20 percent did not alter the results much. These results implied that the short-term effect on projected numbers of CARPs caused by an increase in the most dominant component of CHD incidence, possibly due to an ?obesity epidemic, is small. In the final incidence scenario, two of the remaining CHD incidence components-Pr(CABG - no history of CHD) and Pr(CHD death - no CHD and no history of CHD) were projected to level off over 2001-2005 because these probabilities were declining over the baseline period of 1998-2000. The projected numbers of CABGs were more sensitive (compared to the previous scenarios) to these changes but PCIs were not.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease -- Western Australia -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease -- Mortality -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Myocardial revascularization</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo method</field><field name="subject">Markov processes</field><field name="subject">Medicine -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ballad of the never picked : a qualitative study of self-perceived non-musicians' perceptions of their musicality</field><field name="creator">Ruddock, Eve</field><field name="description">Humans are a musical species and every culture has its music. However, twenty individuals out of a cohort of twenty-nine participants in this study judged themselves to be 'not musical'. Through their words, silences and responses, the story of music in the lives of these self-perceived non-musicians uncovered a musical world where concepts of performance, judgment and talent dominate. My investigation into individuals' perceptions of their musicality revealed a pervasive societal belief that individuals were either born 'musical' or they were not; their everyday reality was one where music was perceived as a performance, an object, something that only talented people can 'do'. I planned conversations with participants that aimed to reveal clues that could help to unravel a paradox that lies within music in our Western culture: every young human is intrinsically musical but only some are born with a gift to be musical. Participant convictions that they were not musical deterred some individuals from active engagement in music making. They felt as if they had been left out of the 'musical ballpark'. Details from conversations illustrated a constricting cultural imposition on individuals; this was perpetuated in many schools and also in private music teaching. Data revealed that current educational practice contributed to a denial of a natural birthright and alienated some individuals from being part of a musical community. As their stories revealed failed attempts to engage in music making, iterative contacts created a daunting quantity of data. But there was poetry in participant data. These self-perceived non-musicians simultaneously demonstrated their musicality in the rhythms of their narrative as they denied that they were musical; this emerged as a means to report the research whereby participants' words combined to tell a non-musician's tale. Compelling narrative revealed a society where educational practice does little to address individual musical development. While each story alone was specific and complex, once the stories became woven together as a complex and contradictory whole, the ballad of the never picked captured the essence of a distanced musicality in our Western society. Narrative drove towards meaning. Through interpretation and detailed qualitative analysis, understandings began to emerge from depths of experience and from friction existing within contradictions. Deep within narrative which evolved over a period of five years were perceptions that led to understandings of our cultural reality. Active involvement in this research became part of an emancipatory process for several participants where mutually reflective acts exposed unnecessary impositions from societal expectations. Participant voices uncover a bifurcated reality wherein the musical development of many individuals is undermined through an ignorance of holistic human potential; this musical-unmusical divide is perpetuated in educational practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Musical ability</field><field name="subject">Personality and creative ability</field><field name="subject">Self-perception</field><field name="subject">Perceived musicality</field><field name="subject">Musical/non-musical</field><field name="subject">Music education</field><field name="subject">Self-perception</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of children in a monopoly print medium</field><field name="creator">White, Philippa Anne Reynolds</field><field name="description">This research explores the representation of children and young people in a newspaper. The objective was to develop a 'case study' profile of representations in a monopoly daily newspaper in a geographically-isolated Australian capital city. News content with a primary focus on people aged zero to eighteen years was collected for a 12-month period, and analysed from a constructionist perspective, using agenda-setting, news source, media framing and critical linguistics media analysis techniques. Distinctive features of the research design include the combination of these four analytic techniques and the breadth of the age cohort in the research sample. A large body of research literature is used to 'benchmark' the primary analysis of data, and to inform the analyses of age, 'race' and gender. These data are consolidated in three thematic frames: the Promotional Child, Victim Child and Deviant Child, which underpin the aggregated profile of representations developed in this research. Numerous images are reproduced from the research sample and appear throughout the thesis, embedded in relevant discussions. The concluding chapter of the thesis foregrounds a perception of children as voiceless, vulnerable and violent characters, featured in a discourse on social control. Key observations highlighted in this research include disparities in the degree of overt vernacular criticism applied to children and other minority population groups; and the over-representation of marginalised cohorts in compromising newspaper images. The extensive use of children in promotional contexts appears to be partially obscured by the altruistic function of non-commercial promotions and advocacy campaigns. 'Collisions' between altruistic values and news values were found to be predictive of outcomes coinciding with the interests of a target audience; negative outcomes for socially disadvantaged children; and consistent 'collateral benefits' for the news medium  seemingly regardless of outcomes experienced by other stakeholders.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">West Australian Newspapers</field><field name="subject">Mass media and children</field><field name="subject">Mass media and teenagers</field><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Newspapers -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Newspapers and children</field><field name="subject">Youth reporting</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Media representations of children</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In two minds (novel) ; and A singular voice (dissertation)</field><field name="creator">Albertson, Jennifer</field><field name="description">&lt;abstract&gt;'In Two Minds' is a novel of false beliefs. Set in contemporary Sydney, it deals with the relationship between two sisters in their late thirties, Kara and Linda Hille. Told in the second person singular from the point of view of the elder sister, Linda, it is based around the neurological delusion of the younger sibling, Kara. Kara wrongly believes that their mother, Stella, has been replaced by an impostor, 'Mrs. Whitegloves'. For the greater part, the narrative 'you' relates events in the sisters' lives and deals with issues such as the consequences of condoned child abuse, the dilemma of human cloning and the future of 'the brand' in the light of contemporary global marketing. Linda, an advertising executive, struggles with a formidable work-project, an account that is lost to a competitor, and the mistaken belief that she is responsible for her sister's plight. Shocking graffiti about herself, which appears at the same time as she wins an advertising award, proves to be the catalyst that brings beneficial change to her life. Through the tragedy of confronting her sister's devastation and her own challenges, Linda leaves her job, believing this will allow her to start again - differently. In the final chapter, the difference is registered in a shift from the second person to the consolidated first person method of narration. ABSTRACT  EXEGESIS The dissertation 'A Singular Voice' documents aspects of authorial, psychoanalytical and literary significance in the creation of a fiction which draws on personal material confrontational to the writer. It also discusses some wider (non-fictional and other) uses of the narrative 'you' in order to establish the literary tradition in which the novel 'In Two Minds' may be situated. This disseration examines the use of the second-person singular pronoun 'you' as narrator, mainly in contemporary fiction. It concentrates on the ways in which the narrative 'you' was employed to achieve a 'cover', mask or persona for the 'I' behind the text in the novel 'In Two Minds', and explains why it was necessary to seek such subterfuge. It describes how certain grammatical and rhetorical resources were used to build and maintain 'cover', while at the same time allowing the narrative 'you' to express a particular aspect of the fictional protagonist, address the reader, and sustain the story of which it is the intradiegetic narratee. Related narrative elements include construction of the characters through the use of the narrative 'you', for example the narcissistic mother, Stella; the phantom double, 'Mrs. Whitegloves'; the sufferer of Capgras' delusion, Kara; and the ultimate bearer of the singular 'you' voice, the protagonist Linda.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narration (Rhetoric) -- Psychological Aspects</field><field name="subject">Novel -- English -- Australia -- 21st century\vtexts</field><field name="subject">Persona (Literature)</field><field name="subject">Mothers and daughters in literature</field><field name="subject">Sisters in literature</field><field name="subject">Child abuse in literature</field><field name="subject">Delusions in literature</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapy and literature</field><field name="subject">Second person singular</field><field name="subject">Double deixis</field><field name="subject">Caparas' delusion</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of the mechanisms of wild radish herbicide resistance to PSII inhibitors, auxinics, and AHAS inhibitors</field><field name="creator">Friesen, Lincoln Jacob Shane</field><field name="description">The objective of this Ph.D. research was to identify new and novel mechanisms of wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.) resistance to photosystem II (PSII) inhibitors, auxinics, and acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) inhibitors. PSIIinhibitor resistance was demonstrated to be target-site based, and conferred by a Ser264 to Gly substitution of the D1 protein. Auxinic resistance was associated with reduced herbicide translocation to the meristematic regions of resistant wild radish plants. Two new resistance mutations of wild radish AHAS were discovered, including one encoding the globally rare Asp376 to Glu substitution, and another encoding an Ala122 to Tyr substitution, which has never been identified or assessed for resistance in plants previously. Characterization of the frequency and distribution of AHAS resistance mutations in wild radish from the WA wheatbelt revealed that Glu376 was widespread, and that some mutations of AHAS are more common than others. Computer simulation was used to examine the molecular basis of resistance-endowing AHAS target-site mutations. Furthermore, through the computer-aided analysis, residues were identified with the potential to confer resistance upon substitution, but which have not previously been assessed for this possibility. Results from this Ph.D. research demonstrate that diverse, unrelated mechanisms of resistance to PSII inhibitors, auxinics, and AHAS inhibitors have evolved in wild radish of the WA wheatbelt, and that these mechanisms have accumulated in some populations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radishes -- Control -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Herbicide resistance</field><field name="subject">Plants --  Effect of herbicides on</field><field name="subject">AHAS/ALS inhibitor resistance</field><field name="subject">Auxinic herbicide resistance</field><field name="subject">PSII inhibitor resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental changes to ecosystem properties and processes linked to plant invasion and fire frequency in a biodiverse woodland</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Judith L.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Mediterranean southwest Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot, has nutrient deficient soils, exacting climatic conditions and is species rich with 7380 native vascular plant species, of which 49% are endemic. The region is expected to experience one of the world's highest degrees of biodiversity loss and change in the coming decades, with introduced species presenting a major threat. Limited knowledge is available on the mechanisms of ecosystem change associated with invasion and fire in this biodiversity hotspot region. Banksia woodland, an iconic complex species-rich natural ecosystem is one of the major vegetation types of the coastal sandplain, extending from 15 to 90 km inland and 400 kms along the west coast. The following hypothesis was tested to explore the ecological impacts of invasion: Is invasion of Banksia woodland by the introduced species Ehrharta calycina and Pelargonium capitatum accompanied by an alteration in ecosystem properties and processes, whereby the degree of change is related to fire frequency and abundance of introduced species? Different vegetation conditions, i.e. Good Condition (GC), Medium Condition (MC), Poor Condition invaded by Ehrharta calycina (PCe) and Poor Condition invaded by Pelargonium capitatum (PCp) were utilized for field assessments. ... In the soil seed bank, species numbers and germinant density decreased significantly for native and seeder (fire sensitive) species between GC sites and invaded sites. Surprisingly 52% of germinants at GC sites were from introduced species, with much of the introduced soil seed bank being persistent. Native species were dominated by perennial shrubs, herbs and sedges, while introduced species were dominated by perennial and annual grasses and herbs. Invasion by introduced species, associated with frequency of fire, altered the ecosystem, thus disadvantaging native species and improving conditions for even greater invasion within the Banksia woodland. Significantly higher soil phosphorus P (total) and P (HCO3) were found at PCe and PCp sites compared to GC sites. Leaf nutrient concentrations of phosphorus were significantly higher, and potassium and copper significantly lower in PCe and PCp sites, with introduced species having significantly greater concentrations than native species (except Manganese). This study demonstrated the key role of phosphorus in the Banksia woodland, in contrast to other research which identified nitrogen as the major nutrient affected by invasion. Higher levels of soil and leaf phosphorus, loss of species diversity and function, changes in fire ecology and canopy cover and a limited native soil seed bank make restoration of a structural and functional Banksia woodland from the soil seed bank alone unlikely. Without management intervention, continuing future fire is likely to result in a transition of vegetation states from GC to MC and MC to PC. The knowledge gained from this study provides a better ecological understanding of the invasive process. This enhanced understanding will enable the development of adaptive management strategies to improve conservation practices within a biodiversity hotspot and reduce the impact of the key threatening process of invasion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Banksia -- Western Australia -- Perth Region</field><field name="subject">Forest ecology -- Western Australia -- Perth Region</field><field name="subject">Fire ecology -- Western Australia -- Perth Region</field><field name="subject">Plant invasions -- Western Australia -- Perth Region</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leaf-litter and microsite on seedling recruitment in an alley-planted E. sargentii and Atriplex spp. saline agricultural system</field><field name="creator">Farrell, Claire</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In order to assess the sustainability of mixed plantings on saline land, this thesis examined the importance of leaf-litter trapping and microsites on recruitment in a salt affected alley-belted (tree/shrub) agricultural system in Western Australia. Located in the low rainfall region (MAR &lt;330 mm) of the wheatbelt, the 60 ha site consists of concentric rows of Eucalyptus sargentii trees with mounded (6 - 11 cm high) 10 -15 m inter-rows of Atriplex spp. Sustainability of this system and fulfilment of productive and ameliorative functions is dependant on successful recruitment (perennials). Although the present study site was conducted on farmland in a Mediterranean-type climate, low annual rainfall and spatial arrangement of perennial shrubs and trees, allow useful comparisons to be made with naturally occurring banded semi-arid systems and vice-versa. Of key interest were leaf-litter redistribution and trapping by tree and shrub rows and whether litter-cover/microsites facilitated/interfered with seedling recruitment (establishment, growth and survival). Litter from the tree row, redistributed by prevailing winds and rain, accumulated adjacent to saltbush seeding mounds, creating a mosaic of bare and littered areas across the site (total litter 10 t/ha over 22 months). Accumulated litter was hypothesized to differentially influence seasonal soil abiotic parameters (depending on litter-cover density) including; salinity, water availability, infiltration rates, water repellency and temperature. These abiotic conditions were also hypothesized to vary between tree and shrub microsites. Biotically, recruitment at this site was also hypothesized to be determined by interactions (positive and negative) between perennial components and understorey annuals/perennial seedlings. Accumulation of litter and resultant heterogeneity was influenced by shrub morphology, microtopography, wind direction and distance from litter source, with increased litter on the leeward sides of hemispherical Atriplex undulata shrubs and shrubs closest to tree rows. ...  The importance of tree/shrub microsites varied seasonally, with no influence in winter due to moderate temperatures and increased water availability. In warmer months saltbush mid-row microsites were most favourable for seedling recruitment due to moderate litter-cover; reducing salinity, temperatures and increasing infiltration; and reduced root-competition/shading by the tree row. Tree microsites also directly inhibited seedling recruitment through increased salinities and water repellency. However, trees also indirectly facilitated recruitment in adjacent areas through provision of leaf-litter. As litter-trapping and recruitment patterns at this site mirror those found in semi-arid natural and artificial systems, the results of this study provide useful insights into creating appropriate mimics of low rainfall natural banded woodland and chenopod shrublands. Saltbush seeding mounds, shrub morphology and litter were key components for litter trapping and recruitment heterogeneity at this site. In this tree/shrub alley planting, where litter quantities directly influence vegetation cover densities, future saline plantings need to consider appropriate tree/shrub row spacings and orientation for efficient resource (seeds, litter and water) capture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Restoration ecology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Revegetation -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Soils, Salts in -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Atriplex</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Facilitation and competition</field><field name="subject">Saltbush</field><field name="subject">Seedling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relevance of strategic human resource management (SHRM) for the growing small business</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Louise C.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The commercial developments of the late 20th and early 21st centuries have come to signify profound and far-reaching change in the way that goods and services are designed, produced, marketed and delivered to customers in the world's international and domestic markets. In order to respond to a more intensively competitive trading environment that demands ever-increasing levels of product quality, customer service, organisational efficiency and business performance, the management of business entities has undergone fundamental alteration in form and content. It is within this context that two traditionally disparate business disciplines have emerged to play an important role in the new economic commercial order, that of small business management and that of Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM). Historically eclipsed by the large and powerful mass-producing corporations, the small business sector has been more recently viewed as playing an increasingly prominent part in the creation of national and regional prosperity within the developed countries. The unprecedented interest in smaller firms and the desire to see them fulfill their economic and social potential have resulted in legislative reform and widespread initiatives by governments and other institutions designed to support and protect the smaller operators in their commercial endeavours. Similarly, in the post-industrial knowledge economy people have risen in prominence over other organisational resources as a key source of competitive commercial advantage. The role of intellectual capital in securing business success has fuelled the development of management technology and methods designed to enhance the contribution of human resources to business performance. Heralded by many as the defining managerial approach for enterprises that wish to build sustainable competitive advantage in the markets of today and the future, SHRM has come to the fore as a means to re-evaluate the importance of human contribution to business outcomes and guide management practice in leveraging the latent potential of a company's human assets. ... In general, the management of business strategy was found to possess low levels of structure and formality, effectively merging into the collective activities associated with owning and operating a small business. Similarly, when compared with the key elements of a strategic human resource management framework constructed specifically for this study, the data indicated that the strategic management of people is prevalent in smaller firms but that this again represents only partial adoption of normative models as commonly promoted for the larger business management context. It was concluded that the theoretical principles and concepts of SHRM demonstrate relevance for small companies on account of the status of the contemporary external commercial environment in which they must compete as well as the range of managerial benefits associated with strategic methodology and practice. However, currently there exist no suitable models of practice with supporting guidelines that respond to the unique contextual and operational needs and experiences typical of smaller firm owner-managers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personnel management</field><field name="subject">Small business -- Personnel management</field><field name="subject">Small business -- Western Australia -- Case studies</field><field name="subject">Strategic human resource management</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between Scylla and Charybdis : Cyprus and the problem of engineering political settlements for divided societies</field><field name="creator">Yakinthou, Christalla</field><field name="description">Conflict in deeply divided societies often has a profound impact both on the societies in which the conflict is located, and on the surrounding states and societies. Constitutional engineers working in such societies are inevitably attracted to power-sharing as a means of stabilising inter-group relations. Consociational democracy is a form of power-sharing democracy which is particularly attractive for a divided society, because its demands on the society are relatively few. It aims to separate the communities in the conflict as much as possible, while emphasising elite co-operation in the formal institutions of government. A difficulty with consociational democracy, however, is that the elite co-operation it requires to function is also required for the system to be adopted, yet will not necessarily be present. Cyprus is an excellent example of the difficulty of gaining agreement on a consociational regime for a divided society. In 1963, the consociational Republic of Cyprus collapsed as a result of mistrust between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. In 2004, a consociational system of government was designed for Cyprus by a team of UN experts under the direction of then-Secretary-General, Kofi Annan. The system of government was rejected in April 2004 at a referendum, and, consequently, was not adopted. This thesis examines why Cyprus has thus far been unable to adopt a political settlement. Failure is as hard to explain as success. Success may have many fathers and failure none, but there are as many possible causes of a failure as of a success. There is also the difficulty of the counter-factual: what facts would need to be different to produce success where experience is only of failure. The thesis systematically examines possible causes of failure, including the idea of consociational democracy itself, the particular consociational designs proposed for Cyprus, and the influence of historical aspirations and experiences. Particular attention is paid to the idea that there may be key factors which must be present before a consociational solution can be adopted. The factors, selected for this case study for their apparent relevance to Cyprus, are elite co-operation, segmental isolation, a balance of power between the disputant groups, and the ability of the international community to offer incentives for compromise. It is argued that these factors, especially elite relations and the complex web of causes which determine these, are central to an explanation of the Cyprus experience.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Political violence -- Cyprus</field><field name="subject">Ethnic conflict -- Political aspects</field><field name="subject">Elite (Social sciences) -- Cyprus</field><field name="subject">Consensus (Social sciences)</field><field name="subject">Cyprus -- Ethnic relations</field><field name="subject">Cyprus -- Government and politics</field><field name="subject">Constitutional engineering</field><field name="subject">Divided societies</field><field name="subject">Ethnic conflict</field><field name="subject">Cyprus conflict</field><field name="subject">Greek Cypriot</field><field name="subject">Annan plan</field><field name="subject">Turkish Cypriot</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grain and artificial stimulation of the rumen change the abundance and diversity of methanogens and their association with ciliates</field><field name="creator">Christophersen, Claus</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In Australia, there is pressure to reduce the amount of methane produced by ruminant livestock because they are the single largest source of methane emitted from anthropogenic sources, accounting for 70.7% of agricultural methane emissions. In addition, methane production represents a loss of gross energy intake to the animal. The organisms that are responsible for methane production in the animal gut are a distinct group of Archaea called methanogens. Methanogens occupy three different niches within the rumen. Some live freely in the rumen digesta (planktonic), others are attached to the outer surface of the rumen ciliates (ectosymbiotic), and some reside within the ciliates (endosymbiotic). The types and number of methanogens, as well as rumen ciliates and their symbiotic interactions, influence the amount of methane produced from the rumen. These factors in turn are affected by many factors, including diet and ruminal retention time. In this thesis, I tested the general hypothesis that increasing the amount of grain in the diet and reducing the retention time would affect the abundance and diversity of methanogens in their different niches, including their association with ruminal ciliates. Twenty-four fistulated sheep were used in a complete factorial design with the sheep randomly divided into four groups. ... The change in DGGE banding patterns and Shannon indices when sheep were fed grain indicated that the types of methanogens changed when sheep were fed low and high grain diets, but their diversity did not. In contrast, the diversity of rumen ciliates decreased when sheep were fed a high grain diet. A total of 18 bands from the DGGE analysis of the ciliates were sequenced. All except one, which was 98% similar to Cycloposthium sp. not found previously in the rumen, matched the sequences for previously identified rumen ciliates. Some of the rumen ciliates identified were not present in sheep fed the high grain diet. On a high grain diet, methanogens associate endosymbiotically with rumen ciliates to get better access to hydrogen. It appears that the association between methanogens and rumen ciliates is dictated by the availability of hydrogen in the rumen and not the generic composition of the ciliate population. Furthermore, endosymbiotic methanogens appear to produce less methane than methanogens in other niches. The pot scrubbers did not change ruminal retention time but they did reduce the acetate/propionate measurements observed in sheep on the high grain treatment. The reason why pot scrubbers had this effect remains unknown, but it is interesting to consider that some physical interaction has occurred between the pot scrubbers, the grain and the sheep that has improved the fermentation parameters in sheep fed a high grain diet. The results from this study have advanced our understanding of the interaction between methanogens and ruminal ciliates, and methanogenesis in the rumen in response to dietary changes and mechanical challenges. Extending this work to look more specifically at the species of methanogens that are most closely linked to high methane production and how they interact with the ruminal ciliates will be critical for manipulating enteric greenhouse gas emissions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Farm manure in methane production</field><field name="subject">Sheep -- Feeds</field><field name="subject">Rumen -- Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Endosymbiosis</field><field name="subject">Archaebacteria</field><field name="subject">Methanobacteriaceae</field><field name="subject">Methane</field><field name="subject">Greenhouse gases</field><field name="subject">Methane production</field><field name="subject">Rumen archaea (methanogens)</field><field name="subject">Rumen ciliates</field><field name="subject">Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis</field><field name="subject">Real-time PCR</field><field name="subject">Volatile fatty acids</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relevance of specific molecular and cellular effectors during murine cytomegalovirus infection</field><field name="creator">Sumaria, Nital</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The design and development of effective anti-viral immunotherapies requires a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that are involved in the generation and regulation of immune responses. The fundamental objective of the immune system is to successfully complete the task of eliminating/controlling the invading pathogen without causing overt pathology. Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are large DNA viruses that are able to evade immune attack and persist lifelong within the host. In a healthy host, CMV causes an asymptomatic infection, but in instances of decreased immune functions, such as in newborns, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients and transplant recipients, the infection can result in serious morbidity and mortality. Thus, human CMV (HCMV) is a clinically important pathogen and an understanding of the pathogenesis, mechanisms of immune subversion and, importantly the cascade of immune events that ensue following infection is highly relevant. The studies presented in this thesis have provided useful insight into various aspects of viral immunity and it is hoped that they will assist in the design of more effective therapies against viruses of clinical importance. Genetic variability in humans can greatly influence anti-viral immune responses and the outcome of viral infection. ... Furthermore, these studies provide novel evidence that NK cells are also crucial for the control of virus in some organs of susceptible mice during early acute infection. The data reveals that both NK cells and CD8+ T cells utilise perforin- and IFN-? dependent control of MCMV. Furthermore, these studies provide novel evidence that protection mediated by Ly49H+ NK cells in resistant mice is dependent on perforin. Chapter 3 focuses on the biological relevance of Grz during MCMV infection. These studies found that GrzA and GrzB are essential components of the machinery involved in limiting MCMV during acute infection. These analyses also provide the first evidence suggesting that GrzM plays a role, albeit minor, in controlling MCMV replication. Furthermore, the current studies suggest that Grz can mediate direct antiviral activities independent of the induction of cell death in conjunction with perforin. Interestingly, in the absence of both GrzA and GrzB (GrzAB), mice were as susceptible to MCMV infection as perforin-deficient mice. However, unlike perforin-deficient mice, GrzAB-deficient mice controlled and survived the infection. In Chapter 4 the roles of perforin, GrzA and GrzB in anti-viral immunity and immunopathology during MCMV infection were examined. These studies show that NK cell-derived perforin is required to eliminate infected targets as well as activated effector cells, suggesting that NK cells are crucial not only in defensive immunity but also in limiting the immune activation that follows MCMV infection. In summary, the studies presented in this thesis define the significant role played by specific effector molecules in limiting MCMV replication during different stages of this viral infection. Furthermore, these studies provide novel evidence that perforin, GrzA and GrzB play distinct roles in defensive immunity and limiting immunopathology during MCMV infection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytomegaloviruses -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Cytomegaloviruses -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Immune response -- Molecular  aspects</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Viruses</field><field name="subject">Perforin</field><field name="subject">Granzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of spatial, vertical and seasonal distribution of palynomorphs in two Perth metropolitan wetlands</field><field name="creator">Sirr, Susan</field><field name="description">Forensic Palynology has helped to solve crimes ranging from fraud to murder. Pollen is ubiquitous, almost indestructible and microscopic in size. It is often sticky and easily carried, undetected, from one place to another. As pollen is unique to a plant species, combinations of pollen types (pollen assemblages) present in soil or other samples can identify the type of environment, and often the exact location, from which a sample originated. Although Forensic Palynology has been used routinely in New Zealand for over 25 years, is commonly used in the United Kingdom and has been used in several cases in Australia in the past ten years, little research has been done in this field. In Australia, police require an initial broad palynological analysis of samples from a crime scene prior to approving a more detailed analysis. This project investigates palynological samples from two superficially similar environments that could potentially be a crime scene and alibi location, in order to determine if they can be broadly distinguished from each other. Two Perth metropolitan wetlands, Herdsman Lake and Eric Singleton Bird Sanctuary, were chosen for study as potential sites for assaults and clandestine burials. Four sites within each wetland, with correspondingly similar vegetation communities, were sampled at surface level in different seasons. At three sites, 50 cm cores were taken and sampled at seven levels to simulate shallow grave profiles. Samples were prepared and analysed using standard palynological techniques. Surface and core (grave profile) pollen assemblages were compared site by site within each wetland, and with the corresponding site of the other wetland. The grave profile assemblages for each core were combined and averaged to represent mixed 'burial assemblages', and similarly compared across and within wetlands. Palynological analysis established that the surface soil samples were characteristic of wetland environments. The different vegetation sites in each wetland, and the corresponding vegetation site in the other wetland, were broadly palynologically distinct. The season in which samples were collected was difficult to determine. Grave profile assemblages generally differed from surface samples at each site, and broadly differed across and between the two wetlands, but the differences in the 'burial assemblages' were less marked. The findings of this study confirm that broad palynological analysis can differentiate between two wetlands at surface level and downhole, and that samples at different depths in a grave should be separately analysed.

United Kingdom government educational policy, influenced by the global knowledge economy, has shifted responsibility for learning work skills from the workplace to schooling and post-compulsory education. Government policy emphasises the importance of education's role in preparing students with the skills, knowledge and understanding required to enhance the United Kingdom's competitiveness in the global market. In contrast to the work-related emphasis of the wider educational context, music education emphasises the enrichment of experience. The value of music education is related to people's needs, and the functions it performs in their lives. Music education should be transformative, creative, enriching and relevant. Participation in music education is motivated by the intrinsic satisfaction of making music, rather than the extrinsic need for work-related competencies and qualifications. Music education competes for students with other subjects in the educational marketplace when the music curriculum ceases to be compulsory at age fifteen. Therefore, it is important to understand how students relate not only to music education, but also to the wider work-related educational context in which their subject participation choices are made. Therefore, the purposes of this study are twofold: (1) to establish an overview of how students perceive music education and the factors that influence their enrolment intentions, and (2) to establish an overview of how students perceive music within the wider context of education. Statements were chosen that were considered representative of the rationales for education presented by the government and the music education community. Questionnaires and interviews were developed using the statements, and were ii administered to a random sample of Year Nine and Ten (GCSE Music and non - GCSE Music) students Music was not a relevant subject for most students. However, the perceptions of a small percentage of students (mainly Music students) did find music education relevant in the ways the literature suggested it should be. The most common influences on enrolment were perceptions of ability and enjoyment (or lack of). Despite the strong emphasis on work-related skills and qualifications in the wider educational context, students generally agreed that Music was a subject better suited to enhancing life and lifestyle than career options. However, reflecting the wider educational context, Music was perceived as being more careers/future study orientated than transformative, creative, enriching and relevant.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">General Certificate of Secondary Education</field><field name="subject">Music -- Examinations</field><field name="subject">Music -- Instruction and study -- Great Britain</field><field name="subject">Music -- Instruction and study -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Music -- Study and teaching (Secondary) -- Great Britain</field><field name="subject">Musical perception in children</field><field name="subject">Partcipation in music education</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecosystem health : the relationship between dryland salinity and human health</field><field name="creator">Speldewinde, Peter Christiaan</field><field name="description">Australia is experiencing widespread ecosystem degradation, including dryland salinity, erosion and vegetation loss. Approximately 1 million hectares (5.5%) of the south-west agricultural zone of Western Australia is affected by dryland salinity and is predicted to rise to 5.4 million hectares by 2050. Such degradation is associated with many environmental outcomes that may impact on human health, including a decrease in primary productivity, an increase in the number of invasive species, a decrease in the number of large trees, overall decrease in biodiversity, and an increase in dust production. The resulting degradation affects not only farm production but also farm values. This study examines the effects of such severe and widespread environmental degradation on the physical and mental health of residents. Western Australia has an extensive medical record database which links individual health records for all hospital admissions, cancer cases, births and deaths. For the 15 diseases examined in this project, the study area of the south west of Western Australia (excluding the capital city of Perth) contained 1,570,985 morbidity records and 27,627 mortality records for the 15 diseases examined in a population of approximately 460,000. Environmental data were obtained from the Western Australian Department of Agriculture?s soil and landscape mapping database. A spatial Bayesian framework was used to examine associations between these disease and environmental variables. The Bayesian model detected the confounding variables of socio-economic status and proportion of the population identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. With the inclusion of these confounders in the model, associations were found between environmental degradation (including dryland salinity) and several diseases with known environmentally-mediated triggers, including asthma, ischaemic heart disease, suicide and depression. However, once records of individuals who had been diagnosed with coexistent depression were removed from the analysis, the effect of dryland salinity was no longer statistically detectable for asthma, ischaemic heart disease or suicide, although the effects of socio-economic status and size of the Aboriginal population remained. The spatial component of this study showed an association between land degradation and human health. These results indicated that such processes are driving the degree of psychological ill-health in these populations, although it remains uncertain whether this 4 is secondary to overall coexisting rural poverty or some other environmental mechanism. To further investigate this complex issue an instrument designed to measure mental health problems in rural communities was developed. Components of the survey included possible triggers for mental health, including environmental factors. The interview was administered in a pilot study through a telephone survey of a small number of farmers in South-Western Australia. Using logistic regression a significant association between the mental health of male farmers and dryland salinity was detected. However, the sample size of the survey was too small to detect any statistically significant associations between dryland salinity and the mental health of women. The results of this study indicate that dryland salinity, as with other examples of ecosystem degradation, is associated with an increased burden of human disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental degradation -- Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Environmental degradation -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Soil salinization -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Rural health -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Rural mental health services -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Bayesian</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterisation of potential neuroprotective proteins induced by erythropoietin (EPO) preconditioning of cortical neuronal cultures</field><field name="creator">Boulos, Sherif</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Clinical therapeutic agents to directly inhibit ischaemic neuronal death are presently unavailable. One approach to developing therapeutics is based upon the identification of proteins up-regulated by 'preconditioning', a natural adaptive response utilised by the neural cells to counter damaging insults, such as ischaemia. Thus, my project aimed to firstly identify proteins differentially expressed following erythropoietin (EPO) mediated neuronal preconditioning and secondly to assess whether any of these proteins possessed neuroprotective activity using in vitro ischaemia like models. To achieve the first aim, it was shown that in vitro neuronal EPO preconditioning could: (i) induce cell signal changes in neuronal cultures, (ii) protect neurons against in vitro ischaemia and (iii) induce differential protein expression. Overall, 40 differentially expressed proteins were identified in cortical neuronal cultures following EPO preconditioning. In order to investigate the neuroprotective or neurodamaging activity of proteins induced by EPO preconditioning I developed an adenoviral expression system for use in neuronal cultures. To this end, I assessed the suitability of four promoters (cytomegalovirus [CMV], rous sarcoma virus [RSV], human synapsin 1 [hSYN1], rat synapsin 1 [rSYN1]) previously used to express proteins in neuronal cultures and demonstrated the superiority of the RSV promoter for this purpose. ... Finally, in order to validate this adenoviral expression system, I over-expressed the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL in neuronal cultures and subsequently confirmed its neuroprotective activity in the in vitro ischaemia and oxidative stress models used in my project. Using this adenoviral vector system and the in vitro oxidative stress model I assessed a number of proteins up-regulated by EPO preconditioning. The results of this preliminary study indicated that cyclophilin A (CyPA), peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) over-expression were neuroprotective. It was subsequently verified that adenoviral mediated over-expression of CyPA and PRDX2, v but not SOD1 in cortical neuronal cultures could protect neurons from in vitro ischaemia. I also confirmed that CyPA mRNA increased in the rat hippocampus in response to 3 minutes of global cerebral ischaemia. Interestingly, an increase in CyPA, PRDX2 or SOD1 protein was not observed in the same experimental paradigm. To investigate CyPA's mode of action I confirmed that cultured neurons, but not astrocytes, express the CyPA receptor, CD147. It was also demonstrated that administration of exogenous CyPA protein to neuronal cultures could protect neurons against oxidative and ischaemic injury. I further demonstrated that exogenous administration of CyPA induces a rapid and transient activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway in neuronal cultures. From this observation, I have proposed that the extracellular mediated neuroprotective activity of CyPA occurs via CD147 receptor signalling and activation of ERK1/2 pro-survival pathways. Based on the findings reported in this thesis, the neuroprotective activities of PRDX2 and CyPA warrant further investigation as targets for the development of new therapies to treat cerebral ischaemia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteins -- Identification</field><field name="subject">Cerebral ischemia -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Neurons</field><field name="subject">Cell death</field><field name="subject">Erythropoietin</field><field name="subject">Neuroprotective proteins</field><field name="subject">Cortical neuronal cultures</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small, no-take marine protected areas and wave exposure affect temperate, subtidal reef communities at Marmion Marine Park, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Kylie A.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The ecological effects of marine protected areas (MPAs) in temperate ecosystems are poorly understood relative to their tropical counterparts. The limited number of rigorous empirical studies supporting existing theoretical models, increasing public awareness of the importance of marine conservation strategies and legislative requirements to review management effectiveness provide further impetus to study temperate MPAs. Investigations should consider confounding effects of natural variability if MPA effects are to be clearly demonstrated. This research helps to address these needs by investigating the short term effects of sanctuary zones (no-take MPAs where fishing is prohibited) and wave exposure at Marmion Marine Park, Western Australia. The three sanctuary zones at Marmion Marine Park are extremely small (0.061  0.279 km2) compared to most reported in the literature. The sanctuary zones are nested within a larger, fished zone (94.95 km2). The sanctuary zones have been protected from fishing since the year 2000. A post-hoc, asymmetrical sampling design was used in this study and involved surveys of fishes, mobile invertebrates and macroalgae at one sanctuary zone and two fished sites (controls) at each of three successive, subtidal reef lines. The three reef lines are exposed to a gradient in wave energy. The size structure and abundance of the heavily exploited Panulirus cygnus (Western Rock Lobster) were positively affected by protection from fishing in sanctuary zones, despite the highly mobile nature of this migratory species. The mean abundance of legal size lobsters was higher in sanctuary zones compared to fished sites during an interannual study (2003, 2005 and 2006). The total abundance of lobsters and the mean abundance of legal size lobsters were higher at inshore and offshore sanctuary zones compared to fished control sites during a 2005/2006 fishing season study. These zoning effects did not vary with the time of survey. ... Furthermore, the abundance of large lobsters in sanctuary zones decreased with the duration of the 2005/2006 fishing season. Similarly, it is likely that sanctuary zones are too small relative to the movement of fishes to adequately protect stocks of some targeted species. The small sanctuary zones at Marmion are unlikely to offer protection to highly mobile species over the long term. And finally, ecological assemblages within each level of wave exposure are distinct. Consequently for each assemblage type, the current reserve design does not include replication of sanctuary zones and does not offer any 'insurance' in the event of isolated impacts affecting a particular zone. This study has identified the benefits and deficiencies of the design and function of small no-take temperate MPAs in Western Australia. An increase in the size and number of sanctuary zones within each wave exposure level will help to address the v shortfalls of the zoning scheme and enhance the conservation benefits of management at Marmion Marine Park. More generally, this study demonstrates that the mobility of the species to be protected from fishing should be considered when designing MPAs. Lessons learned from this work will be beneficial for the future management and conservation of resources in the region and elsewhere.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marmion Marine Park (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Marine parks and reserves -- Western Australia -- Marmion</field><field name="subject">Reef ecology -- Western Australia -- Marmion</field><field name="subject">Marine resources conservation -- Western Australia -- Marmion</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elucidating novel aspects of hypothalamic releasing hormone receptor regulation</field><field name="creator">Dromey, Jasmin Rachel</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) form one of the largest superfamilies of cell-surface receptors and respond to a vast range of stimuli including light, hormones and neurotransmitters. Although structurally similar, GPCRs are regulated by many diverse proteins, which allow the specific functions of each receptor to be carried out. This thesis focussed on two well-documented GPCRs, the thyrotropin releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), which control the thyroid and reproductive endocrine pathways respectively. Although each of these anterior pituitary receptors is responsible for distinct physiological responses, both are integral to normal development and homeostasis. This thesis focused on three areas of GPCR regulation: ?-arrestin recruitment, transcription factor regulation and receptor up-regulation. The role of the cytoplasmic protein, ?-arrestin, has perhaps been previously underestimated in GPCR regulation, but it is now increasingly apparent that ?-arrestins not only inhibit further G-protein activation and assist in GPCR internalisation but also act as complex scaffolding platforms to mediate and amplify downstream signalling networks for hours after initial GPCR activation. It is therefore becoming increasingly important to be able to monitor such complexes in live cells over longer time-frames. ... Members of the E2F transcription family have been previously identified by this laboratory as potential GnRHR interacting proteins, via a yeast-2-hybrid screen and BRET. This thesis further investigated the role of E2F family members and demonstrates that a range of GPCRs are able to activate E2F transcriptional activity when stimulated by agonist. However, despite GnRHR displaying robust E2F transcriptional activation upon agonist stimulation, this did not result in any conclusive evidence for functional regulation, although it is possible E2F may modulate and assist in GnRHR trafficking. Furthermore it is apparent that E2F family members are highly redundant, as small effects in GnRHR binding and cell growth were only observed when protein levels of both E2F4 and E2F5 were altered. During the course of the investigation into the effect of E2F transcription on GPCR function, it was evident that long-term agonist stimulation of GnRHR had a profound effect on its expression. As this was explored further, it became clear that this agonist-induced up-regulation was both dose- and time-dependent. Furthermore, altering levels of intracellular calcium and receptor recycling/synthesis could modulate GnRHR up-regulation. In addition, an extremely sensitive CCD camera has been used for the first time to visualise the luciferase activity attributed to GnRHR up-regulation. Overall, this thesis demonstrates the complex nature of GPCR regulation. For the first time, long-term BRET analysis on ?-arrestin interactions with both classes of GPCRs has been examined in a variety of cellular formats. This has given valuable insights into the roles of phosphorylation and internalisation on ?-arrestin interaction. Additionally, this thesis has revealed that prolonged agonist exposure increases receptor expression levels, which has major implications for drug therapy regimes in the treatment of endocrine-related disorders and tumours.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Endocrinology</field><field name="subject">Hypothalamic hormones</field><field name="subject">Thyrotropin releasing hormone -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">Gonadotropin releasing hormone -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">Endocrine glands -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">GPCR</field><field name="subject">BRET</field><field name="subject">?-arrestin</field><field name="subject">GPCR function and regulation</field><field name="subject">Up-regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cerium chloride inhibition for high strength low alloy steel exposed to sulphide polluted seawater</field><field name="creator">Coimbatore Dhandayuth, Venkatesh</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Corrosion of steel structures caused by sulphide is a common engineering problem encountered by many industries, such as the petroleum, chemical processing, mining and mineral processing industries. The control of sulphide corrosion is still a controversial topic among corrosion engineers. There is an absence of guideline for a reliable acceptable limit of sulphide level in service and each processing industry has its own empirical values. Selection of inhibitors in the sulphide environment depends on laboratory testing before its actual application in pipelines and reaction vessels. Many investigators have postulated the corrosion mechanisms due to sulphide based on operating envelopes such as pH, chloride, manganese, hydrogen sulphide, sulphate reducing bacteria levels and inhibitor concentration. It is recommended in the literature that the batch dosing of inhibitor and biocide needs to be evaluated in regards to sulphide reducing bacteria (SRB) level, which may produce sulphide concentrations up to 2000 ppm. Although sulphide scale formation may protect the base metal by providing a physical barrier, the detrimental effects of sulphide are often inevitable, such as stress corrosion cracking, hydrogen embrittlement, etc. Currently, there are many chemicals that are used as inhibitors to prevent corrosion by scavenging the sulphide from the environment. Cerium, a rare-earth element, is not used as inhibitor in the sulphide environment. Also, there are no previous research findings on the effects of compounds of rare-earth metals, such as cerium chloride (CeCl3), in sulphide environment. This research examines the corrosion behaviour of 0.4Mo-0.8Cr steel, a High Strength Low Alloy (HSLA) steel, in sulphide-polluted artificial seawater with the addition of CeCl3 and glutaraldehyde. ... It is postulated that the moderate inhibiting effect of CeCl3 is due to the scavenging effect thereby forming Ce2S3 complex. Further reaction of sulphide with steel resulted in ferrous sulphide, leading to an increased corrosion rate. It is also concluded that the CeCl3 interferes with both anodic and cathodic reactions in deaerated conditions. Addition of glutaraldehyde in the sulphide-polluted seawater was found to decrease the corrosion rate. According to the electrochemical measurements conducted, the concurrent addition of glutaraldehyde and CeCl3 appeared to have an added effect on reducing the corrosion of the steel, as evidenced by the increase of the open circuit potential during the short-term testing. From the weight loss measurements after 60 days, sulphide pollution in deaerated seawater was found to increase corrosion rate. This is attributed to the increase of sulphide activity whereby continual dissolution of steel was encountered. From the weight loss tests, it was found that the addition of CeCl3 and glutaraldehyde reduced the corrosion rate of the steel in the solutions containing 0-10 ppm sulphide. There is no noticeable corrosion rate decrease for the solution containing 100 ppm sulphide. The added effect of CeCl3 and glutaraldehyde to the SRB medium has resulted in lower corrosion rates. Further detailed experimentation is required to elucidate the corrosion reduction mechanism in glutaraldehyde-containing environments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cerium chloride</field><field name="subject">Metal sulphides</field><field name="subject">Seawater corrosion</field><field name="subject">Steel alloys -- Corrosion</field><field name="subject">Sulphides -- Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Corrosion</field><field name="subject">Sulphide corrosion</field><field name="subject">Steel</field><field name="subject">Corrosion inhibitor</field><field name="subject">Electrochemical technique</field><field name="subject">Cerium chloride</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dietary risk factors for prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia</field><field name="creator">Ambrosini, Gina L</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis examines the potential role of dietary intake in the development of two common conditions affecting the prostate gland; prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Diet is of interest as a potential risk factor for prostate cancer because of geographical variations in prostate cancer incidence and increased prostate cancer risks associated with migration from Asian to western countries. Some geographical variation has been suggested for BPH, but this is less certain. However, both prostate cancer and BPH have potential links with diet through their positive associations with sex hormone levels, metabolic syndrome, increased insulin levels and chronic inflammation. In addition, zinc is an essential dietary micronutrient required for semen production in the prostate gland. The original work for this thesis is presented in six manuscripts of which, four have been published in peer-reviewed journals (at the time of thesis completion). BPH investigated in this thesis is defined as surgically-treated BPH. The following hypotheses were investigated. Regarding foods, nutrients and the risk of prostate cancer and BPH: 1. Increasing intakes of fruits, vegetables and zinc are inversely associated with the risk of prostate cancer and BPH 2. Increasing intakes of total fat and calcium are positively associated with the risk of prostate cancer and BPH. 3. Dietary patterns characterised by high meat, processed meat, calcium and fat content are positively associated with the risk of prostate cancer and BPH. 4. Dietary patterns characterised by high fruit and vegetable and low meat content are inversely associated with the risk of prostate cancer and BPH. v Regarding methodological issues related to the study of diet-disease relationships: 5. Dietary patterns (overall diet) elicited from principal components analysis yield stronger diet-disease associations than when studying isolated nutrients. 6. Remotely recalled dietary intake is reliable enough to be used in studies of chronic disease with long latency periods, such as prostate cancer and BPH. Methods: Data from two studies was used to address the hypotheses above. ... Based on the literature reviewed and the original work for this thesis, the most important dietary risk factors for prostate cancer and BPH appear to be those common to western style diets, i.e. diets high in red meat, processed meat, refined grains, dairy products, and low in fruit and vegetables. This type of diet is likely to result in marginal intakes of antioxidants and fibre, excess intakes of fat and possibly, moderate intakes of carcinogens associated with processed meat and meat cooked at high temperatures. These dietary factors have been linked with biomarkers of inflammation, and they support the hypotheses that chronic inflammation is involved in the development of both prostate cancer and BPH. In addition, this work builds on evidence that zinc is an important factor in prostate health. There is scope for more investigation into the reliability of dietary patterns and the use of nutrient patterns as an alternative to focussing on single food components. Further studies on the reliability of remote dietary intake would also be useful. Because of the latency of chronic disease, it can be theorised that remote dietary recall may uncover more robust diet-disease relationships.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Benign prostatic hyperplasia</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Nutritional aspects</field><field name="subject">Nutritionally induced diseases</field><field name="subject">Prostate -- Cancer -- Nutritional aspects</field><field name="subject">Prostate -- Hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">&lt;keyword&gt;</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The poem as liminal place-moment :  John Kinsella, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Christopher Dewdney and Eavan Boland</field><field name="creator">Reed, Marthe</field><field name="description">Places are deeply specific, and often richly resonant for us in terms of memory, emotion, and association, yet we nevertheless frequently move through them insensible of their constitution and diversity, or the shaping influences they have upon our lives.

The synthesis, stereochemistry, physical properties and functionalisation of 'sarcophagines' and their metal complexes are discussed. A brief overview of the burgeoning field of metallopolymers is given with specific mention of the synthetic routes to pendant metallopolymers, and how these could be employed to prepared cage amine containing metallopolymers. Chapter 2 deals with the synthesis, characterisation and reactivity of cinnamylamino and styrylamido derivatives of the cage amines [Co((NH2)2sar)]3+, [Co((CH3)(NH2)sar)]3+ and [Cu((NH2)2sar)]2+. The cinnamylamino derivatives were prepared using reductive alkylation of the aforementioned amines with cinnamaldehyde. Procedures were developed to isolate the complexes without causing unwanted additions to the double bond. The cinnamylamino derivatives displayed unexpected reactivity towards a range of reducing agents, resulting in unexpected reduction of the double bond and cleavage of the cinnamyl group, but ultimately in the preparation of phenylpropylamino derivatives of [Co((NH2)2sar)]3+ and [Co((CH3)(NH2)sar)]3+. Attempts to rationalise the reactivity of the double bond have been explored based upon the physical properties and reactivity of the double bond. The styrylamido derivatives were prepared by treatment of the cage amines with 4-vinylbenzoyl chloride, and the complexes isolated in a similar manner to those of the cinnamylamino derivatives to ensure the amide linkage remained intact. Most of the complexes have been structurally characterised. ...  Both the 2-thienyl and 3-thienyl derivatives of [Co((NH2)2sar)]3+ and [Co((CH3)(NH2)sar)]3+ have been prepared using reductive alkylation with the respective carboxaldehydes of thiophene. One of the optically pure isomers has been prepared. The complexes have been fully characterised including structural characterisation. Polymerisation of the thiophene-cage amine complexes was investigated under a range of chemical and electrochemical conditions, though polymerisation was never observed. Cleavage of the thienyl groups was observed when ceric ammonium nitrate in nitric acid was used as the oxidant. The attachment of oligothiophenes and mixed pyrrole-thiophene oligomers to cage amines were investigated using reductive alkylation and various pyrrole ring-forming reactions about the apical amino groups, though none of the desired complexes were isolated, reasons for the lack of reactivity were discussed. An efficient synthesis of N-(4-benzoic acid)- 2,5-di(2-thienyl)pyrrole was developed and was shown to the electropolymerisable, albeit the polymer films were non-conducting. Attempts to couple N-(4-benzoic acid)- 2,5-di(2-thienyl)pyrrole with a cage amine via its acid chloride were complicated by decomposition reactions, the nature of one of these products is discussed. Chapter 5 presents investigations into the preparation of simple complexes containing multiple cage amines using alkylation and acylation procedures with aromatic substrates. The complexes were found to exhibit some interesting electrochemical and chemical properties, demonstrating that even simple multiple cage amine species can display complicated and interesting behaviour.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cage-amine</field><field name="subject">Multi-cage complexes</field><field name="subject">Metallomonomers</field><field name="subject">Polythiophene/Polystyrene</field><field name="subject">Amines</field><field name="subject">Electrochemistry</field><field name="subject">Ligands -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Metal complexes</field><field name="subject">Organometallic compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The medical complications of childhood obesity</field><field name="creator">Bell, Lana Michelle</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Introduction: Childhood obesity is currently a serious worldwide public health issue associated with many medical and psychosocial complications.

The study also aims to compare the medical complications of obesity in a community sample who have never sought treatment with a clinical sample who are actively seeking treatment for overweight/obesity. Finally, this study also aims to examine the relationship between the medical complications of childhood obesity and a continuum of children's Body Mass Index z-scores, including those in the normal range. The second study is an exercise intervention study to investigate the effect of exercise on one specific medical complication of obesity, namely insulin resistance. This study aims to determine if a structured eight-week exercise program significantly changes insulin resistance in obese children, and to determine if this decrease in insulin resistance is associated with changes in body composition and inflammatory markers. ... Conclusion: The prevalence of the medical complications of overweight and obesity in primary school children indicates that all children should have body mass index regularly checked from a young age. Children who are overweight/obese should be screened for the presence of co-morbidities despite a young age. Parents and health professionals needs to be educated that childhood obesity is associated with medical co-morbidities and is not simply a social or cosmetic concern. The continuous nature of the BMI z-score/co-morbidities relationship suggests that public health and health education strategies should include adopting a populationbased approach to weight management. This continuous relationship means that even in the normal BMI spectrum, the risk of developing co-morbidities rises with increasing BMI. Such an approach would encourage maintenance of normal weight for all children, rather than targeting overweight/obese children only. Increased activity and decreased sedentary behaviours should be recommended for all children in line with the population-based public health approach suggested above. However, exercise has a specific role in weight management strategies for overweight/obese children, and in management strategies for adiposityrelated co-morbidities. Significant metabolic benefits of exercise occur in the absence of changes in body shape and weight. After an exercise program, simple blood investigations (such as lipid profiles, fasting insulin and OGTTs) are likely to miss important metabolic improvements and anthropometry (BMI calculation, waist circumference) may be more indicative of potential metabolic improvement and decreased co-morbidity risk.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obesity -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Obesity in adolescence -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Obesity in children -- Complications</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of country and higher education images in mainland Chinese students' intention to enroll in a offshore program</field><field name="creator">Li, Jianyao</field><field name="description">Offshore programs have become increasingly popular in countries that are experiencing rapid economic growth and rising demand for higher education. There is no doubt that China is one of the largest markets for offshore programs. However, the offshore program market in China has become increasingly competitive. Currently, institutions from the USA, the UK, and Australia, to name just a few, are offering offshore programs ranging from the professional diploma level to higher degrees such as MA, MBA and PhD. Therefore, understanding how Chinese students select an offshore program is important for competing and surviving in this market place. This study examines the effects of image (i.e., country image and higher education image), attitude, subject norm and perceived behavior control (adopted from Ajzen's theory of planned behavior) in Chinese students' enrollment intentions towards offshore programs from Australia, the UK and the USA respectively. A total number of 1291 valid questionnaires were collected from China for this study. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method was used for data analyses and modeling. This PhD's several major findings have significant theoretical and practical implication. One of the major findings was that country image or its related higher education image doesn't have significant effect on an offshore program evaluation in China. This finding has contradicted most previous studies which suggested that country image had significant impact on whether a consumer purchases the products or brands from a foreign country. The difference between this study and the other country-image studies may be due to the fact that this study studied multiple factors besides country image, while the other studies looked at only the effect of country image on purchasing intention. Although country image or higher education image did not play any significant role in offshore program enrollments, this study found that the image of the partnering or local institution had a significant effect on enrollment intention. Because Chinese students are unfamiliar with a foreign country or their higher education system, they relied heavily on the local institution (e.g., its reputation and quality) to evaluate an offshore program. The findings with respective to image have challenged most previous studies on country image and open a new arena for looking at the effect of country image in behavioral intention. Practically speaking, these findings make universities rethink their offshore program strategies in foreign countries, particularly developing countries. Most university marketers from western countries emphasize on the characteristics of its own (such as the history of the university, the quality of research) when promoting its offshore program overseas. However, this study suggested that the focus should be placed on selecting a good and suitable local partner, as well as emphasizing the characteristics of the local partner. Other major findings were related to the Theory of Planned behavior. This study found that all three components of the TPB, namely, attitude towards the program, subject norm and perceived behavior control had significant effects on enrollment intention. This suggested that for predicting behavioral intention in educational program enrollment, the TPB is a very powerful model.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Students, Foreign</field><field name="subject">College students -- China</field><field name="subject">Chinese students -- Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges -- Marketing</field><field name="subject">Country image</field><field name="subject">Higher education image</field><field name="subject">Chinese student</field><field name="subject">Local institution image</field><field name="subject">Enrollment intention</field><field name="subject">Offshore program</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant growth and nutrient removal in simulated secondary-treated municipal wastewater in wetland microcosmos</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Zhenhua</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The use of constructed wetlands for tertiary purification of municipal wastewater has received increasing attention around the world because direct discharge of secondary-treated municipal wastewater to water bodies has caused eutrophication. Plant species selection and vegetation management may enhance nutrient removal efficiency in constructed wetlands. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the relations between plant growth and nutrient removal efficiency in constructed wetlands. The objective of this study is to better understand how plant growth and resource allocation are influenced by nutrients in wastewater and how nutrient removal efficiencies are affected by plant species and vegetation management. The preliminary experiment was conducted to select macrophytes, especially ornamental species, to grow in the wastewater in the wetland microcosms. Ten plant species, comprising six ornamental species: Alocasia macrorrhiza, Canna indica, Iris louisiana, Lythrum sp., Zantedeschia aethiopica, Zantedeschia sp., and four sedge species: Baumea articulate, Baumea juncea, Carex tereticaulis and Schoenoplectus validus, were planted in the wetland microcosms and fed a simulated wastewater solution in the concentrations similar to the secondary-treated municipal wastewater. C. indica has shown vigorous and healthy growth, and a relatively high potential of rooting-zone aeration and nutrient removal efficiency. B. articulata and S. validus also showed relatively high nutrient removal efficiency. ... The high nutrient availability and optimum N/P ratio were required for stimulating plant growth, resulting in allocation of more resources to above-ground tissues compared to below-ground parts, and enhancing nutrient removal efficiency. Nutrient removal efficiencies were significantly influenced by growth of C. indica and S. validus, nutrient loading rates and N/P ratios in the wastewater. The nutrient uptake kinetics of C. indica and S. validus were investigated to elucidate the differences in nutrient uptake between species. Wetland plant species have shown differential nutrient uptake efficiency and different preferences for inorganic N source, with C. indica preferring NO3-N and S. validus preferring NH4-N. C. indica had greater capacity than S. validus to take up PO4-P when the concentration of PO4-P in the solution was relatively low, whereas S. validus was more capable than C. indica to take up NO3-N when the concentration of NO3-N in the solution was relatively low. The PO4-P uptake capacity was higher in younger than older plants. Overall, the study has suggested that different plant species have differential capacity to take up nutrients. In addition to nutrient uptake, plants have significant other roles in terms of nutrient removal from the wastewater (such as leaking oxygen into the rhizosphere in which oxidation of substances like ammonia can occur). The properly high nutrient availability and optimum N/P ratio are required to stimulate the plant growth, resulting in enhancing the treatment performance in the wetlands. These findings have important implications for improving our ability to engineer ecological solutions to the problems associated with nutrient-rich wastewater.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Constructed wetlands</field><field name="subject">Sewage -- Purification -- Biological treatment</field><field name="subject">Sewage -- Purification -- Nitrogen removal</field><field name="subject">Sewage -- Purification -- Nutrient removal</field><field name="subject">Nutrient pollution of water</field><field name="subject">Water reuse</field><field name="subject">Eutrophication -- Control</field><field name="subject">Schoenoplectus validus</field><field name="subject">Canna indica</field><field name="subject">Plant growth</field><field name="subject">Wastewater</field><field name="subject">Nutrient removal</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental influences on the spatial and temporal distribution of soil macrofauna in a smallholder agriforestry system of western Honduras</field><field name="creator">Pauli, Natasha</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the findings of an investigation of the spatial and temporal distribution of soil macrofauna at multiple scales within smallholder agriforestry fields in a remote, mountainous area of western Honduras. Since 1990, smallholder farmers in the study area have switched from traditional slash-and-burn agriculture to a form of slash-and-mulch agriforestry based on cultivating maize, beans and sorghum amongst dispersed trees. The principal objective was to examine the influence of the slash-and-mulch agricultural system on soil macrofauna abundance, biomass and community composition, and relate soil macrofauna distribution patterns to environmental variables. The initial stage of the research comprised transect-based sampling of soil macrofauna and biophysical variables in four common land uses of the study area. All four land uses (secondary forest, young milpa (agriforestry), mature milpa, and pasture) supported abundant, diverse and heterogeneous soil macrofauna communities, with few notable differences in soil macrofauna distribution among land uses. The most abundant soil macrofauna taxa were termites, ants, earthworms and beetles. Of the 'explanatory' environmental variables that were measured (including land use and selected soil properties, vegetation characteristics and topographic variables), those that had the strongest relationships with soil macrofauna abundance were land use, tree density and soil organic matter content. The second stage of the research was spatially-orientated and used stratified sampling based on within-field differences in farmer-defined soil type, as well as grid-based sampling of soil macrofauna surface activity. There was substantial within-field variation in soil type and topography, which was related to distribution patterns of at least one agriculturally-important soil macrofauna taxon. Earthworm activity was higher in areas of fertile soil and lower slope positions. At a finer scale, there was a positive spatial correlation between tree distribution and earthworm casting activity. The final phase situated the biophysical research in the local socio-economic context through participant observation and interviews with farmers. The results of the three phases of the study were incorporated into an original conceptual model of the relationships among soil macrofauna and environmental variables in the study area across multiple spatial scales and along a chronosequence of land use changes. Specific pointers are provided for further research on the role of soil fauna in influencing soil structure, nutrient cycling and pest species abundance, and for further investigating local knowledge and the socio-economic and cultural drivers of land use change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural systems -- Honduras</field><field name="subject">Soil biology</field><field name="subject">Soil structure</field><field name="subject">Soil macrofauna</field><field name="subject">Honduras</field><field name="subject">Soil biodiversity</field><field name="subject">Central America</field><field name="subject">Smallholder agriculture</field><field name="subject">Agriforestry</field><field name="subject">Spatial ecology</field><field name="subject">Local knowledge</field><field name="subject">Land use change</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integral metatheory for organisational transformation</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Mark Gerard</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a metatheory for the study of organisational transformation. A metatheory is a coherent conceptual system that analyses and accommodates the insights of other theory. In a time of rapidly changing organisational, societal and global environments there is a strong imperative for developing integrative conceptual frameworks that contribute to our understanding and explanation of transformational change. Like other areas of social science, the field of organisational transformation is made up of a multitude of diverse theories that offer useful and valid insights into aspects of transformational phenomena. These theories come from many different theoretical schools and research paradigms and they employ a wide range of explanatory concepts. There are however, no overarching theoretical frameworks specifically developed from metatheory building techniques that might give an overall coherency to the field. Consequently, there is no way of deciding on the relative conceptual merits of particular theories and there is often little justification for adopting one theory over another to explore some aspect of organisational transformation. To fill this gap, this thesis uses conceptual research methods to i) review extant literature, ii) develop a metatheory for organisational transformation and iii) apply this metatheory to the exemplar topic of organisational sustainability. The initial chapters introduce the topics of organisational transformation and metatheory building and provide a rationale for an overarching approach to radical organisational change. Following this, a method for metatheory building is developed and its application in this study is described. A rationale for the sampling procedure and organisational of data is also presented. The metatheory building method involves the use of conceptual theme analysis for identifying the core themes theorists use in describing and explaining organisational transformation. In subsequent chapters, core themes are analysed using the techniques of bridging and bracketing to derive a number of conceptual lenses. These lenses, and the relationships between them, form the central components for the integral metatheory. Having identified and described the basic set of conceptual lenses for transformation, the exemplar topic of organisational sustainability is used to show how the metatheory can be applied to a specific area of research. The final chapter evaluates the integral metatheory with some commonly used criteria for judging the results of conceptual research. A brief evaluation of the chief metatheoretical resource used in the study, i.e., AQAL metatheory, is also carried out. This thesis endeavours to contribute to the field of organisational, transformational and sustainability studies by i) developing a metatheoretical framework for the study of radical organisational change, ii) offering a comprehensive review of paradigms and theories of organisational transformation and their core explanatory concepts, and iii) proposing a more detailed metatheory building method which can make a significant contribution to the conceptual development of many fields within organisational studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Management science</field><field name="subject">Metatheory</field><field name="subject">Organizational change</field><field name="subject">Organizational change -- Management</field><field name="subject">Organisational transformation</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Integral theory</field><field name="subject">Metatheory</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The best of Santalum album : essential oil composition, biosynthesis and genetic diversity in the Australian tropical sandalwood collection</field><field name="creator">Jones, Christopher G.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] An investigation into the causes of heartwood and essential oil content of Australian plantation sandalwood, Santalum album was undertaken. Genetic diversity of 233 S. album, five S. austrocaledonicum and fifteen S. macgregorii trees growing in the Forest Products Commission arboretum, Kununurra WA, was assessed using nuclear and chloroplast RFLPs. Santalum spicatum was chosen as an out-group. Nuclear genetic diversity of the S. album collection was very low, with observed and expected heterozygosity levels of 0.047. This was lower than the results previously reported in the literature for trees in India, however a different technique was used. Based on allelic patterns, the collection was able to be categorised into 19 genotypes; each representing some shared genetic origin. Some groups were highly redundant with 56 trees being represented, while others were populated by just one tree. The essential oil yield and heartwood contents of trees from these genetic groups were compared. Yields were highly variable both within and between groups of trees which share a common genetic history, suggesting a significant environmental component was contributing to the observed phenotype, despite identical soil and climatic conditions. Ancestral lineages were tested using chloroplast RFLPs, although a lack of shared mutations between species made this difficult. Only one S. album tree originating from Timor was resolved using nuclear RFLPs, with the other trees being grouped with material sourced from India. There was no resolution of Indian S. album from Timorese using chloroplast RFLPs, however one S. album tree grown from Indian seed possessed a single unique mutation. The low genetic diversity of the Australian S. album collection is likely to be a combination of incomplete seed sourcing and highly restricted gene flow during the evolution of the species. Combined with information gathered on the phylogeny of the genus by other researchers, S. album is postulated to have originated from an over-sea dispersal out of northern Australia or Papua New Guinea 3 to 5 million years ago. Essential oil yield and composition was assessed for 100 S. album trees growing in the collection, ranging in age from 8 to 17 years. Oil content of heartwood ranged from 30 mg g-1 to 60 mg g-1, and the transition zone 36 mg g-1 to 90 mg g-1. Sapwood contained almost no sesquiterpene oils. Despite the highly variable total oil yields, the chemical profile of the oil did not vary, suggesting there was limited genetic diversity within this region of the genome. Strong, positive correlations existed between v sesquiterpenoids in the essential oil of S. album. ... These represent the first TPS genes to be isolated from sandalwood and will enable further elucidation of oil biosynthesis genes. This thesis compiles a three-pronged approach to understanding the underlying causes of oil yield variation in S. album. As a species for which so little is known, the research presented here provides a major leap forward for tree improvement, breeding and silviculture. Hence the best of Santalum album research is presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Santalenes</field><field name="subject">Sandalwood oil industry -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Biogeography</field><field name="subject">Plant genetics</field><field name="subject">Heartwood</field><field name="subject">Essences and essential oils</field><field name="subject">Sesquiterpenes</field><field name="subject">Biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Santalum album</field><field name="subject">Santalum austrocaledonicum</field><field name="subject">Santalum macgregorii</field><field name="subject">Santalum spicatum</field><field name="subject">Genetic diversity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An e-discourse framework for the qualitative analysis of inquiry-based web forums</field><field name="creator">Abdul Samad, Adlina</field><field name="description">#DEFAULT</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Higher -- Computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">Education, Higher -- Effect of technological innovations on -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Educational technology -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Internet in higher education -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">E-learning</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">No-suicide contracts, no-suicide agreements and no-suicide assurances : an exploratory study of their nature, utilization and perceived effectiveness</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Stephen J.</field><field name="description">The research examined mental health practitioners' attitudes towards, satisfaction with and use of suicide prevention contracting (SPC) techniques. Survey respondents comprised consultant psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, mental health nurses, psychologists, registered medical officers and social workers. A self-report questionnaire was mailed to 1347 potential respondents, together with three follow-up letters sent out at two-week intervals. There was a 31% response rate, producing 420 valid questionnaires. The results of the research re-confirm the historical trajectory of SPC, from its early beginnings as a relationship-based suicide-risk assessment technique to one that is used in contemporary practice by practitioners to meet a range of objectives. The research focused on three SPC techniques in operation in clinical practice: verbal no-suicide assurances, no-suicide agreements, and written no-suicide contracts. Analysis of the data suggests a number of important findings. The first of these is that practitioners perceive different utility among these three techniques. Secondly, the least experienced practitioners were significantly less likely to use no-suicide contracts, despite seeing more suicidality and having more formal training in the use of the technique. Thirdly, a practitioner's gender, and formal training were significant in the perception and application of SPC techniques. Finally, suicidal behaviours and completed suicide was a clinical outcome in some situations irrespective of the use and non-use of SPC. The findings of this research are used to provide an emerging conceptual framework and associated nomenclature that inform clinical decision-making in relation to SPC. In addition, a conceptual model is presented which demonstrates that the potential for injudicious use of SPC techniques is as much precipitated by individual factors as it is by broader environmental factors. Key words: no-suicide contracts, suicide prevention contracts, no-suicide agreements, no-suicide decisions, contingency contracting.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Suicide -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Suicidal behaviour -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Mental health counseling</field><field name="subject">Mental health personnel</field><field name="subject">Suicide prevention contracting</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Birth pains : changing understandings of miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death in Australia in the Twentieth Century</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Susannah Ruth</field><field name="description">Feminist and social historians have long been interested in that particularly female ability to become pregnant and bear children. A significant body of historiography has challenged the notion that pregnancy and childbirth  considered to be the acceptable and 'appropriate' roles for women for most of the twentieth century in Australia - have always been welcomed, rewarding and always fulfilling events in women's lives. Several historians have also begun the process of enlarging our knowledge of the changing cultural attitudes towards bereavement in Australia and the eschewing of the public expression of sorrow following the two World Wars; a significant contribution to scholarship which underscores the changing attitudes towards perinatal loss. It is estimated that one in four women lose a pregnancy to miscarriage, and two in one hundred late pregnancies result in stillbirth in contemporary Australia. Miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death are today considered by psychologists and social workers, amongst others, as potentially significant events in many women's lives, yet have received little or passing attention in historical scholarship concerned with pregnancy and motherhood. As such, this study focuses on pregnancy loss: the meaning it has been given by various groups at different times in Australia's past, and how some Australian women have made sense of their own experience of miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death within particular social and historical contexts. Pregnancy loss has been understood in a range of ways by different groups over the past 100 years. At the beginning of the twentieth century, when alarm was mounting over the declining birth rate, pregnancy loss was termed 'foetal wastage' by eugenicists and medical practitioners, and was seen in abstract terms as the loss of necessary future Australian citizens. By the 1970s, however, with the advent of support groups such as SANDS (Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Support) miscarriage and stillbirth were increasingly seen as the devastating loss of an individual baby, while the mother was seen as someone in need of emotional and other support. With the advent of new prenatal screening technologies in the late twentieth century, there has been a return of the idea of maternal responsibility for producing a 'successful' outcome. This project seeks to critically examines the wide range of socially constructed meanings of pregnancy loss and interrogate the arguments of those groups, such as the medical profession, religious and support groups, participating in these constructions. It will build on existing histories of motherhood, childbirth and pregnancy in Australia and, therefore, also the history of Australian women.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Miscarriage</field><field name="subject">Stillbirth</field><field name="subject">Newborn infants -- Death</field><field name="subject">Women -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Women -- Australia -- History -- 21st century</field><field name="subject">Women -- Australia -- Oral history</field><field name="subject">Motherhood -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Feminist history</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antenatal bladder outflow obstruction : effects of morphology and apoptosis in the fetal kidney, and effects on fetal ACTH and cortisol levels in an ovine model</field><field name="creator">Samnakay, Naeem</field><field name="description">Posterior urethral valves cause bladder outflow obstruction and damage to the developing fetal kidney. Posterior urethral valves affect 1 in 8000 new-born males. A third of these children develop end stage renal failure by adolescence, despite valve ablation in the early post-natal period, implying that majority of the damage to the kidneys occurs in utero. How does this damage occur, and should we intervene in utero? The answers to these questions require further research, and are the basis to this thesis. This thesis focused on the effect bladder outflow obstruction has on morphology and apoptosis in the fetal kidney in a fetal lamb model. It also looked at the effect of bladder outflow obstruction on fetal stress hormone levels. Bladder outflow obstruction was created surgically in fetal lambs at day 70 of gestation, and fetal kidneys were analysed at day 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 after creation of obstruction. Controls undergoing sham surgery were used for comparison. Four aspects were investigated: - effects of bladder outflow obstruction on renal histology  effects of bladder outflow obstruction on expression of pro-apoptosis gene Bax and anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-X - effects of bladder outflow obstruction on renal regional apoptosis  effects of bladder outflow obstruction on serum fetal ACTH and cortisol levels. Bladder outflow obstruction resulted in sequential morphological change in the fetal kidney over time. By 2 days post-obstruction, cystic change was noted. In addition, patchy attenuation of the nephrogenic blastema was evident by 5 days post-obstruction, with more confluent blastemal attenuation as well as generalized renal architectural disorganization by 10 days post-obstruction. By 20 and 30 days post-obstruction, cystic renal dysplasia had developed. Bladder outflow obstruction resulted in an increase in the ratio of renal expression of pro-apoptosis gene Bax to anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-X. Regional apoptosis counts showed increased tubular apoptosis compared to controls at 2 days post-obstruction, and increased blastemal apoptosis compared to controls at 5 days post-obstruction. By 10 days post-obstruction, blastemal apoptosis counts were reduced compared to controls. There were no significant differences in fetal serum ACTH and cortisol levels between fetal lambs with bladder outflow obstruction and controls. In conclusion, the results of this thesis outline the spectrum of morphological change in the fetal kidney over 30 days of bladder outflow obstruction. They show that detectable changes in morphology occur within two days of bladder outflow obstruction. Likewise, detectable changes in gene expression occur within 2 days of bladder outflow obstruction. The increased ratio of expression of Bax to Bcl-X suggests a swing towards increased apoptosis in response to bladder outflow obstruction. Further research is required to ascertain if these changes are reversible. However, the early onset of these changes as shown in this thesis suggests that any fetal intervention to protect the fetal kidney from the effects of bladder outflow obstruction may need to be instituted very early in gestation</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydronephrosis</field><field name="subject">Fetus -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Fetal hydronephrosis</field><field name="subject">Posterior urethral valves</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On combination and interference free window spreading sequences</field><field name="creator">Cresp, Gregory</field><field name="description">Spread spectrum techniques have a number of different applications, including range finding, synchronisation, anti-jamming systems and multiple access communication systems. In each of these applications the properties of the resulting systems depend heavily on the family of spreading sequences employed. As such, the design of spreading sequences is an important area of research. Two areas of spreading sequence design are of particular interest in this work, combination techniques and Interference Free Window (IFW) sequences. Combination techniques allow a new sequence family to be constructed by combining two or more existing families. Such an approach allows some of the desirable properties of the components to be maintained, whilst mitigating the components' disadvantages. In addition, it can facilitate the construction of large families at a greatly reduced computational cost. Combination families are considered through the construction of two new classes of sequences, modified Unified Complex Hadamard Transform (UCHT) sequences, and combination Oppermann sequences, respectively based on UCHT sequences and periodic Oppermann sequences. Numerical optimisation techniques are employed to demonstrate the favourable performance of sequences from these classes compared to conventional families. Second, IFW sequences are considered. In systems where approximate, but not perfect, synchronisation between different users can be maintained, IFW sequences can be employed to greatly reduce both interference between users and interference resulting from multipath spread of each user's signal. Large Area Synchronous (LAS) sequences are a class of sequences which both result from combination techniques and exhibit an IFW. LAS sequences are produced by combining Large Area (LA) sequences and LS sequences. They have been demonstrated to be applicable to multiple access communication systems, particularly through their use in LAS2000, which was proposed for third generation mobile telephony. Work to date has been restricted to only a very small range of examples of these families. In order to examine a wider range of LAS sequences, the construction and resulting properties of LA and LS families are considered. The conditions an LA family must satisfy are codified here, and algorithms which can be used to construct LA families with given parameters are presented. The construction of LS sequences is considered, and relationship between each of the parameters used in this construction and the properties of the final family is examined. Using this expanded understanding of both these sequence families, a far wider range of LAS families, potentially applicable to a wider range of applications, can be considered. Initially, the merits of proposed sequences are considered primarily through their correlation properties. Both maximum and mean squared correlation values are considered, depending on the context. In order to demonstrate their practical applicability, combination Oppermann, modified UCHT and LAS sequences are employed in a simulated communications system, and the resulting bit error rates are examined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital communications</field><field name="subject">Spread spectrum communications</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Sequence design</field><field name="subject">Interference free window</field><field name="subject">Spread spectrum communications</field><field name="subject">Combination sequences</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering solutions to water quality problems in lakes</field><field name="creator">Morillo, Sebastian</field><field name="description">Lake restoration and management strategies focus on reducing the negative impacts of enriched or polluted inflows. These strategies become of paramount importance when lakes are used for recreational and/or drinking water purposes. Long term control of eutrophication and turbidity problems associated with large inflow loads is usually oriented to catchment management. Although it has been suggested that this is the correct long term approach, public concerns usually require a short term solution. In addition, due to political and economic costs related to changes in catchment management, in-lake restoration technologies have been emerging as a viable pretreatment option, complementary to water treatment plants, both reducing the operational costs of the water treatment plant and ameliorating the water residing in the lakes. This research investigates the effects of two in-lake technologies on the dynamics of inflowing rivers, where basin shape plays a significant role. The three lakes in this study suffer from eutrophication combined with a distinctive water quality problem: from turbidity in Silvan Reservoir (Australia), to heavy metal loads in Coeur d'Alene Lake (USA) and industrial wastes in Lake Como (Italy). Firstly, the influence of basin morphology, wind speed, and wind direction on the fate and transport of two rivers flowing into the L-shaped Coeur d'Alene Lake was examined, and it was shown that transport and mixing patterns in a lake can be greatly influenced by the shape of the lake, leading to important consequences for the plankton ecology in the lake. Secondly, in Silvan Reservoir we investigated the potential to modify the basin shape using vertical barriers, increasing the retention time and hence the barrier capacity to microbial pollution. A final in-lake technology was tested for Lake Como, using a downward pointing impeller to remove polluted water from the coastal margin. Lessons from these three examples indicate that there is significant potential for in-lake remediation at relatively low cost, over relatively short timescales.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eutrophication</field><field name="subject">Lake restoration</field><field name="subject">Lakes -- Management</field><field name="subject">Reservoirs -- Management</field><field name="subject">Water quality management</field><field name="subject">Lakes and reservoirs</field><field name="subject">Residence time and flushing</field><field name="subject">Transport of nutrients, heavy metals, and contaminants</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neurophysiologically mediated auditory processing insensitivity in children with specific language impairment : behavioural discrimination and the mismatch and late discriminative negativities</field><field name="creator">Mengler, Elise Dione</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Some children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) show poor performance on behavioural tasks designed to measure rapid auditory processing, such as the Repetition Test developed by Tallal and colleagues. Stemming from concerns about whether this task reflects higher-order, cognitive variables, this thesis sought to determine whether the performance deficits SLI children show were evident at the neurophysiological level, with minimal cognitive influences, such as attention, using paradigms designed to elicit the mismatch negativity (MMN) and late discriminative negativity (LDN). In the first two studies, a MMN paradigm, equivalent to the Repetition Test, was trialled with a group of 8 adults. In this paired paradigm, the second tone of a pair of pure tones ascending in frequency ('low'-'high') was occasionally replaced with a 'low' tone. The aim was to determine a 'long' and 'short' intra-pair interval (IPI) with which MMN was generated utilizing this paradigm and that were congruent with the Repetition Test findings (i.e., a long IPI at which SLI were able to perform the task, and a short IPI at which SLI children's performance was selectively impaired). In Study One, MMN to a within-pair frequency change was generated with the 30 ms IPI, but not the 700 ms IPI. The grouping parameters of the temporal window of integration (TWI) and temporal distinctiveness were considered less than optimal for the grouping of the pairs presented at 700 ms IPI for the pre-attentive system to register the within-pair frequency change. ... The frequency difference limens (DLs) of the SLI group were significantly higher than a group of 18 normally developing age- and intelligence-matched peers, but there was no significant difference between the groups in their performance on a control intensity discrimination task. The iii SLI group also showed poorer reading skills, yet frequency discrimination was related to oral language ability only. In the final study, MMN was measured to examine the pre-attentive neurophysiological basis of the SLI group's frequency discrimination deficit. Two frequency deviants that were just above each group's 75% DL on the frequency discrimination task were employed in a simple frequency change paradigm: 40 Hz difference for the control group, and 80 Hz difference for the SLI group. MMN and LDN were elicited in the group of 15 normally developing children to their 40 Hz suprathreshold frequency difference and to the 80 Hz difference. A significant MMN was not observed in the group of 13 SLI children to the 40 Hz difference, which was below their threshold level. However, despite discrimination at the behavioural level, MMN did not reach significance in the SLI group to their 80 Hz suprathreshold frequency difference, yet LDN was observed. MMN was larger in both groups for the 80 Hz difference. Furthermore, MMN and LDN amplitude to the suprathreshold deviants were predictive of both frequency and intensity DLs. These results suggested that SLI children have a pre-attentive neurophysiologically mediated insensitivity to small frequency differences, and that MMN (and LDN) to suprathreshold frequency deviants is a sensitive indicator of group discrimination differences and brain-behaviour relationships in children with and without SLI.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language disorders in children -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Cognition in children</field><field name="subject">Specific language impairment</field><field name="subject">Mismatch negativity</field><field name="subject">Late discriminative negativity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian investor relations practices</field><field name="creator">Spaseska, Aleksandra</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Investor relations (IR) management encompasses a broad range of activities including voluntary disclosure, attracting analyst coverage, targeting investors, and providing feedback to corporate managers (Byrd, Goulet, Johnson and Johnson 1993; Brennan and Tamarowski 2000; Bushee and Miller 2005). In recent years, a number of high profile corporate collapses and concerns about selective disclosure have contributed to an increased awareness of the importance of effective IR practices in promoting investor confidence. To this end, Australian market regulators and industry bodies have developed a number of best practice guidelines relating to disclosure and corporate governance. The current study undertakes a comprehensive investigation of corporate approaches to IR in the Australian context, and seeks to explain cross-sectional variation in these. The sample utilised in this study comprises 129 All Ordinaries Index (AOI) constituent companies that responded to a mail survey conducted in 2006 regarding their IR practices. The survey of all AOI companies constitutes the first Australian academic survey of IR practices, and the views of the individuals responsible for the function. Self-reported data are combined with data collected from the sample entities' websites to provide a detailed overview of corporate IR programs. The results of the survey suggest that there is widespread recognition, within the sample, of the importance of devoting organisational resources to IR. ... Several proxies for the extent of investment in IR are developed in this study. Two proxies capture organisational arrangements for managing IR, one proxy captures the frequency of one-to-one meetings with analysts and investors, and one proxy captures the quality of IR websites. Multivariate analyses relate cross-sectional variation in these to a number of firm-specific variables. Consistent with findings presented in the empirical voluntary disclosure literature, this study shows that the extent of investment in IR is positively associated with firm size, a finding that is common across all IR proxies. Ownership characteristics play an important role in explaining different types of investment in IR, as captured by the four proxies. Ownership concentration is negatively associated with the likelihood of employing an external IR consultant and positively associated with the frequency with which one-to-one meetings are held with analysts and investors. Firms with a foreign stock exchange listing, a proxy for the importance of foreign investors, achieve higher scores for the quality of their IR websites. Adverse selection models of voluntary disclosure predict that firms with good news are likely to disclose more. In contrast, the results of this study show that less profitable firms and firms with lower price-to-book ratios are more likely to have an IR department/officer, and they achieve higher scores for the quality of their IR websites. Finally, the nature of the investment in IR appears to differ with sector membership. Firms in the Materials and Energy sectors held more one-to-one meetings than firms in other sectors, while firms in the Information Technology sector are more likely to have an IR department or IR officer, and have higher quality IR websites than firms in other sectors.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations -- Investor relations -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Investor relations</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On a posteriori probability decoding of linear block codes over discrete channels</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, Wayne Bradley</field><field name="description">One of the facets of the mobile or wireless environment is that errors quite often occur in bursts. Thus, strong codes are required to provide protection against such errors. This in turn motivates the employment of decoding algorithms which are simple to implement, yet are still able to attempt to take the dependence or memory of the channel model into account in order to give optimal decoding estimates. Furthermore, such algorithms should be able to be applied for a variety of channel models and signalling alphabets. The research presented within this thesis describes a number of algorithms which can be used with linear block codes. Given the received word, these algorithms determine the symbol which was most likely transmitted, on a symbol-by-symbol basis. Due to their relative simplicity, a collection of algorithms for memoryless channels is reported first. This is done to establish the general style and principles of the overall collection. The concept of matrix diagonalisation may or may not be applied, resulting in two different types of procedure. Ultimately, it is shown that the choice between them should be motivated by whether storage space or computational complexity has the higher priority. As with all other procedures explained herein, the derivation is first performed for a binary signalling alphabet and then extended to fields of prime order. These procedures form the paradigm for algorithms used in conjunction with finite state channel models, where errors generally occur in bursts. In such cases, the necessary information is stored in matrices rather than as scalars. Finally, by analogy with the weight polynomials of a code and its dual as characterised by the MacWilliams identities, new procedures are developed for particular types of Gilbert-Elliott channel models. Here, the calculations are derived from three parameters which profile the occurrence of errors in those models. The decoding is then carried out using polynomial evaluation rather than matrix multiplication. Complementing this theory are several examples detailing the steps required to perform the decoding, as well as a collection of simulation results demonstrating the practical value of these algorithms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Error-correcting codes (Information theory)</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">A posteriori probability decoding</field><field name="subject">Non-binary codes</field><field name="subject">Discrete memoryless channel</field><field name="subject">Linear block codes</field><field name="subject">Generalised weight polynomials</field><field name="subject">Gilbert-Elliott channel</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Executive functioning and the adaptation to novelty</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Jeffrey</field><field name="description">[Truncated thesis] This thesis is concerned with executive functioning in two different but related ways. The first is as an information processing construct in cognitive psychology. There are many different conceptualisations of the information processing basis of executive functioning but this thesis will pursue the notion that executive functioning is best thought of as adaptation to novelty. In the thesis, this will be operationalised using performance indices (principally reaction time) from a number of information processing tasks. These tasks have typically been used in the literature to index either executive functioning or speed of information processing. Both kinds of tasks are used to tackle the second concern of this thesis, namely, how executive functioning is measured. The data analytic techniques developed in this thesis are based on the hypothesis that executive functioning is the process or processes involved in resolving task novelty and consequently measurement will be enhanced through an analysis of performance changes within tasks as the task changes from novel to familiar. The analysis methods will be based largely on the computation of coefficient of variation of reaction time in successive performance windows across the information processing tasks. An elderly sample was chosen for this thesis because of a history of research that has attempted to determine whether cognitive deficits in the elderly are the consequence of the slowing of information processing speed or to impairment in executive functioning. ... The analysis was driven by the hypothesis that a significant shift in the coefficient of variation would mark a transition from novelty to familiarity in task performance and hence from executive to non-executive phases. Three methods were applied to individual performance curves to determine the point at which for each task this transition occurred. Using criterion measures of variability to separate the task data into two stages, analyses showed, contrary to the hypothesis, that later task performance was more highly associated with executive functioning than in initial task performance. The fourth stage of analysis (Chapter 7) applied confirmatory factor analysis to the newly-formed pre- and post transition data. Evidence was found that the magnitude of the contributions of EF across the pre- and post-criterion phases was stable, failing to support the hypothesis. Finally, structural equation modelling was used to examine how age and intelligence in this elderly sample exerts its influence on task performance and whether EF or IPS was the primary cause of age-related cognitive decline. The results showed that the age and intelligence effects on performance were mediated by the requirement to adapt to novelty. Although there was limited evidence to claim that EF is the primary cause of age-related cognitive decline, ageing effects were only apparent when the participants were adapting to novelty. The thesis concludes that there is some support for the hypothesis that executive functioning is best thought of as the processes underpinning adaptation to novelty. While not a panacea, the analytic techniques developed show promise for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognition in old age</field><field name="subject">Cognition -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Human information processing</field><field name="subject">Congnition -- Age factors</field><field name="subject">Executive functioning</field><field name="subject">Cognitive ageing</field><field name="subject">Novelty adaptation</field><field name="subject">Within-task variability</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Routine and rare genetic connections in corals off northwest Australia and the implications for conservation</field><field name="creator">Underwood, Jim</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The extent to which marine populations are connected by larval dispersal is crucial to their distribution, maintenance and diversity. Thus, for the effective conservation of threatened systems such as coral reefs, understanding patterns of connectivity is essential. However, the biophysical mechanisms that retain or disperse larvae within and among populations are poorly understood. Though the open ocean environment provides the opportunity for long-distance dispersal, if this potential is only rarely realised, recruits produced from afar are unlikely to contribute to the local-scale demography of populations over ecological time frames, but will limit broad-scale genetic diversification over evolutionary time. This thesis explores the extent of genetic and demographic connectivity of two species of reef-building corals over a range of spatial scales among the discontinuous reef systems of northwest Australia. ... Putative source and sink dynamics were not random, but were associated with levels of disturbance and recovery from a recent and catastrophic coral bleaching. When S. hystrix samples from another two offshore systems were included in the analysis, large differences among systems showed that gene flow over hundreds of kilometres is rare over microevolutionary time scales that account for connections over multiple generations. Levels of subdivision over the same spatial scales were markedly lower in the acroporid coral, Acropora tenuis, than in S. hystrix. These results are congruent with expectations based on reproductive mode; in contrast to S. hystrix, which releases brooded larvae that are competent to settle immediately, A. tenuis broadcasts its gametes, and after external fertilisation, the larvae need to develop for several days before they are competent to settle. Despite the differences in levels of broad-scale subdivision, in both species significant differentiation was detected between reefs within systems (&gt;10 km), and between sites within some reefs (&lt; 10 km). These results indicate not only that dispersal between reefs and even some reef patches is restricted, but also that hydrodynamics influence retention of brooded and spawned larvae in similar ways. Further analysis of A. tenuis populations from two coastal systems detected significant differences in genetic diversity among the four major systems of northwest Australia. Additionally, genetic divergence between the coastal and offshore zones was greater than expected by the geographic separation of systems, indicating that connectivity between these zones via transport of A. tenuis larvae on oceanic currents occurs rarely even over microevolutionary time scales. This study has two primary implications for conservation. First, since coastal and offshore reefs of northwest Australia appear to be discrete genetic entities, they have independent evolutionary potential to adapt to local conditions and environmental change. Second, systems, reefs and some reef patches of northwest Australia are demographically independent units. Therefore, designs of coral reserve networks should consider routine dispersal distances of kilometres to a few tens of kilometres.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corals -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Corals -- Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Coral reef management</field><field name="subject">Seriatopora hystrix</field><field name="subject">Acropora tenuis</field><field name="subject">Larvae -- Dispersal</field><field name="subject">Connectivity</field><field name="subject">Marine protected areas</field><field name="subject">Disturbance</field><field name="subject">Recruitment</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antimicrobial plants of Australia have the potential to prevent lactic acidosis in ruminants</field><field name="creator">Hutton, Peter</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Antimicrobial growth promoters are added to feed to prevent lactic acidosis in ruminant animals by selectively inhibiting rumen bacteria that produce lactic acid. However, recently imposed or impending bans on the use of antimicrobial growth promoters in animal production have lead to a critical need to find practical alternatives that are safe for the animal and consumer and that obtain similar production benefits. I investigated bioactive plants of Australia for their potential to prevent lactic acidosis in ruminants. The unifying hypothesis tested was that plants would be identified that selectively inhibit lactic acid-producing bacteria and consequently protect against lactic acidosis. This hypothesis was tested in a three phase process: phase 1, plant selection and collection; phase 2, a three stage protocol for screening plants and essential oils; phase 3, in vivo experiments and chemical fractionation of the most promising plant. I developed an in vitro bioassay that simulated acidosis by adding glucose to rumen fluid in Bellco tubes and incubating for 5 h (Chapter 4). The pH and gas production were used as indicators of acidosis and fermentation activity. I used this bioassay to screen ninety-five plants (dried and ground material from 79 species) and ten essential oils and included a negative control (oaten chaff) and a positive control (virginiamycin). One plant, Eremophila glabra, produced a similar pH (5.63) to the positive control (5.43) although it inhibited gas production to a moderate extent (P &lt; 0.05). ... Seven serrulatane diterpenes were identified to be the major secondary metabolites in E. glabra. The metabolites were screened using a broth dilution and microtitre spectrophotometry method and were selective against S. bovis at between 320 and 1077 [mu]g/ mL. The serrulatanes from E. glabra were probably responsible for the activity against acidosis that I observed in vitro, because they selectively inhibited lactateproducing bacteria. It is also possible that a synergy between serrulatanes and possibly other metabolites are responsible for the activity observed in vitro. The results from my experiments support the role that bioactive plants may have to replace the antibiotics that are added to livestock feed. Australian plants were identified containing compounds that were active against the bacterial processes responsible for ruminant acidosis. To my knowledge this is the first work undertaken to identify bioactive plants of Australia for their potential to prevent acidosis. I developed in vitro screening bioassays that targeted key indicators of acidosis. These bioassays enabled me to identify 5 plants from the 104 screened that could potentially control acidosis. One of these plants in particular, E. glabra, showed a level of activity in vitro that was comparable to antibiotic protection against acidosis. The exciting in vitro results were not demonstrated in vivo but only one dose level of E. glabra was used, which was based on the in vitro work. In contrast to the in vitro system the rumen is a continuous flow system with greater complexity and it is possible that the concentration of E. glabra that I used in vivo was not optimum. This places importance on future dose response experiments to confirm the efficacy of E. glabra in vivo.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acidosis</field><field name="subject">Ruminants -- Feeding and feeds</field><field name="subject">Anti-infective agents</field><field name="subject">Plant bioactive compounds</field><field name="subject">Eremophilia glabra</field><field name="subject">Lactic acid -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Lactic acid -- Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Rumen fermentation</field><field name="subject">Lactic acidosis in ruminants</field><field name="subject">Rumen microbiology</field><field name="subject">Australian bioactive plants</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple-imputation approaches to haplotypic analysis of population-based data with applications to cardiovascular disease</field><field name="creator">McCaskie, Pamela Ann</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis investigates novel methods for the genetic association analysis of haplotype data in samples of unrelated individuals, and applies these methods to the analysis of coronary heart disease and related phenotypes. Determining the inheritance pattern of genetic variants in studies of unrelated individuals can be problematic because family members of the studied individuals are often not available. For the analysis of individual genetic loci, no problem arises because the unit of interest is the observed genotype. When the unit of interest is the linear combination of alleles along one chromosome, inherited together in a haplotype, it is not always possible to determine with certainty the inheritance pattern, and therefore statistical methods to infer these patterns must be adopted. Due to genotypic heterozygosity, mutliple possible haplotype configurations can often resolve an individual's genotype measures at multiple loci. When haplotypes are not known, but are inferred statistically, an element of uncertainty is thus inherent which, if not dealt with appropriately, can result in unreliable estimates of effect sizes in an association setting. The core aim of the research described in this thesis was to develop and implement a general method for haplotype-based association analysis using multiple imputation to appropriately deal with uncertainty haplotype assignment. Regression-based approaches to association analysis provide flexible methods to investigate the influence of a covariate on a response variable, adjusting for the effects of other variables including interaction terms. ... These methods are then applied to models accommodating binary, quantitative, longitudinal and survival data. The performance of the multiple imputation method implemented was assessed using simulated data under a range of haplotypic effect sizes and genetic inheritance patterns. The multiple imputation approach performed better, on average, than ignoring haplotypic uncertainty, and provided estimates that in most cases were similar to those observed when haplotypes were known. The haplotype association methods developed in this thesis were used to investigate the genetic epidemiology of cardiovascular disease, utilising data for the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene (CETP), the hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene and the 15- lipoxygenase (ALOX15) gene on a total of 6,487 individuals from three Western Australian studies. Results of these analyses suggested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the CETP gene were associated with increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). SNPs in the LIPC gene were also associated with increased HDL-C and haplotypes in the ALOX15 gene were associated with risk of carotid plaque among individuals with premature CHD. The research presented in this thesis is both novel and important as it provides methods for the analysis of haplotypic associations with a range of response types, while incorporating information about haplotype uncertainty inherent in populationbased studies. These methods are shown to perform well for a range of simulated and real data situations, and have been written into a statistical analysis package that has been freely released to the research community.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Diseases -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Genetic epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Genetics -- Statistical methods</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Diseases -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Haplotypes</field><field name="subject">Statistical genetics</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What money can't buy : the status of financial evaluation</field><field name="creator">Baker, Ian</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Money -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Friendship</field><field name="subject">Comparison (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Money value</field><field name="subject">Incommensurability</field><field name="subject">Justice</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolutionary implications of polyandry in house mice (Mus domesticus)</field><field name="creator">Firman, Renee C.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Despite the costs associated with mating, females of many taxa solicit multiple mates during a single reproductive event (polyandry). Polyandry is clearly adaptive when females gain direct benefits from males at mating. However, polyandry has also been shown to increase female fitness in the absence of direct benefits. Thus, a number of genetic benefit hypotheses have been developed to account for the origin of this behaviour. Although not mutually exclusive, a distinction lays between genetic benefits that propose defense against reproductive failure (nonadditive genetic effects), and those that propose benefits from intrinsic sire effects (additive genetic effects). Nonadditive genetic benefits of polyandry have been documented in a number of species; by soliciting multiple mates females can avoid inbreeding and other forms of incompatibility between parental genotypes. Polyandry may also increase female reproductive success when genetically superior males have greater success in sperm competition, and produce better quality offspring. An inevitable consequence of polyandry is that sperm from rival males will overlap in the female reproductive tract and compete to fertilise the ova. The outcome of sperm competition is typically determined by bias in sperm use by the females, interactions between parental genotypes, and ejaculate characteristics that provide a fertilisation advantage. Thus, sperm competition is recognised as a persuasive force in the evolution of male reproductive traits. Comparative analyses across species, and competitive mating trials within species have suggested that sperm competition can influence the evolution of testis size and sperm production, and both sperm form and sperm function. ... After six generations of selection I observed phenotypic divergence in litter size - litter size increased in the polyandrous lines but not in the monandrous lines. This result was not attributable to inbreeding depression, or environmental/maternal effects associated with mating regime. Genetic benefits associated with polyandry could account for this result if increased litter size were attributable to increased embryo survival. However, males from the polyandrous lineages were subject to sperm competition, and evolved ejaculates with more sperm, suggesting that evolutionary increases in litter size may in part be due to improved male fertility. Finally, Chapter Five is an investigation of the natural variation in levels of polyandry in the wild, and the potential for sperm competition to drive macroevolutionary changes in male reproductive traits among geographically isolated island populations of house mice. I sampled seven island populations of house mice along the coast of Western Australia and, by genotyping pregnant females and their offspring, determined the frequency of multiply sired litters within each population. I applied the frequency of multiple paternity as an index of the risk of sperm competition, and looked for selective responses in testis size and ejaculate traits. I found that the risk of sperm competition predicted testis size across the seven island populations. However, variation in sperm traits was not explained by the risk of sperm competition. I discuss these results in relation to sperm competition theory, and extrinsic factors that influence ejaculate quality.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polyandry</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Mus domesticus</field><field name="subject">Sperm competition</field><field name="subject">Evolution (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Natural selection</field><field name="subject">Sexual selection in animals</field><field name="subject">Polyandry</field><field name="subject">Postcopulatory sexual selection</field><field name="subject">Mammals</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children at educational risk : the development and validation of an instrument for early identification</field><field name="creator">Glasgow, Kenneth</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The overall aim of the research reported in this thesis was to develop and validate an instrument that would identify young children at educational risk. To achieve this, four separate but interrelated studies were conducted. Study One sought to explore the construct of young children at educational risk from the perspective of school psychologists and teachers through a series of open ended interviews. To this end, four school psychologists in charge of centres for severely disruptive children, and seven psychologists and three teachers involved in alternative education programs for alienated youth were interviewed. The findings of Study One revealed a broad range of factors and issues that contribute to a child being placed at educational risk. Interviewees specifically highlighted the significance of behavioural, learning, social, psychological and family factors which contributed to children's at educational risk status. The findings of Study One were incorporated into Study Two, the overall aim of which was to develop and validate a new instrument for the early identification of children at educational risk. Initially, 152 items were generated from the literature critically reviewed in Chapter Two, existing instrumentation and the Study One interview findings. ... In Study Four the construct validity of the CaERI was investigated by examining whether scores on the instrument differentiated between at educational risk groups of children and a group of not at educational risk children. The total data were first investigated for normality of distribution and returned a Shapiro-Wilk statistic of .99 and a significance level of .069 indicating that the combined data set were normally distributed. The individual CaERI scores for the three individual domains were then investigated and Shapiro-Wilk scores ranging from .96 to .99 and significance levels of .13 to .84, supported the assumption that the data are normally distributed. Significant between groups differences were found on the Behaviour Domain, where LDC children scored significantly lower than the regular class at educational risk and SPER-C children. The regular class at educational risk children also scored significantly lower than the SPER-C children which suggest that in the Behaviour Domain the instrument is sensitive enough to differentiate between the three groups. Significant between group differences were also evident between the LDC and regular class at educational risk and the SPER-C groups, with the LDC children scoring lower than the other two groups in the Social and Psychological Domains. Although the SPER-C group children scored higher than the regular class at educational risk group the difference was not significant. Similarly, a gender comparison of the at educational risk groups showed significant differences between males and females on the Behaviour Domain, however, the differences were not significant on the Social or Psychological Domains. A comparison of 20 not at educational risk students with a matched sample of 20 regular class at educational risk students found significant differences between the v groups on all domains.

In geophysics, ultrasound or electromagnetic waves are normally used to provide the tomographic information. In the geotechnical area, seismic tomography is emerging as a promising technique that can be used to determine the spatial variability of shear wave velocities and hence the small strain stiffness of geomaterials. Although some studies have been undertaken to incorporate seismic measurement into centrifuge modelling, there has been to date no attempt to build a complete seismic tomography facility with high resolution for use in a geotechnical centrifuge. Such a powerful facility can help in better understanding of soil behaviour by providing a complete picture of the spatial variation of the soil property of concern. The main aim of this study was to develop a high-resolution seismic tomography (ST) system for the beam centrifuge at the University of Western Australia (UWA) by which the shear wave velocity and hence maximum shear modulus could be determined anywhere in the centrifuge model. ... This limitation was the requirement to use an a priori model. The exact solutions in the different examples presented in this chapter were known, and they were used as a priori models into the inversion process. However, in practice the exact solution is unknown, and the aim of the tomographic inversion is to obtain a solution that best describes the measured data. Carrying out inversion without using an a priori model can yield an output model that hints at the nature of the model. This output can then be used as the starting point in an iterative process, in which the output from one step is used as an a priori model for reinverting the original data in a subsequent step. In this case, this process slightly improved the output tomogram and decreased the value of root mean squares of travel time residuals (Rrms). An alternative inversion strategy was proposed based on the results obtained in this study. It involves using a searching algorithm. A searching process can be carried out based on the output from the first iteration (without using an a priori model). The search can involve varying the parameters that describe buried anomalies, such as the size of the anomaly, the velocity value in the anomaly, and the location of the anomaly. The aim is to search for the combination of anomaly parameters that minimises the resulting error parameters (mainly Rrmx, but also the average error and the standard deviation of the error). For more subtle cases, such as the velocity model under a footing, where inversion without using an a priori model did not recover the input model, a searching algorithm involving applying perturbations to the exact Boussinesq model can be performed. Not only can the searching procedure involve adding perturbation to the velocity values in the Boussinesq model, but it can also add perturbation to the shape of the velocity distribution below the footing. The searching process can continue until a model that fits the data with a minimum error is found, i.e., minimising Rrms.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seismic tomography</field><field name="subject">Geotechnical centrifuge</field><field name="subject">Bender element</field><field name="subject">Shear wave velocity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0165</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibition, anxiety and the development of auditory hallucinations</field><field name="creator">Paulik, Georgina</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Auditory hallucinations (AHs) are one of the most common symptoms of schizophrenia, and are associated with high levels of distress, functional impairment, and need for care. However, current understanding of the exact causes  and thus treatment  of AHs is still in its infancy. Recently, Badcock and colleagues proposed a cognitive dual-deficit model of AHs, which stipulates that intentional inhibition deficits underlie the intrusive and unintentional nature of AHs, while context memory binding deficits explain the source misattribution (Waters, Badcock, Michie, &amp; Maybery, 2006). While this model seems to best explain the different features of AHs, the precise components of inhibitory control involved, and the evident role of negative affect in the production of AHs, have not been empirically examined. Thus, the first two aims of this thesis were to clarify the critical component(s) of inhibitory control specifically related to AHs, and to examine the relationships between negative affect (chiefly anxiety), AHs and inhibitory control. Finally, AHs are also commonly reported by individuals in the general population, consistent with a continuum approach to AHs. Accordingly, the third aim of this thesis was to investigate whether similar relationships exist between hallucinatory-type experiences, inhibitory processes and negative affect in both hallucination predisposition and schizophrenia. The first study presents the findings from two related investigations of hallucination predisposition. ... However, the study revealed a significant relationship between intentional inhibition and trait anxiety (which was independent of hallucination predisposition) allowing the possibility that more severe or longer lasting changes in anxiety may indeed exacerbate difficulties with intentional inhibition. The final study sought to determine whether the pattern of relationships between AHs, inhibitory impairments and anxiety in schizophrenia are similar to those found in hallucination predisposition. The same three cognitive tasks previously employed (ICIM, B-P, and DI) were administered to schizophrenia (N = 61) and healthy control (N = 34) participants. Schizophrenia participants overall exhibited difficulties intentionally resisting interference from distracting stimuli, however did not have difficulties [intentionally or unintentionally] inhibiting task-irrelevant memory traces. Consistent with the continuum approach, AHs were related only to difficulties with intentional inhibition, and these difficulties existed independently from anxiety (although anxiety was related to intentional inhibition) and were unrelated to other schizophrenia symptoms. Together, the studies support the first component of Badcock et al.'s dual-deficit model of AHs, with hallucinatory experiences in both hallucination predisposition and schizophrenia associated with specific intentional inhibition impairments. The findings also suggest that while anxiety may contribute to the production of AHs by exacerbating v existing intentional inhibition impairments, it is likely that anxiety has additional routes of influence. These findings provide strong support for the continuum approach to AHs. The implications of these findings and possible avenues for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schizofrenia</field><field name="subject">Hallucination predisposition</field><field name="subject">Affect</field><field name="subject">Auditory hallucinations</field><field name="subject">Inhibition</field><field name="subject">Anxiety</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA marker assisted breeding in interspecific crosses to improve canola (Brassica napus L.)</field><field name="creator">Schelfhout, Christopher James</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In order to expand the gene pool of canola-quality rapeseed (Brassica napus) reciprocal interspecific crosses were made between B. napus cv. Mystic and near canola-quality B. juncea breeding line JN29. F1 progeny from these crosses were used to make backcrosses to both parents in all possible combinations and directions, and were selfed to form F2-derived lines. The highest frequencies of viable F2 and BC1 progeny were obtained when B. napus was the maternal parent of the interspecific hybrid. BC1 and F2 progeny (and subsequent generations) were grown under field conditions to identify agronomic improvements over the parents. Transgressive segregation was observed in F2 and BC1 and in subsequent generations for agronomic traits (seed yield under high or low rainfall conditions, plant biomass, harvest index, height, branching and days to anthesis) and seed quality traits (oil, protein, glucosinolates, oleic acid). The majority of progeny conformed to B. napus morphology, and a minority segregated to B. juncea morphology in subsequent generations. Some of the B. juncea morphotypes had lower glucosinolates and higher oleic acid than the parent JN29, with no detectable erucic acid, and thereby conformed to canola quality. Methods were developed for tracing B-genome in interspecific progeny. A repetitive DNA sequence pBNBH35 from B. nigra (genome BB, 2n = 16) was used to identify B-genome chromosomes and introgressions in interspecific progeny. Specific primers were designed for pBNBH35 in order to amplify the repetitive sequence by PCR. A cloned sub-fragment of 329 bp was confirmed by sequencing as part of pBNBH35. PCR and hybridisation techniques were used on an array of Brassica species to confirm that the pBNBH35 subfragment was Brassica B-genome specific. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in B nigra, B. juncea (AABB, 2n=36) and B. napus (AACC, 2n=38) showed that the pBNBH35 sub-fragment was present on all eight Brassica Bgenome chromosomes and absent from A- and C-genome chromosomes. The pBNBH35 repeat was localised to the centromeric region of each B-genome chromosome. FISH clearly distinguished the B-genome chromosomes from the A-genome chromosomes in the amphidiploid species B. juncea. This is the first known report of a B-genome repetitive marker that is present on all Brassica Bgenome chromosomes. ... The results suggest that novel B. napus genotypes have been generated containing introgressions of B-genome chromatin from B. juncea chromosomes. B. juncea morphology occurred in interspecific progeny with a chromosome complement similar to B. napus (2n = 38) and without the entire Bgenome present. It also is highly likely that recombination has occurred between the A-genome of the two Brassica species. This research has demonstrated that the secondary gene pool of B. napus may be accessed by selfing interspecific hybrids, and without sacrificing canola quality, if the B. juncea parent is near canola-quality. Interspecific progeny may be screened to enhance the proportion with B-genome positive signals. Some progeny with B. junceatype morphology had improved seed quality over the JN29 parent.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brassica -- Breeding</field><field name="subject">Crop improvement</field><field name="subject">Rape (Plant)</field><field name="subject">Rape (Plant) -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Wide hybridisation</field><field name="subject">Brassica juncea</field><field name="subject">Oilseed rape</field><field name="subject">Indian mustard</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust speech features for speech recognition in hostile environments</field><field name="creator">Toh, Aik</field><field name="description">Speech recognition systems have improved in robustness in recent years with respect to both speaker and acoustical variability. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to deploy speech recognition systems in real-world applications that are exposed to diverse and significant level of noise. Robustness and recognition accuracy are the essential criteria in determining the extent of a speech recognition system deployed in real-world applications. This work involves development of techniques and extensions to extract robust features from speech and achieve substantial performance in speech recognition. Robustness and recognition accuracy are the top concern in this research. In this work, the robustness issue is approached using the front-end processing, in particular robust feature extraction. The author proposes an unified framework for robust feature and presents a comprehensive evaluation on robustness in speech features. The framework addresses three distinct approaches: robust feature extraction, temporal information inclusion and normalization strategies. The author discusses the issue of robust feature selection primarily in the spectral and cepstral context. Several enhancement and extensions are explored for the purpose of robustness. This includes a computationally efficient approach proposed for moment normalization. In addition, a simple back-end approach is incorporated to improve recognition performance in reverberant environments. Speech features in this work are evaluated in three distinct environments that occur in real-world scenarios. The thesis also discusses the effect of noise on speech features and their parameters. The author has established that statistical properties play an important role in mismatches. The significance of the research is strengthened by the evaluation of robust approaches in more than one scenario and the comparison with the performance of the state-of-the-art features. The contributions and limitations of each robust feature in all three different environments are highlighted. The novelty of the work lies in the diverse hostile environments which speech features are evaluated for robustness. The author has obtained recognition accuracy of more than 98.5% for channel distortion. Recognition accuracy greater than 90.0% has also been maintained for reverberation time 0.4s and additive babble noise at SNR 10dB. The thesis delivers a comprehensive research on robust speech features for speech recognition in hostile environments supported by significant experimental results. Several observations, recommendations and relevant issues associated with robust speech features are presented.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robust speech features</field><field name="subject">Speech recognition</field><field name="subject">Noisy environments</field><field name="subject">Speech processing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformative mappings : testing a methodology for making site-specific architecture in remote biodiverse landscapes</field><field name="creator">Weir, Ian James</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Remote biodiverse sites present unique problems to architects who seek to create greater connectivity between people and landscape. Such sites, particularly those along Australia's temperate coastlines, are rapidly being developed for housing yet in many cases these landscapes have no prior history of sedentary habitation. Not only do these sites lack relevant architectural precedents, they are yet to be measured and represented; the very acts that define the specifics of site and identity of place. These landscapes are as unrecorded as they are uninhabited and consequently there is little to resist the imposition of foreign architectural typologies - buildings which are inherently ecologically unsustainable and non site-specific. This thesis addressed these problems by testing an architectural design methodology which placed considerable emphasis on site measure and mapping. The key hypothesis that underpinned the research was that site-specific architecture cannot be realised independently of site-specific mapping. The research was conducted from the standpoint that maps are not simply abstracted 'grounds' upon which architectural designs are formulated, they are landscape representations and as such they engage with a broader cultural context by articulating our fundamental concepts of 'landscape'. The thesis is part theoretical discourse and part creative research. The research method involved first selecting a number of study sites in a new housing subdivision located within one of the world's most biodiverse regions. ... Several opportunities arose as a direct result of this publicly engaged process, most notably two professional commissions: the first as guest artist for a two-year state-wide exhibition; the second for a built work of architecture in the study area. Both projects provided a 'proof of concept' test of the applicability of the research method to architectural praxis. While the research primarily addresses the discipline of architectural design, it draws upon methods and approaches from landscape architecture, surveying, botany, photography, and art practice. These disciplines all face the same challenge as architecture in remote biodiverse sites: conventional forms of measure, representation and making must be reconceptualised in order to develop responses which are commensurate with the unique biophysical and cultural conditions which characterise these sites. Because biodiverse sites continuously change, as does our understanding of them, a direct causal link between site-specific mapping and site-specific architecture cannot be established. However, the research has shown that collectively such works provide a 'landscape of resistance': through a highly site-attuned multidisciplinary approach, greater connectivity is achieved between people and landscape and the manifestations of this connectivity - the sitespecific maps and buildings - help to form specifically local understandings of landscape. Building in remote biodiverse landscapes is a technical problem, a creative problem, a cultural problem and an ethical problem. The research presents a means of reconciling these problems in the midst of the present milieu, one which is characterised by extreme technical capacity and environmental anxiety.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Landscape</field><field name="subject">Representation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanics of mine backfill</field><field name="creator">Helinski, Mathew</field><field name="description">#DEFAULT</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mine backfill</field><field name="subject">Cementation</field><field name="subject">Consolidation</field><field name="subject">Self desiccation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between dog ownership and physical activity</field><field name="creator">Christian, Hayley Emma</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The Dogs and Physical Activity (DAPA) study sought to examine the relationship between dog ownership and physical activity, in particular walking. It used an ecological model to examine the socio-demographic, intrapersonal, social environmental, physical environmental and policy-related factors affecting dog owners walking with their dog. Results from this study are presented as a series of papers four which are published, in press or accepted for publication. A review of the dog ownership, health and physical activity literature and results from qualitative research of the potential barriers and motivators to dog owners being physically active with their dogs were used to develop and test an instrument for measuring dog walking behaviour. The DAPA tool was designed to measure the amount of physical activity people undertake with their dog and dog-specific individual and environmental factors affecting people walking with their dog. It was developed as a supplementary tool for the second RESIDential Environments (RESIDE) survey. RESIDE is a 5-year longitudinal study of the physical activity levels of people building homes in new housing estates in Western Australia. Findings from the baseline survey of 1813 RESIDE participants (44% dog owners) showed that dog owners were 60% more likely than non-owners to achieve sufficient physical activity and sufficient walking and almost 80% more likely than non-owners to achieve sufficient walking for recreation in the neighbourhood after controlling for demographic, intrapersonal and environmental differences. ... Findings from the DAPA study highlight the importance of the local policy and physical environment in encouraging dog walking behaviour. Perceived lack of accessible public open space (POS) and dogspecific exercise areas were identified by focus group participants as major barriers to dog owners walking with their dog. Objective measurement of the local physical environment of dog owners supported their concerns; no dog owners in this study had access to a sign-posted off-leash park [greater than or equal to] 2 acres within their neighbourhood. Furthermore, access to local POS with dog-supportive infrastructure was associated with being a regular dog walker. Overall, the results of this study draw attention to the needs of dog owners in the allocation and design of POS. The prospective component of the DAPA study enabled examination of the causal relationship between dog ownership and physical activity. After adjusting for baseline variables, dog acquisition significantly increased minutes of recreational walking within the neighbourhood by 37 minutes. However, after further adjustment for changes in baseline variables, the increase in minutes of recreational walking within the neighbourhood from dog acquisition reduced to 21 minutes and was no longer statistically significant. Increase in intention to walk appeared to mediate the relationship between dog acquisition and increased recreational walking. This study highlights a number of important physical activity benefits associated with dog ownership and provides evidence to suggest that dog walking has the potential to positively affect the proportion of the community who are sufficiently active.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Dog owners</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Dog ownership</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gully erosion on rehabilitated bauxite mines</field><field name="creator">Mengler, Faron</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Landforms rehabilitated after bauxite mining can be vulnerable to soil loss by water erosion processes. On most rehabilitated sites, management controls such as deep ripping, contour mounding and landscaped sub-catchments limit erosion. Despite these measures, severe gully erosion that is anecdotally associated with steep slopes can damage rehabilitated areas and affect downstream drinking water resources. A review of erosion dynamics reveals that gullies develop episodically and in a non-linear manner. They often initiated as a near surface process and are influenced by natural climatic drivers. Despite this, local site characteristics including soil and landform can predispose an area to gully erosion. Moreover, erosion models, becoming more-widely utilized within the mining industry, may provide useful tools with which to measure, analyse, and manage gully erosion. One of these models, SIBERIA was tested to determine its suitability for application a tool to help manage erosion risk. We first surveyed 26 eroding and erosion-prone rehabilitated hillslopes to determine the common form and setting for gully erosion on these rehabilitated bauxite mines. A conceptual model was developed to include and explore the interplay between the common causes of the gullies surveyed. The conceptual model accounts for slope steepness but suggests that additionally, certain triggers and threshold effects operating under different site conditions are as influential (or even more influential) than slope steepness as determinants of gully erosion occurrence and severity. ... Soil properties and soil erodibility had some subtle influence on landform stability and erosion risk. The most-erodible media occurred where either: mine floor material was mixed with topsoil/ overburden; and/or the topsoil/overburden layer was thin or its coverage is patchy resulting in slaking subsoil, hardsetting soil and surface crusts. When erodible surface media were combined with steeper (&gt;8[degrees]) or longer (&gt;50 m) slopes or with any major erosion trigger, rill and gully development was greatly intensified. The SIBERIA simulation model was calibrated and its simulated outputs were compared to known locations of gully erosion on a steep, rehabilitated pit from the Willowdale mine. At a resolution of one metre, SIBERIA was able to simulate the approximate dimensions of gullies. However, SIBERIA could not simulate the exact location of individual gully headcuts. Additionally, SIBERA was able to simulate the effect of different microtopographic surface treatments but this was only achieved by increasing the grid resolution to 25 cm and reducing the size of the area simulated due to model constraints. Locations of gully headcuts were overlain onto a grid-based, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using a Geographic Information System (GIS). The spatial distribution of gully headcut locations was compared to DEM derivatives such as slope and flow accumulation. Positive, and predictive relationships allow between the steepness of the slope of the pre-mining landform and the cell count of the area contributing to flow (catchment), as determined by GIS, may allow a mine scale indication of erosion risk using simple GIS desktop analysis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil erosion -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Aluminum mines and mining</field><field name="subject">Abandoned mined lands reclamation -- Western Australia -- Darling Range</field><field name="subject">Landscape</field><field name="subject">Bauxite mine</field><field name="subject">Erosion mapping</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origin-centric techniques for optimising scalability and the fidelity of motion, interaction and rendering</field><field name="creator">Thorne, Chris</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This research addresses endemic problems in the fields of computer graphics and simulation such as jittery motion, spatial scalability, rendering problems such as z-buffer tearing, the repeatability of physics dynamics and numerical error in positional systems. Designers of simulation and computer graphics software tend to map real world navigation rules onto the virtual world, expecting to see equivalent virtual behaviour. After all, if computers are programmed to simulate the real world, it is reasonable to expect the virtual behaviour to correspond. However, in computer simulation many behaviours and other computations show measurable problems inconsistent with realworld experience, particularly at large distances from the virtual world origin. Many of these problems, particularly in rendering, can be imperceptible, so users may be oblivious to them, but they are measurable using experimental methods. These effects, generically termed spatial jitter in this thesis, are found in this study to stem from floating point error in positional parameters such as spatial coordinates. This simulation error increases with distance from the coordinate origin and as the simulation progresses through the pipeline. The most common form of simulation error relevant to this study is spatial error which is found by this thesis to not be calculated, as may be expected, using numerical relative error propagation rules but using the rules of geometry. ... The thesis shows that the thinking behind real-world rules, such as for navigation, has to change in order to properly design for optimal fidelity simulation. Origincentric techniques, formulae, terms, architecture and processes are all presented as one holistic solution in the form of an optimised simulation pipeline. The results of analysis, experiments and case studies are used to derive a formula for relative spatial error that accounts for potential pathological cases. A formula for spatial error propagation is then derived by using the new knowledge of spatial error to extend numerical relative error propagation mathematics. Finally, analytical results are developed to provide a general mathematical expression for maximum simulation error and how it varies with distance from the origin and the number of mathematical operations performed. We conclude that the origin centric approach provides a general and optimal solution to spatial jitter. Along with changing the way one thinks about navigation, process guidelines and formulae developed in the study, the approach provides a new paradigm for positional computing. This paradigm can improve many aspects of computer simulation in areas such as entertainment, visualisation for education, industry, science, or training. Examples are: spatial scalability, the accuracy of motion, interaction and rendering; and the consistency and predictability of numerical computation in physics. This research also affords potential cost benefits through simplification of software design and code. These cost benefits come from some core techniques for minimising position dependent error, error propagation and also the simplifications and from new algorithms that flow naturally out of the core solution.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Floating point</field><field name="subject">Precision</field><field name="subject">Spatial jitter</field><field name="subject">Rendering</field><field name="subject">3D graphics</field><field name="subject">Computation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Curriculum contestation : analysis of contemporary curriculum policy and practices in government and non-government education sectors in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, Joanne</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The aim of this study was to analyse the changing dynamics within and between government and non-government education sectors in relation to the Curriculum Framework (CF) policy in Western Australia (WA) from 1995 to 2004. The Curriculum Council was established by an act of State Parliament in 1997 to oversee the development and enactment of the CF, which was released in 1998. A stated aim of the CF policy was to unify the education sectors through a shared curriculum. The WA State government mandated that all schools, both government and non-government, demonstrate compliance by 2004. This was the first time that curriculum was mandated for non-government schools, therefore the dynamics within and between the education sectors were in an accelerated state of transformation in the period of study. The timeframe for the research represented the period from policy inception (1995) to the deadline for policy enactment for Kindergarten to Year 10 (2004). However, given the continually evolving and increasingly politicised nature of curriculum policy processes in WA, this thesis also provides an extended analysis of policy changes to the time of thesis submission in 2007 when the abolition of the Curriculum Council was formally announced - a decade after it was established. ... The research reported in this thesis draws on both critical theory and post-structuralist approaches to policy analysis within a broader framework of policy network theory. Policy network theory is used to bring the macro focus of critical theory and the micro focus of post-structuralism together in order to highlight power issues at all levels of the policy trajectory. Power dynamics within a policy network are fluid and multidimensional, and power struggles are characteristic at all levels. This study revealed significant power differentials between government and non-government education sectors caused by structural and cultural differences. Differences in autonomy between the education sectors meant that those policy actors within the non-government sector were more empowered to navigate the competing and conflicting forms of accountabilities that emerged from the changes to WA curriculum policy. Despite both generalised discourses of blurring public/private boundaries within the context of neoliberal globalisation and specific CF goals of bringing the sectors together, the boundaries continue to exist. Further, there is much strategising about how to remain distinct within the context of increased market choice. This study makes a unique and significant contribution to the understanding of policy processes surrounding the development and enactment of the CF in WA and the implications for the changing dynamics within and between the education sectors. Emergent themes and findings may potentially be used as a basis for contrast and comparison in other contexts. The research contributes to policy theory by arguing for closer attention to be paid to power dynamics between localised agency in particular policy spaces and the state-imposed constraints.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Competency based education -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Education and state -- Australia -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Curriculum framework</field><field name="subject">Outcomes based education</field><field name="subject">Public and private schooling</field><field name="subject">Policy sociology</field><field name="subject">Market choice</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complementary investigations of the molecular biology of cancer : assessment of the role of Grb7 in the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells; and prediction and validation of microRNA targets involved in cancer</field><field name="creator">Webster, Rebecca</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] For this thesis, the molecular biology of cancer was approached from two directions. Firstly, an investigation was conducted on the role of growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (Grb7) in breast cancer. Grb7 is an adapter molecule that binds to a variety of proteins, including the growth factor receptor and proto-oncogene, ErbB2, and mediates signalling to downstream pathways. It has been linked to cell migration and an invasive phenotype, and is of interest as a therapeutic target. To investigate the role of Grb7 in breast cancer, preliminary experiments were performed that, firstly, determined the expression of wild-type Grb7 and a splice variant, Grb7V, in a range of cell lines, and secondly, aided the development of a protocol for treating cells with short interfering RNA (siRNA) against Grb7 and the ErbB ligand, heregulin (HRG), in a cell system appropriate for measuring the functional outcomes. Using this protocol in conjunction with CellTitre (CT) proliferation assays, it was demonstrated that Grb7 does not play a role in the proliferation of either unstimulated or HRG-stimulated SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, using the protocol in conjunction with Boyden chamber migration assays, it was shown that inhibition of Grb7 expression has a slight stimulatory effect on HRG-stimulated SK-BR-3 cell migration. Thus, Grb7 was found to play only a minor role in the migration of SK-BR-3 cells, suggesting that it is not an ideal anti-cancer target for breast cancers modelled by this cell system. Concurrently, a second investigation was conducted, which similarly sought insight into the molecular biology of cancer, but adopted a more strategic approach. ... These results provide evidence for a biologically significant role for the miR-7-mediated regulation of EGFR expression. A microarray experiment was also performed to identify genes that were down-regulated following treatment with miR-7 compared to NS precursor. Of 248 down-regulated genes, including EGFR, 37 promising new miR-7 target candidates were identified. Functional clustering of down-regulated genes and promising target candidates suggested that miR-7 may have functionally-related targets involved in processes including cell motility and brain-associated functions. This investigation thus yielded a program capable of accurately predicting a miRNA target not predicted by any other target prediction program, verified a previously unknown miRNA:target interaction with functional consequences in cancer cells and provided the first steps towards investigating miR-7-mediated regulation in greater depth. Furthermore, EGFR was, to our knowledge, the first example of a verified miRNA target with target sites that are not conserved across mammals, an observation with important implications for computational target prediction and the evolution of miRNA regulatory systems. In addition, the demonstrated growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of miR-7 on lung cancer cells raise the possibility of a miR-7-based therapeutic for the treatment of EGFR-overexpressing tumours.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer</field><field name="subject">Lungs -- Cancer</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Growth factors</field><field name="subject">Lectins</field><field name="subject">Cancer cells -- Proliferation</field><field name="subject">Cancer cells -- Motility</field><field name="subject">MicroRNA</field><field name="subject">EGFR</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linking seafloor mapping and ecological models to improve classification of marine habitats : opportunities and lessons learnt in the Recherche Archipelago, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Baxter, Katrina</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Spatially explicit marine habitat data is required for effective resource planning and management across large areas, although mapped boundaries typically lack rigour in explaining what factors influence habitat distributions. Accurate, quantitative methods are needed. In this thesis I aimed to assess the utility of ecological models to determine what factors limit the spatial extent of marine habitats. I assessed what types of modeling methods were able to produce the most accurate predictions and what influenced model results. To achieve this, initially a broad scale marine habitat survey was undertaken in the Recherche Archipelago, on the south coast of Western Australia using video and sidescan sonar. Broad and more detailed functional habitats types were mapped for 1054km2 of the Archipelago. Broad habitats included high and low profile reefs, sand, seagrass and extensive rhodolith beds, although considerable variation could be identified from video within these broad types. Different densities of seagrass were identified and reefs were dominated by macroalgae, filter feeder communities, or a combination of both. Geophysical characteristics (depth, substrate, relief) and dominant benthic biota were recorded and then modelled using decision trees and a combination of generalised additive models (GAMs) and generalised linear models (GLMs) to determine the factors influencing broad and functional habitat variation. Models were developed for the entire Archipelago (n=2769) and a subset of data in Esperance Bay (n=797), which included exposure to wave conditions (mean maximum wave height and mean maximum shear stress) calculated from oceanographic models. Additional distance variables from the mainland and islands were also derived and used as model inputs for both datasets. Model performance varied across habitats, with no one method better than the other in terms of overall model accuracy for each habitat type, although prevalent classes (&gt;20%) such as high profile reefs with macroalgae and dense seagrass were the most reliable (Area Under the Curve &gt;0.7). ... This highlighted not only issues of data prevalence, but also how ecological models can be used to test the reliability of classification schemes. Care should be taken when mapping predicted habitat occurrence with broad habitat models. It should not be assumed that all habitats within the type will be defined spatially, as this may result in the distribution of distinctive and unique habitats such as filterfeeders being underestimated or not identified at all. More data is needed to improve prediction of these habitats. Despite the limitations identified, the results provide direction for future field sampling to ensure appropriate variables are sampled and classification schemes are carefully designed to improve descriptions of habitat distributions. Reliable habitat models that make ecological sense will assist future assessments of biodiversity within habitats as well as provide improved data on the probability of habitat occurrence. This data and the methods developed will be a valuable resource for reserve selection models that prioritise sites for management and planning of marine protected areas.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquatic habitats</field><field name="subject">Ocean bottom -- Remote-sensing maps</field><field name="subject">Marine habitats</field><field name="subject">Predictive modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An in vitro and in vitro study on the role of the glycoprotein fibulin-3 in olfactory nerve growth and repair</field><field name="creator">Vukovic, Jana</field><field name="description">The primary olfactory pathway in adult mammals has retained a remarkable potential for self-repair. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), specialized glial cells within the olfactory nerve, are thought to play an important role in the ongoing growth and replenishment of sensory connections in this system. To gain insight into novel molecules that could mediate OEC-supported growth of axons within the olfactory nerve, gene expression profiling experiments revealed very high expression of the fibulin-3 glycoprotein in OECs. To date, research on fibulin-3 has been limited and mainly focused on its involvement in Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy, vasculogenesis and tumor formation. As the extracellular matrix associated with OECs is thought to be an important contributor to a growth-permissive environment, the main aim of this thesis was to define a putative role for fibulin-3 during olfactory receptor neuron replacement and regeneration. This hypothesis was investigated in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments that involved lentiviral vectors to manipulate fibulin-3 gene expression in OECs as well as the use of knock-out mice. Using genetically-modified OECs, experimental data showed that increased levels of fibulin-3 induced morphological changes in OECs and also impeded their migration. Lentiviral vector-mediated expression of fibulin-3 in OECs also had an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion explants. On the other hand, knock-down of fibulin-3 levels via siRNA technology resulted in reduced proliferation. Comparative lesioning experiments in fibulin-3 knock-out and wild-type mice allowed for further assessment of a role for fibulin-3 in olfactory nerve repair in vivo. Two experimental injury models, i.e. epithelial (Triton-X) lesioning and olfactory bulbectomy, were employed. The results obtained were in line with in vitro observations. A lack of fibulin-3 in knock-out mice resulted in a seemingly augmented regeneration of the olfactory epithelium at 10 days post-injury. However, at the latest recovery time point of 42 days post-injury, an impaired recovery of the olfactory epithelium from the experimental insults was observed. Although the precise mechanism for the latter phenomenon is not yet fully understood, our data point towards several factors which include vascular abnormalities and altered cell proliferation within the olfactory epithelium. Additionally, the precise protein distribution of another wide-spread family of extracellular matrix molecules, the laminins, was investigated in this thesis. It was of interest to investigate the spatiotemporal expression of laminin isoforms during iii olfactory nerve development and regeneration as these molecules may have distinct roles in promoting olfactory sensory neuron growth and patterning. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies concluded that laminin-211 and laminin-411 were the most likely candidates to play such a role. In summary, this thesis provides new insights into the role of the extracellular matrix, fibulin-3 in particular, in regulating cell migration, division and axonal growth in the primary olfactory pathway. Such knowledge also gives a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which OEC transplants may enhance axonal regeneration elsewhere in the CNS.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extracellular matrix</field><field name="subject">Olfactory nerve -- Regeneration</field><field name="subject">Olfactory system</field><field name="subject">Olfactory ensheathing cells</field><field name="subject">Fibulin-3</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technologies of power : discipline of Aboriginal students in primary school</field><field name="creator">Gillan, Kevin P.</field><field name="description">This study explored how the discursive practices of government education systemic discipline policy shape the behaviour of Aboriginal primary school students in an urban education district in Western Australia. First, this study conducted a Foucauldian genealogical discourse analysis of the historical and contemporary discursive forces that shaped systemic discipline policy in Western Australian government schools between 1983 and 1998 to uncover changing discursive practices within the institution. This period represented a most turbulent era of systemic discipline policy development within the institution. The analysis of the historical and contemporary discursive forces that shaped policy during this period revealed nine major and consistent discursive practices. Secondly, the study conducted a Foucauldian genealogical discourse analysis into the perspectives of key interest groups of students, parents and Education Department employees in an urban Aboriginal community on discipline policy in Education Department primary schools during the period from 2000 to 2001; and the influence of these policies on the behaviour of Aboriginal students in primary schools. The analysis was accomplished using Foucault's method of genealogy through a tactical use of subjugated knowledges. A cross section of the Aboriginal community was interviewed to examine issues of consultation, suspension and exclusion, institutional organisation and discourse. The study revealed that there are minimal consistent conceptual underpinnings to the development of Education Department discipline policy between 1983 and 1998. What is clear through the nine discursive practices that emerged during the first part of the study is a strengthened recentralising pattern of regulation, in response to the influence of a neo-liberal doctrine that commodifies students in a network of accountability mechanisms driven by the market-state economy. Evidence from both genealogical analyses in this study confirms that the increasing psychologisation of the classroom is contributing towards the pathologisation of Aboriginal student behaviour. It is apparent from the findings in this study that Aboriginal students regularly display Aboriginality-as-resistance type behaviours in response to school discipline regimes. The daily tension for these students at school is the maintenance of their Aboriginality in the face of school policy that disregards many of their regular cultural and behavioural practices, or regimes of truth, that are socially acceptable at home and in their community but threaten the 'good order' of the institution when brought to school. This study found that teachers and principals are ensnared in a web of governmentality with their ability to manoeuvre within the constraints of systemic discipline policy extremely limited. The consequence of this web of governmentality is that those doing the governing in the school are simultaneously the prisoner and the gaoler, and in effect the principle of their own subjection. Also revealed were the obscure and dividing discursive practices of discipline regimes that contribute to the epistemic violence enacted upon Noongar students in primary schools through technologies of power.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Education -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Education and state -- Australia -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Primary school teaching -- Australia -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal education</field><field name="subject">Discipline policy</field><field name="subject">Foucauldian discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Primary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Location-free node scheduling schemes for energy efficient, fault tolerant and adaptive sensing in wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Pazand, Babak</field><field name="description">Node scheduling is one of the most effective techniques to maximize the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. It is the process of selecting a subset of nodes to monitor the sensor field on behalf of redundant nodes. At every round of the scheduling a small group of nodes are active while the rest of the sensor nodes are in sleep mode. In this thesis, we propose a novel node scheduling solution for wireless sensor networks. The main characteristic of our approach is its independence from location information as well as distance information. Moreover, it does not rely on unrealistic circular radio propagation models. In order to have a comprehensive solution, we have considered different relations between sensing range and transmission range. When these ranges are equal in addition to the case that transmission range is higher than sensing range, we devise a node scheduling scheme based on the concept of Minimum Dominating Set. Two heuristics are presented to determine a collection of minimum dominating sets of the graph of the wireless sensor network. At each round of the scheduling only one set is active. Minimum dominating sets are scheduled to be rotated periodically. Moreover, every set is synchronized prior to the end of its active period in order to minimize the effect of clock drift of sensor nodes. Two components are considered to address node failures during the on-duty period of minimum dominating sets. These are probing environment and adaptive sleeping. The former is responsible for probing the working nodes of the active set to detect any node failure. The latter adjusts the frequency of probing for minimizing the overhead of probing while preserving an adequate level of robustness for discovery of node failure. This framework is based on the PEAS protocol that has been developed by Fan Ye et al. [98, 99]. We propose a different node scheduling scheme with a three-tier architecture for the case that sensing range is higher than transmission range. The coverage tier includes a set of nodes to monitor the region of the interest. We propose a heuristic to determine a collection of d-dominating sets of the graph of the wireless sensor network. At every round of the scheduling one d-dominating set forms the coverage tier. Connectivity tier consists of sensor nodes that relay the data collected at the coverage tier back to the base station. Finally, the coverage management tier is responsible for managing different patterns of coverage such as cyclic or uniform coverage.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sensor networks</field><field name="subject">Wireless LANs</field><field name="subject">Node scheduling</field><field name="subject">Coverage problem</field><field name="subject">Adaptive sensing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Afterlife, but not as we know it : medicine, technology and the body resurrected</field><field name="creator">Lizama, Natalia</field><field name="description">This thesis contends that technologically-derived resurrections of human bodies and bodily fragments can be viewed as indicative of a 'post-biological' ontology. Drawing from examples in which human bodies are resurrected, both figuratively and actually, this thesis puts forward the term 'post-biological subject' as an ideological framework for conceptualising the reconfiguration of human ontology that results from various medical technologies that 'resurrect' the human body. In this instance, the term 'postbiological', borrowed from Hans Moravec who uses it denote a future in which human being is radically disembodied and resurrected within a digital realm, is used somewhat ironically: where Moravec imagines an afterlife in which the body is discarded as so much 'meat', the post-biological afterlife of the body in this thesis centres around a form of corporeal resurrection. Corpses, living organs and excreta may all be resurrected, some of them in digital format, yet this kind of resurrection departs radically from the disembodied spiritual bliss imagined in many conceptualisations of resurrection. The post-biological subject resists ontological delineation and problematises boundaries defining self and other, living and dead, and human and nonhuman and is fraught with a number of cultural anxieties about its unique ontological status. These concerns are analysed in the context of a number of phenomena, including melancholy, horror, monstrosity and the uncanny, all of which similarly indicate an anxious fixation with human ontology. The purpose of discussing post-biological bodies in relation to phenomena such as melancholy or the uncanny is not to reinstate as ideological frameworks the psychoanalytic models from which these concepts are derived, but rather to use them as starting points for more complex analyses of postbiological ontology. The first and second chapters of this thesis discuss instances in which the human body is posthumously modified, drawing on Gunther von Hagens's Body Worlds exhibition and the Visible Human Project. The Body Worlds plastinates are situated in a liminal and ambiguous ontological space between life and death, and it is argued that their extraordinary ontological status evokes a form of imagined melancholy, wherein the longed-for and lost melancholic object is a complete process of death. In the case of the Visible Human Project, it is argued that the gruesome and highly technologised process of creating the Visible Male, wherein the corpse is effectively dehumanised and iv rendered geometric, evokes the trope of horror, while at the same time being fraught with a nostalgic longing for a pre-technological, anatomically 'authentic' body. The third and fourth chapters of this thesis discuss instances in which the living human body is reconfigured, focusing on immortal cell lines and organ transplantation, and on medical imaging technologies such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. In the third chapter it is argued that organ transplantation and the creation of immortal cell lines give rise to profound anxieties about ontological contamination through their capacity to render permeable the imagined boundaries defining self, and in this way invoke the monstrous. The fourth chapter interrogates the representation of medical imaging in Don DeLillo?s novel White Noise, arguing that the medical representation of the body functions as a form of double, a digital doppelganger that elicits an uncanny anxiety through its capacity to presage death.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resurrection</field><field name="subject">Humanism -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Body, Human (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Organ transplantation</field><field name="subject">Posthumanism</field><field name="subject">The Visible Human Project</field><field name="subject">Body Worlds</field><field name="subject">HeLa cell line</field><field name="subject">Resurrection</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptual features for speech recognition</field><field name="creator">Haque, Serajul</field><field name="description">Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is one of the most important research areas in the field of speech technology and research. It is also known as the recognition of speech by a machine or, by some artificial intelligence. However, in spite of focused research in this field for the past several decades, robust speech recognition with high reliability has not been achieved as it degrades in presence of speaker variabilities, channel mismatch condi- tions, and in noisy environments. The superb ability of the human auditory system has motivated researchers to include features of human perception in the speech recognition process. This dissertation investigates the roles of perceptual features of human hearing in automatic speech recognition in clean and noisy environments. Methods of simplified synaptic adaptation and two-tone suppression by companding are introduced by temporal processing of speech using a zero-crossing algorithm. It is observed that a high frequency enhancement technique such as synaptic adaptation performs better in stationary Gaussian white noise, whereas a low frequency enhancement technique such as the two-tone sup- pression performs better in non-Gaussian non-stationary noise types. The effects of static compression on ASR parametrization are investigated as observed in the psychoacoustic input/output (I/O) perception curves. A method of frequency dependent asymmetric compression technique, that is, higher compression in the higher frequency regions than the lower frequency regions, is proposed. By asymmetric compression, degradation of the spectral contrast of the low frequency formants due to the added compression is avoided. A novel feature extraction method for ASR based on the auditory processing in the cochlear nucleus is presented. The processings for synchrony detection, average discharge (mean rate) processing and the two tone suppression are segregated and processed separately at the feature extraction level according to the differential processing scheme as observed in the AVCN, PVCN and the DCN, respectively, of the cochlear nucleus. It is further observed that improved ASR performances can be achieved by separating the synchrony detection from the synaptic processing. A time-frequency perceptual spectral subtraction method based on several psychoacoustic properties of human audition is developed and evaluated by an ASR front-end. An auditory masking threshold is determined based on these psychoacoustic e?ects. It is observed that in speech recognition applications, spec- tral subtraction utilizing psychoacoustics may be used for improved performance in noisy conditions. The performance may be further improved if masking of noise by the tonal components is augmented by spectral subtraction in the masked region.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automatic speech recognition</field><field name="subject">Signal processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Speech processing systems</field><field name="subject">Speech synthesis</field><field name="subject">Perceptual features for speech recognition</field><field name="subject">Two-tone suppression for ASR</field><field name="subject">Synoptic adaptation</field><field name="subject">Compressive non-linearity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0187</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Micromechanical investigation of MEMS-based short-wave infrared tunable Fabry-Perot filters</field><field name="creator">Walmsley, Byron Alan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This study investigates the mechanical and physical properties of low-temperature (100-300 ?C) plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposited (PECVD) silicon nitride (SiNxHy) thin films for the fabrication of short-wave infrared tunable Fabry-Perot filters with high fill factor, high cavity finesse and low actuation voltages. It has been the intensions of this work to fabricate a tunable filter that can be monolithically integrated with temperature-sensitive substrates, namely mercury cadmium telluride (Hg(1-x)CdxTe) photoconductors and photodiodes. A range of methods have been utilised to determine the Young's modulus (E), residual stress ([sigma]0), density ([rho]) and Poisson's ratio ([nu]) of PECVD SiNxHy thin films. In order to understand how E, [sigma]0, [rho] and [nu] are affected by process conditions, a range of SiNxHy thin films deposited with varying chuck temperatures, RF powers and chamber pressures were measured. The resonance method was used to determine E and [nu] of SiNxHy thin films deposited under varying process conditions. The resonance method involves exciting the bending and torsional vibration modes of a microcantilever beam fabricated from a film. The E and G values can be extracted directly from the bending and torsional vibration modes and the [nu] value can be determined from the calculated E and G values. The density of the films was determined using the quartz crystal microbalance method. In order to determine the validity of the resonance method, finite element modelling was used to determine its dependence on microcantilever beam dimensions. ...  Increasing the temperature also increases the tensile residual stress of the films. This study also reveals that increasing the RF power and decreasing the chamber pressure increases E and [rho], as well as increasing the compressive residual stress of the films. The theoretical design and analysis, as well as the fabrication of a new surface micromachined short-wave infrared tunable Fabry-Perot filter for adaptive infrared photon detectors is also presented in this study. The proposed structure, termed the suspension filter, uses broad spectral range, high reflectivity distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirrors, resulting in very high finesse filters. The device utilises multiple sacrificial layers to define the resonant cavity spacer and the separation of the top mirror from the supporting flexures. The flexures were fabricated from low-temperature (PECVD) SiNxHy thin films. Separation of the top mirror from the supporting flexures allows for improved fill-factors (up to 79%), as well as increased tuning range. Theoretical optical and electromechanical results shows large wavelength tuning ranges (1.5-2.5 [mu]m) at low actuation voltages (&lt;30 V) are possible using the proposed design, whilst still maintaining a high cavity finesse. Optical characterisation of fixed filter micro-cavities on Si substrates show transmissions of ~60% with small line widths (35 nm) are achievable using the proposed mirror system. Mirror displacement versus applied bias voltage curves obtained from a released filter fabricated on Si show a stable mirror displacement of 620 nm was achieved, whilst theoretical results suggested the required 750 nm mirror displacement is possible using the proposed design.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microelectromechanical systems</field><field name="subject">Fabry-Perot interferometers</field><field name="subject">Thin films</field><field name="subject">MEMS</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and phantom-based studies of the validity and value of quantitative radiological hip structural analysis</field><field name="creator">Khoo, Benjamin Cheng Choon</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Areal bone mineral density (BMD) is measured routinely in the clinic by a quantitative radiological technique, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BMD is used widely to assess non-invasively but indirectly the mechanical fragility of bone and consequently is able to predict fracture risk. While BMD correlates well with in vitro measurements of bone strength it does not directly measure a mechanical property; half of incident minimally traumatic fractures in women occur with BMD values above the World Health Organisation defined threshold for osteoporosis. This arises partly because the mechanical strength of bone is dependent on its structural geometry and material strength as well as bone mineral mass. Essentially, bones fracture when load stresses exceed the mechanical capacity of the material to withstand them. The structural geometry (i.e., the amount of bone tissue and its complex three-dimensional arrangement within the macroscopic bone envelope) defines the stresses produced by a given load, while the intrinsic load capacity of the material is defined by the composition and microstructure of the bone tissue itself. Hip structural analysis (HSA) is a technique that elucidates the structural geometric component of bone strength; essentially combining information available from conventional DXA images of the proximal femur with a biomechanical beam model based on the stresses arising in a combination of pure bending and axial compression. A version of HSA has recently been released commercially, and has obtained US Food and Drug Administration approval for its clinical application. ... Given the acknowledged limitations of the HSA method when applied to 2-D projection images, a 3-D approach to structural geometry, using imaging modalities such as pQCT and QCT or a recently introduced version of DXA that mimics QCT, is indicated for the future. With that in mind and the possibility of the anthropometric phantom being adopted for future accuracy and precision assessments, improvements in the design of this phantom are recommended. Studies to better understand and verify Contents v the relevance of the 'local buckling' phenomenon as a structural geometric factor in the genesis of macro-fractures are also recommended. In summary, it is essential that superior (compared to BMD) non-invasively determined clinical predictors of bone fragility leading to fracture be investigated. Structural geometric variables are potential candidates. This has led to consideration of; (i) the need to progress beyond BMD for a more sensitive and specific bone strength measurement; (ii) theoretical advantages of structural geometry over BMD; (iii) limitations of the current HSA technique based on DXA, including those introduced by its restrictive assumptions; (iv) the value of HSA in longitudinal studies, exemplified by the 'normal' but rapid skeletal changes seen in human lactation, with possible implications for an analogous study of the menopause; and (v) an investigation, using a custom-designed anthropometric phantom, of the adaptation of HSA to certain emerging imaging modalities and methods able to resolve bone structural geometry in three dimensions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Absorptiometer</field><field name="subject">Anthropometry</field><field name="subject">Bone densitometry</field><field name="subject">X-ray densitometry in medicine</field><field name="subject">X-ray spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Hip structure analysis</field><field name="subject">Structural geometry</field><field name="subject">Anthropometric phantom</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of genetic counselling for familial breast cancer on women's psychological distress, risk perception and understanding of BRCA testing</field><field name="creator">Elliott, Diana</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Background: A review of the literature indicated there was a need for more long-term randomised controlled studies on the effects of BRCA counselling/testing on high risk women, including improved strategies for risk communication. Reviews have also shown women are confused about the significance of inconclusive or non informative results with a need for more research in this area. Aims: The general aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of breast cancer genetic counselling on psychological distress levels, perception of risk, genetic knowledge and understanding of BRCA testing/test results in a cohort of 207 women from high risk breast cancer families who were referred for genetic counselling in Perth during the period 1997 to 2001. Short- and long-term impact of BRCA genetic counselling/testing was determined in women with and without cancer in a randomised controlled trial as part of which women were randomised to either receive immediate versus delayed genetic counselling. This included family communication patterns before BRCA testing, anticipated outcomes of testing on oneself and family including intentions for result disclosure. Comprehension of index and predictive BRCA testing with possible results was assessed both in the short- and the long-term and understanding of individual or family BRCA test results was evaluated at long-term. The effect of genetic counselling on breast cancer risk perception in unaffected women was evaluated. This study considered a theoretical framework of educational learning theories to provide a basis for risk communication with possible relevance for future research. ... Only 25% of the original study population (52/207) reported BRCA results and women's understanding of results is concerning. Key findings were: 1. The majority of affected women received an inconclusive result. 2. Out of twelve unaffected women who reported results, seven were inconclusive which are not congruent with predictive testing. This implies that these women did not understand their test result. 3. A minority of untested relatives did not know whether a family mutation had or had not been found in their tested family member or what their actual test result was. This implies either a lack of disclosure or that woman did not understand the rationale for and significance of testing for a family mutation. 4. Three relatives did not understand a positive result was a mutation. Conclusion: The implication of this research for breast cancer counselling and testing services is that women who wait for counselling are no worse off in terms of short- or long-term general psychological distress than women who receive the intervention early. There is a suggestion that unaffected women without the disease found counselling more advantageous than affected women. The meaning of BRCA results as reported by women is concerning particularly women's understanding of negative and inconclusive results and further research is needed in this area. Too much information presented at counselling may affect women's comprehension of risk, BRCA testing and future test results and further research is required to evaluate the effects of information overload.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BRCA genes -- Diagnostic use -- Perth(W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer -- Diagnosis -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Genetic counseling -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Genetic screening -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Familial breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Psychological distress</field><field name="subject">BRCA testing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vitamin E metabolism in humans</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Michael William</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Vitamin E is comprised of a family of tocopherols (TOH) and tocotrienols. The most studied of these is [alpha]-tocopherol ([alpha]-TOH), as this form is retained within the body and any deficiency of vitamin E is corrected with this supplement. [alpha]-TOH is a lipid-soluble antioxidant required for the preservation of cell membranes and potentially acts as a defense against oxidative stress. Individuals who have a primary vitamin E deficiency such as low birth weight infants, secondary vitamin E deficiency due to fat malabsorption such as in abetalipoproteinaemia, or a genetic defect in TOH transport require supplementation. There is debate as to whether vitamin E supplementation in other patient groups is required. Vitamin E supplementation has been recommended for persons with FHBL, a rare disorder of lipoprotein metabolism that leads to low serum [alpha]-TOH and decreased LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B concentrations. We examined the effect of truncated apoB variants on vitamin E metabolism and oxidative stress in persons with heterozygous FHBL. We used HPLC with electrochemical detection to measure [alpha]- and [gamma]-TOH in serum, erythrocytes, and platelets, and GC-MS to measure urinary F2-isoprostanes and TOH metabolites as markers of oxidative stress and TOH intake, respectively. Erythrocyte [alpha]-TOH was decreased, but we observed no differences in lipid-adjusted serum TOHs, erythrocyte [gamma]-TOH, platelet [alpha]- or [gamma]-TOH, urinary F2-isoprostanes, or TOH metabolites. Taken together, our findings do not support the recommendation that persons with heterozygous FHBL should receive vitamin E supplementation. ... Sesame lignans are natural components of sesame seed oil and there is evidence that these lignans can inhibit CYP450 enzymes, in particular, those responsible for vitamin E metabolism. We hypothesised that sesame seed ingestion would increase serum [gamma]-TOH, lower plasma lipids and inhibit platelet function in human subjects with at least one cardiovascular risk factor. We used HPLC with electrochemical detection to measure [alpha]- and -TOH in serum and GC-MS to measure F2-isoprostanes and TOH metabolites as markers of oxidative stress and TOH intake, respectively. We used high-sensitive C-reactive protein as a measure of systemic inflammation. Platelet function was assessed using the PFA-100 platelet aggregation assay. Although serum [gamma]-TOH increased by 17%, we observed no effect on lipid metabolism, markers of inflammation, oxidative stress or platelet function following treatment with ~25 g/day sesame seeds for five weeks. Our findings challenge the hypothesis that sesame seed ingestion provides beneficial cardiovascular effects. In summary, we have studied the metabolism and transport of both [alpha]- and [gamma]-TOH in humans to evaluate the requirements for supplementation and the effects of vitamin E on platelet function and CYP3A4 activity. Specialised techniques using HPLC were developed to measure serum and cellular TOH concentrations both in supplemented and un-supplemented individuals. We also used GCMS to provide a sensitive, accurate assessment of TOH metabolites and midazolam pharmacokinetics in humans after vitamin E supplementation. We have examined the role vitamin E has on important biochemical endpoints, with emphasis on the implications for TOH supplementation in subjects at risk of CVD.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Diseases -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Tocotrienol</field><field name="subject">Vitamin E -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Vitamin E -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Vitamins in human nutrition</field><field name="subject">Vitamin E</field><field name="subject">Platelets</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease</field><field name="subject">CYP3A4</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of the competitive swimming track start based on lower limb asymmetry</field><field name="creator">Hardt, Julie E.</field><field name="description">The swimming track start is a complex motor skill that utilizes asymmetric lower limb action. The purpose of this study was to explore whether it could be optimized by applying the commonly accepted view that there are asymmetries in the function and behaviors of the lower limbs. Initially, the study aimed to examine the relationship between various measures of lower limb asymmetry and the swimmers' preferences for forward foot placement in the swimming track start. Participants underwent a 7 week training period whereby both the left foot forward (LFF) and the right foot forward (RFF) track starts were practiced. The philosophy behind this training protocol was to ensure that participants received equal practice with the preferred and non-preferred stance so that a dominant stance, if it existed, could emerge. Consequently, the relationships between the dominant track start stance and the lower limb asymmetry measures could be determined more accurately. Participants were male (N=11) and female (N=11) swimmers, aged 12-16 years, from the UWA-Uniswim National Age Squad. Kinetic and kinematic data were collected for the track start prior to and following the 7 week training intervention. The intervention was finished when a participant had completed approximately 14 dive sessions where both the LFF and RFF track starts were practiced. The performance criterion measure was time to 5 m. Despite significant differences in vertical force and velocity contributions following the intervention, time to 5 m did not improve for either the LFF or the RFF track start. Four different measures of lower limb asymmetry were collected, including footedness, the preferred track start stance, and the dominant take-off limb for the unilateral and bilateral counter-movement jump (CMJ). Sixteen of 22 participants displayed changes in their dominant track start stance. Eleven participants showed biases for one stance (6 for the LFF &amp; 5 for the RFF), and 11 participants remained or became more symmetrical. Results indicated that the preferred track start stance was the only measure of asymmetry that was significantly related to track start performance (x2[2]= 6.71, p=.04 for pre-intervention &amp; x2[2]=7.77, p=.02 for post-intervention). All other measures of lower limb asymmetry were shown to be unrelated to track start preference and performance. It was suggested that the 7 week training intervention did not provide a sufficient amount of time to see conclusive effects on 5 m time or to make conclusive comparisons between the dominant track start stance and measures of asymmetry. Since the preferred track start corresponded with better performance less than 50% of the time, it was suggested that swimmers and coaches experiment with different dive techniques to find the start which is most effective for them and spend more time on them during training.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Swimming -- Starts and turns</field><field name="subject">Swimming -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Lower limb asymmetry</field><field name="subject">Track start</field><field name="subject">Swimming</field><field name="subject">Training intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differences in university teaching after Learning Management System adoption : an explanatory model based on Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior</field><field name="creator">Renzi, Stefano</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Current literature about university teaching argues that online teaching requires online social learning based on social interaction to be effective. This implies a shift in pedagogy based on engagement and collaboration, instead of trying to reproduce face-to- face teaching, in online environments. However, when a university adopts an elearning platform (or Learning Management System, LMS), most teachers tend to reproduce their traditional teaching, delivering, through the LMS, educational material. This study explored factors which influence university teachers to adopt teaching models based on online social interaction (OSI) when an e-learning platform is used to complement undergraduate classroom teaching. Online teaching model adoption was considered in the framework of technology adoption and post-adoption behavior, i.e., adoption and use by individuals after an organization has adopted an ICT-based innovation (Jasperson, Carter, &amp; Zmud, 2005). Behaviors were investigated using a model based on Ajzen's (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). In total, 26 university teachers  15 from Australia and 11 from Italy  holding undergraduate courses, were recruited. They responded to a semi-structured interview based on the TPB, built on purpose for this research. Teachers were divided into three different groups on the basis of their approach to online teaching, corresponding to three different levels of adoption of OSI.

Christopher</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] One of the standard ways of assessing time since death is from the stages of decomposition of the body. It is well known that the rate of decomposition is affected by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Another factor that can affect decompositional rates is the presence of breaches in the protective barrier of the skin, whether arising from antemortem injury or postmortem damage, including that occurring from animal necrophagy. Scavengers have the potential to affect decomposition by breaching the skin allowing access to associated insect material, feeding on the maggot masses, or by consumption of the carcass itself. Each locality will have its own set of features determining the rate of decomposition of the body, and variation may occur within localities based on the seasons. Such variation implies the need for local calibration of time since death against degree of decomposition and to establish the magnitude of interseasonal variation. When the localities are outdoors, the influence of potential scavengers, and the factors affecting their activity need also to be taken into account. This study investigates the interaction of environmental factors and animal scavenging on the rate of decomposition of pig (Sus scrofa) carcasses at four south-west Western Australia sites; Jandakot, Shenton Park, Perup Forest, and Watheroo National Park. Jandakot and Shenton Park are both close to the Perth metropolitan area and the western coast while Perup Forest is southern and inland and Watheroo is northern and inland. ... The most common insectivore feeding in relation to the carcasses was the Willie Wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys) which was associated with the carcasses in all seasons and all locations except for Perup Forest. The breeding cycle appeared to have a marked influence on the intensity of scavenging by several species. The effect of season on decompositional rates was greatly reduced in carcasses that were exposed to scavenging. It took no additional time for carcasses to achieve skeletonization in winter than in the other seasons in the presence of scavenging. Scavenging had no significant impact on the rate of breakdown of carcasses in summer, when decompositional rates were greatest and scavenging at a minimum. v In Western Australia, it is not uncommon for bodies to remain undiscovered in bush environments for lengthy periods of time due to the low human population density. This study shows conclusively that it is not sufficient simply to consider the accumulated degree day (ADD) when estimating time since death by the degree of decomposition of the body. Attention must also be given to local wildlife assemblages and variations in their activities with the seasons. The implications of this research are in the determination of time of death. If the effects of scavengers accelerate decomposition this must be taken into account when any calculation since time of death is determined. The marked variations between sites in the rates of decomposition of carcasses exposed to natural animal scavenging in this study highlights the need for local calibration of time since death to decompositional stages for all locales. The techniques devised in this study are straight forward and easily conducted yet are informative and essential in determining time since death for bodies which have been exposed to animal scavenging.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic taphonomy</field><field name="subject">Scavengers (Zoology)</field><field name="subject">Biodegradation -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Animal necrophagy</field><field name="subject">Taphonomy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fate of Islamic Science Between the Eleventh and Sixteenth Centuries: A Critical Study of Scholarship from Ibn Khaldun to the Present</field><field name="creator">Abdalla, Mohamad</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to comprehensively survey and evaluate scholarship, from Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) to the present, on the fate of Islamic science between the eleventh and sixteenth-centuries, and to outline a more adequate scholarly approach. The thesis also assesses the logic and empirical accuracy of the accepted decline theory, and other alternative views, regarding the fate of Islamic science, and investigates the procedural and social physiological factors that give rise to inadequacies in the scholarship under question. It also attempts to construct an intellectual model for the fate of Islamic science, one that examines the cultural environment, and the interactions among different cultural dynamics at work. Drawing upon Ibn Khaldun's theory and recent substantial evidence from the history of Islamic science, this thesis also entails justifying the claim that, contrary to common assumptions, different fates awaited Islamic science, in different areas, and at different times.  For the period of Ibn Khaldun to the present, this thesis presents the first comprehensive review of both classical and contemporary scholarship, exclusively or partially, devoted to the fate of Islamic science for the period under study. Based on this review, the thesis demonstrates that, although the idea that Islamic science declined after the eleventh century has gained a wide currency, and may have been established as the preferred scholarly paradigm, there is no agreement amongst scholars regarding what actually happened. In fact, the lexicon of scholarship that describes the fate of Islamic science includes such terms as: "decline," "decadence," "stagnation," "fragmentation," "standstill," and that Islamic science "froze," to name just a few. More importantly, the study shows that six centuries ago, the Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun provided a more sophisticated and complex theory regarding what happened to Islamic science, which was not utilised except in the work of two scholars. The thesis tests the adequacy of the different claims by applying them to four case studies from the history of Islamic science, and demonstrate that evidence for specified areas shows that different fates awaited Islamic science in different areas and times.  In view of the fact that Ibn Khaldun's theory is six centuries old, and that evidence of original scientific activity beyond the eleventh century emerged in the 1950s, what would one expect the state of scholarship to be? One would expect that with the availability of such evidence the usage of "decline" and other single-faceted terms would begin to disappear from the lexicon of scholarship; scholars would show awareness, and criticism, of each other's work; and development of more and more sophisticated concepts would emerge that would explain the fate of Islamic science. The thesis demonstrates that this did not happen. It argues that the key problem is that, after Ibn Khaldun, there was a centuries-long gap, in which even excellent historians used simple, dismissive terms and concepts defined by a limited, but highly persistent, bundle of interpretative views with a dominant theme of decline. These persistent themes within the scholarship by which Islamic science is constructed and represented were deeply embedded in many scholarly works. In addition, many scholars failed to build on the work of others; they ignored major pieces of evidence; and, in most cases, they were not trying to discern what happened to Islamic science but were referring to the subject as part of another project. Thus, in this corpus of scholarship, one that contains the work of some of the 'best' scholars, the myth of the decline remains not only intact but also powerful. Convinced of its merit, scholars passed it on and vouched for it, failing to distinguish facts from decisions based on consensus, emotion, or tradition. There are very few noteworthy cases where Islamic science is being represented in ways that do not imply negativity. There are also some few narratives that present more complex descriptions; however, even Ibn Khaldun's complex theory, which is arguably the most adequate in the scholarship, is non-comprehensive. Some modern scholars, like Saliba and Sabra, present a challenge to the common argument that Islamic science suffered a uniform decline. However, in the absence of any significant challenges to the common claims of the fate of Islamic science, particularly that of decline, it is evident that, at the very least, the scholarship seems to offer support to the work of discourses that construct the fate of Islamic science in single-faceted, simplistic and reductive terms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Islam</field><field name="subject">Islamic science</field><field name="subject">Islamic medicine</field><field name="subject">Islamic mathematics</field><field name="subject">Islamic astronomy</field><field name="subject">Islamic scholarship</field><field name="subject">Islamic scholars</field><field name="subject">Muslim</field><field name="subject">Middle Ages</field><field name="subject">medieval</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040618.091027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Methods for Campylobacter and Arcobacter Detection</field><field name="creator">Abu-Halaweh, Marwan</field><field name="description">Twenty species and six subspecies of the genera Arcobacter and Campylobacter have been described to date.

These proteins also have a pivotal role to play in a number of diseases, including cancer. The sialyltransferase enzymes are responsible for transfering sialic acids from the donor substrate (CMP-sialic acid) to growing cell surface glycoconjugate chains within the Golgi apparatus. The CMP-sialic acid synthetase enzymes are responsible for the synthesis of the CMP-sialic acid, the donor substrate of the sialyltransferases in the nucleus, while the CMP-sialic acid transport proteins are responsible for transporting CMP-sialic acid from the Cytosol to the Golgi apparatus. When these proteins function in an abnormal way, hypersialylation results, leading to an increased level of sialylation on the cell surface. This increased level of sialylation aids in the detachment of primary tumour cells due to an increase in the level of overall negative charge, causing repulsion between the cancer cells. Therefore, the sialyltransferase enzymes, CMP-sialic acid synthetases and CMP-sialic acid transport proteins are intimately involved in the metastatic cascade associated with cancer. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction of cancer metastasis, discussing the roles of three target proteins (CMP-sialic acid synthetases, CMP-sialic acid transport proteins and sialyltransferases), as well as discussing their substrate specificities, with an emphasis on their involvements in cancer metastasis. The Chapter concludes with an overview of the types of compounds intended to be utilised as probes or inhibitors of these proteins. Chapter 2 describes the general approach towards the synthesis of CMP-Neu5Ac mimetics with a sulfur linkage in the presence of a phosphate group in the general structure 38. The precursor phosphoramidite derivative 45 was prepared and isolated in a good yield using Py.TFA. Unfortunately, the target compound 38 could not be prepared. Chapter 3 describes an alternative strategy wherein S-linked sialylnucleoside mimetics, of the general structure 39, with a sulfur linkage, but no phosphate group, between the sialylmimetic and the ribose moiety in the base is targeted. A series of these S-linked sialylnucleoside mimetics were successfully prepared. Cytidine, uridine, adenosine and 5-fluorouridine nucleosides were used to create a library of different nucleosides and with structural variability also present in the sialylmimetic portion. This small 'library' of 15 compounds was designed to shed light on the interaction of these compounds with the binding sites of the sialyltranferase, CMP-sialic acid synthetase and/or CM-sialic acid transport protein. Approaches towards the synthesis of O-linked sialylnucleoside mimetics of the general structure 40 are described in Chapter 4. Several methodologies are reported, as well as protecting group manipulations, for successful preparation of these sialylnucleoside mimetics. Cytidine and uridine were employed as the nucleosides, thus allowing a direct comparison between the O- and S-linked sialylnucleoside mimetics in biological evaluation. It appears from these synthetic investigations that gaining access into the O-linked series is not as straightforward as for the S-linked series, with alternative protecting group strategies required for the different nucleosides. The biological evaluation of some of the compounds reported in Chapters 3 and 4 is detailed in Chapter 5. The sialylnucleoside mimetics were evaluated, by 1H NMR spectroscopy, for their ability to inhibit CMP-KDN synthetase. In addition, an initial 1H NMR spectroscopic-based assay was investigated for inhibition studies of &#945;(2,6)sialyltranferase in the absence of potential inhibitors. The final chapter (Chapter 6) brings together full experimental details in support of the compounds described in the preceding Chapters.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tumour metastasis</field><field name="subject">sialyltransferases</field><field name="subject">CMP-sialic acid synthetases</field><field name="subject">CMP-sialic acid transport proteins</field><field name="subject">Golgi apparatus</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061019.111424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Queer Theory': Intellectual and Ethical Milieux of 1990s Sexual Dissidence</field><field name="creator">Adair, David Francis</field><field name="description">The main problem addressed by this thesis is the question of how to assess the politics and the cultural effects and implications of 'Queer Theory' during the period of the 1990s.  'Queer' was invoked in numerous institutions, spaces, and cultural practices over this period, and yet queer-identified theorists &#150; and many of their critics &#150; have often assumed that this term refers to a relatively unified object.  I ask if it is appropriate to treat these 'queer' occasions in this manner, and whether this 'dispersed' object requires a different approach: one that sets out to describe means and routes by which it became possible and desirable to pose 'queer' problems across so many diverse sites and practices.  In addition, if there are discernible patterns to these distributed cultural capacities and inclinations, what political significance do they have?  These questions inform my account of the career of 'Queer Theory' during the 1990s. A post-humanist approach to these matters is not premised on an essential or a socially constituted general category of 'subjectivity'.  Instead, it addresses 'Queer Theory' as a problem, without automatically critiquing it; it is sceptical of the perfectionist pulsion that has treated this critical practice as either a good or a bad object: dual roles that are mandated by the logic of dialectical criticism.  These roles are exemplified by the frequent relegation of 'queer' in the relevant literature to the 'innately political' or the 'merely aesthetic'.  In this thesis I identify ethical, cultural, and political yields of these conventional choices and the modes of problematisation in which they operate; I positively redescribe them as aesthetico-political practices.  My approach therefore not only deviates from the 'good' or 'bad' critical options, but also from a third option: the equally rationalist response of assuming that 'Queer Theory' is fundamentally a problem of under-theorisation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">queer theory</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">political</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">cultural</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">critical practice</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041014.102015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Implications for Artistic Expressions and Representations of Corporeality of the Experimental Techniques of Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="creator">Adams, Patricia Lesley</field><field name="description">While biological scientists justify their research into human genetic engineering on the grounds of its 'therapeutic' potential, art - particularly the genre of science fiction (whose origins can be traced to Mary Shelly's famous tale, Frankenstein) - has acted on the social through culture to alert us to the perilous repercussions of usurping the role of the 'Creator of Life.'  Now, at the dawn of the new millennium, the scientific project of mapping human DNA seemingly complete, the plight of the genetically-engineered human has become an intense focus of cultural critique. This doctoral project can be differentiated by its focus on aesthetic inquiry into the implications for expressions and representations of corporeality in relation to contemporary biomedical engineering. It has incorporated stem cell research that entails the manipulation and redirection of adult stem cell fates. The project takes the form of practical and theoretical investigations into cellular responses, and is framed within the matrices of both an innovative collaborative art/science research model and the evolving process of practice-led arts research. The exploratory research is discursively located within the system/environment paradigm. This allows for boundaries between the philosophic and scientific disciplines of: 1. epistemology, 2. ethics and aesthetics and 3. biology and technology  to become nodes in a relational network associated with: 1. living and non-living, 2. sentience and consciousness and 3.  conceptions of humanness. The cycle of practice-led research culminates in a body of work that began with a project entitled apoptosis, and developed into a three part quasi-scientific vital force series of installations. Each of these installations references nineteenth century scientific experimental processes employed in a search for the essential components of the human being itself. The series of interactive installations is discussed and the processual, pioneering research model, whereby the artist becomes the 'human guinea pig' is theoretically and visually articulated. In addition, time-lapse videomicrograph image data, collected through laboratory experiments is interpreted and recontextualised by the artist-researcher for representation in the vital force series of immersive installations. In these installations the implications of the issues raised by biomedical engineering processes are expressed as a very physical, tactile encounter. The aim is that these encounters engender a multi-sensory experience for the individual viewer, who, when immersed in the aesthetic, corporeal, interactive installations as a participant who completes the work through their engagement. Thus, the significance of the study lies in its re-privileging of the aesthetic experience of corporeality in the discourses surrounding genetic manipulation. This exegesis, like the doctoral project itself, is cyclical; following the inseparable processes of theory and practice through which the implications of the core research issues for a hybrid art/science practice are explored. It echoes the qualitative, post-positivist research methodology used throughout the project, which aimed to overcome the third person perspective through such strategies as interactivity and hybridity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">System/environment paradigm</field><field name="subject">epistemology</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">aesthetics</field><field name="subject">biology</field><field name="subject">living and non-living</field><field name="subject">sentience</field><field name="subject">consciousness</field><field name="subject">conceptions of human life</field><field name="subject">post-positivist research methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060707.144314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Filtration of Ultra-Small Particles on Fibrous Filters</field><field name="creator">Agranovski, Igor Evgenevich</field><field name="description">The problem of filtration of liquid aerosols by both wettable and nonwettable filters has been extensively studied and the results of the theoretical calculations together with the experimental results are presented. More realistic models of filtration by both wettable and nonwettable filters have been developed and verified experimentally. A new instrument has been developed, and used in the experiments, for the measurement of the absolute concentration of aerosols in the gas stream. This instrument is based on the measurement of the initial vapour content of the gas stream simultaneously with the measurement of the vapour content after the total evaporation of aerosol. The concentration of the aerosol is calculated as the difference between these two values. The instrument was developed to provide fast and accurate measurements of aerosol concentration. The main advantages of the instrument are: high accuracy, simplicity of measurement, possibility of use for a wide range of substances, perfect suitability of operation for automatic monitoring technologies, etc. All rights for this instrument have been reserved and the fully automatic version will be available in the near future. It was found that the efficiency of filtration of aerosol on the wettable filter depends on the thickness of the liquid film on the fibre. This parameter was taken into account in the development of a theoretical model of filtration on wettable fibrous filters. The particle breakthrough problem has been solved by the optimisation of the aspect ratio (the ratio of the height by width) of the wettable filter. On this basis, industrial devices have been developed, patented, and implemented in industry. These devices provide a stable operating efficiency of higher than 99%. It was found experimentally that the efficiency of filtration of aerosol on the nonwettable filter depends on the diameter of the drop suspended on the filter, and on the area of the filter blocked by drops: this influences the velocity of filtration. All these parameters were taken into account in the development of a theoretical model of filtration on nonwettable fibrous filters. On the basis of this model, satisfactorily verified by the experiments, an industrial device has been developed. The harnessing of atomisers makes it possible to maintain the efficiency of filtration higher than 99%, even with a relatively high velocity of filtration of 2.7m/s. The new technology is tackling the problem of handling huge amounts of exhaust gases and this is particularly important for cramped installations when the space available for the air pollution control technology is quite limited. A highly efficient gas cleaning technology has been developed. This technology is based on combining two stages (wet scrubber and filter) of currently utilised air pollution control devices by submerging the fibrous filter into the liquid on the plate. The new device provides an effective division of the main gas stream into ultra-small bubbles which increase the contact area between the gas and liquid phases. It was estimated theoretically and verified experimentally that the efficiency of the proposed 'combined' technology, is 45% higher than the efficiency of the two stages technology. The technology has been patented and will be offered for industrial implementation in the near future.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Filtration of liquid aerosols</field><field name="subject">measurement of aerosols</field><field name="subject">wettable filters</field><field name="subject">nonwettable filters</field><field name="subject">filters and filtration</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050913.164528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Dietary Intake in Kuwait</field><field name="creator">Alajmi, Fahhad</field><field name="description">This study investigated Kuwait food system.

However, it is not clear how these relationships work. In schools of the Lutheran Church of Australia the situation is complicated by expectations that principals will be operating with a Lutheran Christian world view. The precise nature of the role of world view in determining professional action has not been fully researched. This study made use of analysis techniques grounded in symbolic interactionism to examine the construction of meaning and rationale for professional actions by Lutheran secondary school principals. It sought to understand the impact of value on meaning and decision in ethically challenging situations. The central question of this research was: What values influence the reflection of Australian Lutheran secondary school principals as they address ethical dilemmas in their woik? Drawing on the accounts given by three Australian Lutheran secondary pnncipals to provide data for analysis, and making use of membership category analysis techniques, the study found that three statements could be made: 1. There is evidence in the accounts to suggest that the way principals perceive dilemmas is the result of a filtering process where some facts ate not fully considered prior to action. 2. There is evidence in the accounts to suggest that the filtering process is more strongly influenced by sub-rational and trans-rational values than by rational values. 3. There is evidence in the accounts that each piincipal has a world view that is partially shaped by values implicit in the Christian tradition. These findings are tentative because of the limited scope of the research. They have implications for the theoretical literature, suggesting that mote attention needs to be given to the impact of trans-rational and sub-rational values as filters of perception in difficult decisions. 'The findings suggest that any study of the reflection of school principals in ethically challenging situations should take into account the power of non-rational values to be a lens that distorts what is considered in the reflective process'. They also have implications for further research by those interested in Lutheran schools and those interested in the importance of values in shaping perception.

Campylobacteriosis is frequently a mild to moderate self-limited illness and most cases do not require antimicrobial therapy; antimicrobial therapy is necessary for patients with systemic Campylobacter infections, for patients with severe disease, or for immunosuppressed patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Campylobacter species using disk diffusion currently is not standardised by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), however, in order to monitor the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter species, there is a need for standardised or calibrated methods of susceptibility testing. Initially, 90 human clinical isolates of thermophilic Campylobacter species from Southeast Queensland, Australia, were screened for resistance to ampicillin, erythromycin and tetracycline using the disk diffusion susceptibility testing method. Levels of resistance were then determined using E test MIC and agar dilution methods to determine the reliability of disk diffusion results. Results of the disk diffusion testing showed 87 (97%) isolates resistant to ampicillin, 14 (16%) isolates were resistant to tetracycline and three (3.4%) isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Results of disk diffusion testing showed 100% correlation (+1 log2 dilution) with agar dilution for erythromycin and tetracycline, and 77% for ampicillin. E test showed 68% correlation with agar dilution for ampicillin, 100% for erythromycin and 64% for tetracycline. These data suggest that disk diffusion susceptibility testing may be used to screen thermophilic Campylobacter spp. for putative resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline and that the incidence of resistance of Campylobacter spp. to erythromycin and tetracycline is low in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Agar dilution remains the most accurate method for determination of ampicillin susceptibility. Numerical analyses of restriction endonuclease (RE) fragment profiles were performed to elucidate relatedness of the antibiotic resistant isolates and the results suggested a high level of isolate variation. The role of the B-lactamase in the resistance of C. jejuni to various B-lactams has been well documented and B-lactamase production in C. jejuni has been reported in 83-93% of strains. The expression and characterisation of the Campylobacter B-lactamase, however, has not been described.  In this work, standard cloning techniques utilising a high-copy number E. coli cloning vector and a previously described E. coli-Campylobacter shuttle cloning vector were unsuccessful in isolation and expression of the C. jejuni B-lactamase gene in E. coli, possibly due to a lack of expression of the campylobacter gene in its host or low efficiency of transformation. Therefore, in order to facilitate the isolation, expression and characterisation of the C. jejuni B-lactamase gene, it was necessary to construct a new E.coli-Campylobacter shuttle cloning vector for the purposes of expressing the C. jejuni B-lactamase in Campylobacter. To aid in the construction of the vector, the sequence and genetic organisation of a 4.0-kb cryptic plasmid, termed pCJ419, identified in a human clinical isolate of C. jejuni was determined. Plasmid pCJ419 is a circular molecule of 4013 bp and contains four open reading frames (ORFs), the products of which share significant sequence similarity with putative proteins from known C. jejuni and C. coli plasmids.  ORF-1 encodes a putative mobilisation protein (Mob); ORF-2 and ORF-3 encode proteins which have high identity to putative RepA and RepB proteins, respectively, of known C. jejuni and C. coli plasmids.  ORF-4 encodes a protein which has high identity to a hypothetical protein of unknown function, Cjp32, previously described in a pVir plasmid of C. jejuni. Tandem repeating sequences typical of a plasmid replication origin (ori) were identified upstream of the DNA sequences encoding putative replication initiation proteins RepA and RepB. An E. coli-Campylobacter shuttle cloning vector, pGU0202, was constructed using plasmid pMW2 which harbours a Campylobacter-derived kanamycin-resistance gene, aphA(3&#146;)-III. The sequences encoding pCJ419 mob, repA and repB were inserted upstream of aphA(3&#146;)-III resulting in a stable construct of 6174 bp that was used successfully to transform both E. coli and Campylobacter. Subsequently, a novel molecular class D ?-lactamase gene, blaOXA-61, from a B-lactamase-positive, ampicillin-resistant (MIC 64 mg l-1), clinical strain of Campylobacter jejuni, strain GC015 was isolated, cloned and characterized using the newly constructed shuttle vector pGU0202.  An open reading frame of 774 bp was identified on a ClaI genomic fragment of 2.2 kb and encodes a protein of 257 amino acids.  Conserved motifs composed of identical amino acids typical of penicillin-recognising proteins and specific class D motifs were identified. blaOXA-61 was cloned into the shuttle cloning vector pGU0202 and expressed in B-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-susceptible C. jejuni and E. coli. A conserved 122-bp sequence directly upstream of blaOXA-61 was identified and shown to be required in cis for high-level resistance of Campylobacter to the penicillins although blaOXA-61 expressed only at low levels in E.coli. Southern hybridisation analysis demonstrated that the bla gene was chromosomally encoded and present on the same BglII and ClaI-digested genomic DNA fragments from various strains of Campylobacter with ampicillin MICs of between 4 and 64 mg l-1. In addition, DNA fragments encoding two putative zinc-dependent hydrolases from the metallo-B-lactamase superfamily, designated GLX2-1 and GLX2-2, were identified in a clinical isolate of Campylobacter jejuni, strain 012, cloned and sequenced. A strictly conserved motif, -H-X-H-X-D-, characteristic of the metallo- B-lactamase superfamily of proteins, including the class B metallo- B-lactamases, was identified in both proteins although functional B-lactamase could not be expressed in either E. coli or C. coli transformed using the C. jejuni hydrolase-containing shuttle vector pGU0202.  Further work is warranted to determine the exact function of these proteins.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Campylobacter jejuni</field><field name="subject">lactamase gene</field><field name="subject">E test</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060111.172351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Labour Utilisation in Queensland Hospitals</field><field name="creator">Allan, Cameron</field><field name="description">Within Australia and in Europe. there is evidence of growth in the incidence of non&#172;standard forms of employment such as part-time and casual work. Part of this growth can be attributed to changes in the structure of the economy and the increasing importance of service industries where non-standard forms of employment proliferate. There is also evidence, however, that employers at the firm level are progressively expanding their use of non-standard employment and reducing their reliance on full-time labour. One explanation for this organisational-level phenomena has been suggested by Atkinson (1987) in his account of the &#145;flexible firm&#146;. Atkinson claims that employers are increasingly attempting to divide the workforce into two major segments: a skilled, full-time core labour force and an unskilled, non-standard segment. This thesis examines Atkinson&#146;s &#145;flexible firm&#146; model through a study of labour-use practices of three acute hospitals in Queensland. A main finding of this thesis is the generalised and substantial growth of non-standard employment in all types of Queensland hospitals. The growth of non-standard hospital labour is not as, Atkinson would suggest, largely the result of demand-side strategies of employers but is also conditioned by supply-side factors. Gender, rather than skill, is found to be an important determinant of the proliferation of non-standard employment. Non-standard employment is not the major labour adjustment mechanism in all sectors of the hospital industry. Labour intensification is a critical and overlooked form of labour adjustment in the public sector. Overall, this thesis concludes that employers&#146; labour-use practices need to be conceptualised within the context of the opportunities and constraints imposed by the interaction of demand and supply-side factors.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flexible firm</field><field name="subject">non-standard work hours</field><field name="subject">hospital staff</field><field name="subject">labour</field><field name="subject">Queensland hospitals</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050906.171638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Different Agenda: The Changing Meaning of Public Service Efficiency and Responsiveness in Australia's Public Services</field><field name="creator">Allan, Geoffrey</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the changing nature of efficiency and tesponsiveness of Australian public services over the past century It will examine how over the past 100 years efficiency has been improved and assessed. It will also examine how, since the 1970s, efficiency has become synonymous with responsiveness. The main argument of this thesis is that the nature of efficiency and responsiveness has changed over the past century.. Reforms introduced fiom the 1970s where the rationale at the time was improved efficiency, were essentially designed to make the public service more accountable and thereby responsive to the political executive. The study will examine: 1. the measures governments employed to improve efficiency and assess their effectiveness; 2. how responsiveness became the corollary of efficiency; 3. the resultant changes assessment of government perfbrmance; and 4. the effect these changes had on the Westminster system in Australia. The thesis is in three parts. Part one deals with the nature of public service efficiency and responsiveness. It examines the literature surrounding the nature of the terms and provides a definition of each. Part two details and analyses how public service efficiency was measured and improved from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the 1970s. It will detail the rise and decline in public service boards and commissions and how they were used to initially limit patronage and then to act as monitoring agencies to ensure that public service input costs were as small as they could be 1i will also detail how other factors, such as the training and education of staff and computerisation had an increasing role in improving efficiency. The third part deals with the changes that have occurred since the 1970s. This will examine how responsiveness emerged as an issue and how it became an essential companion to efficiency when promoting bureaucratic change.. It will examine how the nomenclature of efficiency has been applied when the political executive seeks to ensure greater responsiveness from the public service. This third part will examine the main apparatus that were employed by the political executive to improve efficiency and responsiveness: progr am budgeting, corporate planthng, efficiency audits and contracts with senior staff. Finally, I will demonstrate the inability or unwillingness of many ministers and governments to detail policy objectives and their reluctance to evaluate the effectiveness of spending. This was accompanied by a greater reliance on senior employment contracts as the main lever to improve efficiency and responsiveness of the service.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian public services</field><field name="subject">efficiency in government</field><field name="subject">political executive</field><field name="subject">Westminster system</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060914.104311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preaching in Context: The Role of Preaching in Nazarene Worship</field><field name="creator">Allder, Bruce George</field><field name="description">This qualitative research study explores the role of the sermon in corporate Nazarene worship. The context of this study is located with the Christian, Protestant, evangelical, Wesleyan theological tradition as expressed through the Church of the Nazarene in Australia. The church is briefly described from a Wesleyan perspective. Seven features are identified as historically important within the worship experience of Nazarenes;  Biblically centred, centrality of the sermon, connection with Christian tradition, the preacher's life, encounter with self and the divine, community, and practical and relevant to present life. The conceptual lens through which the worship experiences are described is Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), as primarily articulated by Yrj&#246; Engestr&#246;m (1999). The philosophical roots of CHAT and the concept of activity are described along with the structure of activity. Additionally, the compatibility of Wesleyan theology with the conceptual understanding of CHAT is presented. The interactive context of Nazarene worship is one of the compelling reasons given for using CHAT as the conceptual base for this study. Three corporate Nazarene worship experiences in three different Nazarene congregations are examined in detail using four research methodologies; namely, video taping, video stimulated recall interviews, focus groups, and observation reports. The data gathered is by way of transcriptions based on the video taping of the sermons, stimulated recall interviews and focus groups and is managed by use of the NUD*IST (5) computer program. The observation reports are used to gain insight into specific context issues. Nazarene worship is then mapped by relating the features found to be historically important in Nazarene worship to elements of the activity system. The role of the Bible, the sermon, Christian tradition, the preacher's life, the church community, personal encounter, divine encounter, and the application and the call to decision are identified in CHAT terms. The focus of this study is within Steps 1 and 2 of Engestr&#246;m's (2000) expansive development cycle. Through the mapping of Nazarene worship, tensions are identified and their possible sources explored. The tensions of confrontation versus care, creation of a quiet, meditative environment versus noisy, dynamic environment, planning versus spontaneity, and individual versus community orientation are all explored in turn. Possibilities for resolution of these tensions are suggested as a means of guiding the continued development of the activity of Nazarene worship. Possible resolution of these tensions includes the change of the focus of sermons from confrontation to empowerment, the change of the structure of sermons to encompass the visualisation of the change sought, the change of the perceptions of the preacher to one of a sojourner, and the cultivation of spontaneity within sermon delivery. The static nature of the sermon as an instrument in both the sermon's historical development and the development of the corporate worship experience points to the need for the development of the sermon as a more flexible instrument. These conclusions have implications for the teaching of preaching in schools preparing Nazarene preachers. This study contributes to the conceptual basis for the ongoing development of clergy in their preaching ministry. This study has also made visible the difficulty of applying the conceptual framework of CHAT to the complex situation of corporate Nazarene worship experience. While conceptually it may be possible to differentiate between elements within an activity system, their practical distinction is less precise. This imprecision can create confusion especially at the tertiary and quaternary levels of contradictions and may need more precise articulation of the interactions within the activity system as well as between activity systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nazarene worship</field><field name="subject">Church of Nazarene</field><field name="subject">Christian tradition</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060914.114727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Destination Competitiveness: Interrelationships Between Destination Planning and Development Strategies and Stakeholders' Support in Enhancing Oman's Tourism Industry</field><field name="creator">Al-Masroori, Rashid Salim</field><field name="description">A critical understanding of stakeholders' involvement in destination tourism planning and development, and the factors that influence their perceptions, opinions and involvement in the decision-making process and evaluation of the destination competitive strategies, is not only important for tourism destination planners and managers, but also for the host community's support for tourism development and the destination's competitiveness. It has been widely recognised that tourism destinations need to plan their development strategies to succeed internationally and gain a sustainable competitive advantage. However, there is scant empirical evidence that addresses approaches in which stakeholder participation in the planning process contributes to destination competitiveness. This study examines the interrelationships between various destination-specific situational factors, including economic, social, political, environmental, and cultural factors, community participation, community attachment, and impact on the development of the Sultanate of Oman's tourism resources and attractions, and in turn the support of its competitive strategies. Furthermore, it investigates potential effects of those interrelationships on the government's initiatives in formulating and implementing tourism development, management and marketing policies/strategies. The key objective is to develop and empirically test a conceptual framework of tourism destination competitiveness that focuses on a stakeholder's perspective of Oman, and investigates the interrelationships between its constructs. Such an approach echoes the stakeholder perspective of 'Third Way' tourism planning suggested by Burns (2004). This study utilises social exchange and stakeholder theory. Accordingly, the research problem is: How does the interrelationship between destination-specific situational factors, stakeholders' perceived power (community participation), and community attachment, impact on the development of Oman's tourism resources and attractions, and in turn the support of its competitive strategies? Furthermore, what effects may those interrelationships have on the government's approaches in formulating and implementing tourism development and marketing policies? A four-step methodological approach including qualitative and quantitative methods was applied. Following research refinement and pilot studies, a total of 987 usable questionnaires were collected from Omani stakeholders using a convenience and quota sampling method. The final empirical results were submitted to three focus groups in Oman for elucidation and confirmation of results, with a particular focus on the practical implications. The hypotheses testing indicated that tourism stakeholders' preferences about tourism resources and attractions development are a function of socio-cultural impacts, economic impacts, and community participation. Furthermore, the results highlighted a strong link between stakeholders' preferences about tourism resources and attractions and support for competitive destination strategies such as destination marketing efforts and activities, and sustainable destination management and practices. Additionally, empirical results supported the existence of a relationship between community participation and community attachment constructs; however this relationship was somewhat negative. The study also did not prove the existence of any relationship between community attachment and preferences about tourism resources and attractions development constructs. Furthermore, new findings that were not hypothesised indicated that tourism stakeholders who perceived socio-cultural and economic impacts were most likely to support further tourism development and competitive destination strategies. Additionally, stakeholders' attachment to their communities had a weak but positive effect on their perception about tourism's environmental impacts and sustainable destination management and practices. The focus group participants mostly confirmed the study's empirical findings with a few diverging opinions regarding some issues such as environmental impacts and mass tourism versus alternative tourism policies. Thus, the study's findings provided various theoretical and methodological contributions, closing the gap in the notions of destination competitiveness and stakeholders' active participation in tourism planning and development. As well, the practical implications of the study's findings could be adopted by Oman's tourism planning authorities to enhance the destination's competitiveness in the international tourism marketplace.

Currently, however, it is common practice to discard this information in favour of features that are derived purely from the short-time magnitude spectrum. There are two reasons for this: 1) the results of some well-known human listening experiments have indicated that the short-time phase spectrum conveys a negligible amount of intelligibility at the small window durations of 20-40 ms used for ASR spectral analysis, and 2) using the short-time phase spectrum directly for ASR has proven di?cult from a signal processing viewpoint, due to phase-wrapping and other problems. In this thesis, we explore the possibility of using short-time phase spectrum information for ASR by considering the two points mentioned above. To address the ?rst point, we conduct our own set of human listening experiments. Contrary to previous studies, our results indicate that the short-time phase spectrum can indeed contribute signi?cantly to speech intelligibility over small window durations of 20-40 ms. Also, the results of these listening experiments, in addition to some ASR experiments, indicate that at least part of this intelligibility may be supplementary to that provided by the short-time magnitude spectrum. To address the second point (i.e., the signal processing di?culties), it may be necessary to transform the short-time phase spectrum into a more physically meaningful representation from which useful features could possibly be extracted. Speci?cally, we investigate the frequency-derivative (or group delay function, GDF) and the time-derivative (or instantaneous frequency distribution, IFD) as potential candidates for this intermediate representation. We have performed various experiments which show that the GDF and IFD may be useful for ASR. We conduct several ASR experiments to test a feature set derived from the GDF. We ?nd that, in most cases, these features perform worse than the standard MFCC features. Therefore, we suggest that a short-time phase spectrum feature set may ultimately be derived from a concatenation of information from both the GDF and IFD representations. For best performance, the feature set may also need to be concatenated with short-time magnitude spectrum information. Further to addressing the two aforementioned points, we also discuss a number of other speech applications in which the short-time phase spectrum has proven to be very useful. We believe that an appreciation for how the short-time phase spectrum has been used for other tasks, in addition to the results of our research, will provoke fellow researchers to also investigate its potential for use in ASR.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Short-time Fourier transform</field><field name="subject">phase spectrum</field><field name="subject">magnitude spectrum</field><field name="subject">speech perception</field><field name="subject">automatic speech recognition</field><field name="subject">overlap-add procedure</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060727.090845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy Design and the Calculation of Political Risk</field><field name="creator">Althaus, Catherine Eileen</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the concept of political risk. It explores how political actors determine whether something is politically risky and what implications this judgment holds for policy design. It establishes that calculations of political risk are a day-to-day occurrence in political life, that they uniquely and influentially structure the public policy process, and that political risk analysis is a valid and distinct conceptual framework. Surveying an extensive multidisciplinary literature, the thesis clarifies its definition of political risk and identifies a gap in the existing political science literature concerning the concept. It exposes a hiatus between the political science discipline and political practice in the recognition of political risk calculation as a central aspect of political judgment. Because the theory of political risk is underdeveloped in political science, the thesis pieces together the existing wisdom from other disciplines that might inform a definition of political risk.  It then plots a set of hypotheses to assist in constructing a foundational appreciation of what political risk calculation might entail. The thesis tests the resulting hypotheses using empirical research.  A survey of 111 Australian political actors is conducted in order to determine how political risk is understood and operationalised in political practice and to ascertain the consequences of political risk for decision making and policy design.  Survey results are complemented by a comparative analysis of four policy issues.  The case studies selected were the Citizen's Charter and Mad Cow crisis of the British Major Government and the Charter of Social and Fiscal Responsibility and Smart State policies initiated by the Queensland Beattie Government.  The comparative analysis of these cases is designed to add rigour to the interview data.  It also provides additional information concerning the policy design implications of political risk calculation by relating interview findings to substantive policy problems. Together, this multi-method research demonstrates that political risk provides a fresh analytical perspective on public policy. Political risk analysis describes a unique aspect of political reality and explains in new ways the decision making process underpinning policy design. Political risk analysis also defends political action against claims of irrationality and attacks that suggest that politics is based on sheer cynicism, because it shows that political risk calculation boasts a defensible logic of its own.  In fact, the thesis concludes that political risk provides a conceptual tool that begins to unravel some of the 'mystery' of politics that confounds technocratic models of policy analysis.  Awareness of political risk calculation re-establishes political decision making as an endeavour where investigation must proceed with an appreciation of the integrated nature of human judgment that utilises both 'rational' and 'extra-rational' capacities to confront uncertainty.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Political risk</field><field name="subject">political science</field><field name="subject">policy design</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050824.120313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peculiarities of Nanoparticle Formation and Implications to Generation of Environmental Aerosols</field><field name="creator">Altman, Igor</field><field name="description">This Thesis considers peculiarities of nanoparticle formation from the gas in different systems. The main role of the surface condensation in the nanoparticle growth in metal flames was established through a series of experiments and was described by the developed model. The stagnation of the post-nucleation nanoparticle growth was experimentally revealed and theoretically explained. The influence of generation conditions on the post-processing nanoparticle properties was examined. The non-isothermal approach to correct the homogeneous nucleation theory was developed. The results of this work can be summarized in 3 categories: (1) Nanoparticle formation in metal flames. In this work, it was demonstrated that the surface condensation is a main process responsible for nanooxides growth during metal combustion. It was shown that the rate of this condensation growth is consistent with the exponential law, which could lead to the formation of the lognormal particle size distribution in the system, where the Brownian coagulation is suppressed. The post-nucleation stagnation of the nanoparticle growth was found. The particle overheating was suggested as a cause of the growth stagnation. The found stagnation leads to the accumulation of the supercritical clusters in the system generating nanoparticles. The role of these supercritical clusters in the nanoparticle agglomeration was considered. (2)	Study of properties of nanoparticles generated in different metal flames. The light absorption, photoluminescence and magnetic properties of nanoparticles produced in different metal flames were examined. The significant broadening of the absorption edge was found in nanooxides produced by direct metal combustion. This broadening allowed one to excite the unforeseen photoluminescence from these nanoparticles. The significant light absorption in the visible light found in the titania particles produced by metal combustion allows one to consider these particles as a prospective photocatalyst. The unusual optical properties revealed were related to the extreme conditions of the nanoparticle formation, namely, to high energy release (about 5 eV per condensing molecule). The stabilization of spinel structure was found in iron oxide particles synthesized by iron combustion. It allowed one to produce nanoparticles with magnetization close to the high-limit value of the bulk. (3) Approach to correct the homogeneous nucleation theory. The existing homogeneous nucleation theory implies that nucleation occurs at isothermal conditions, i.e. subcritical clusters have the same temperature as the ambient gas does. However, the theory overestimates the actual nucleation rate and underestimates the critical cluster size. It is understandable that due to release of the latent heat of condensation, the cluster temperature in the nucleating system should be higher than the environment temperature. In this work, it was suggested the method to account for the cluster overheating during nucleation. It was demonstrated that the consistent description of the detailed balance in the nucleating system may allow one to evaluate magnitudes of overestimation of the actual nucleation rate and underestimation of the number of molecules in the critical cluster, usually obtained by the isothermal nucleation theory. The numerical estimates are in good agreement with the wellknown experimental results. The implications of the results to generation of atmospheric aerosols were discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanoparticle formation</field><field name="subject">metal flames</field><field name="subject">homogeneous nucleation theory</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051111.122816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated Study of Coastal Wetland Characteristics and Geomorphic Processes in a South East Queensland Catchment</field><field name="creator">Anorov, Julie Margaret</field><field name="description">Coastal wetlands are dynamic ecosystems that are highly susceptible to change due to natural and human factors. The study area, located within the Native Dog Creek sub-catchment of the Logan River - which drains into Moreton Bay, south east Queensland - holds a detailed history of environmental change spanning most of the Holocene epoch. This history is preserved in the estuarine sedimentary record and is a valuable indicator of natural environmental change. More recently, human-induced changes within the study area have been superimposed on the natural process of environmental change. In order to develop a conceptual bio-geomorphic model of the coastal wetlands of Native Dog Creek, this thesis examined - on an integrated catchment basis - the evolution and connectivity of four coastal wetland community types (Melaleuca, Casuarina, saltmarsh and mangroves). The research consisted of four discrete studies within the study area: a geomorphic investigation that provided a framework for understanding how the wetlands evolved during the Holocene epoch; an acid sulfate soil (ASS) study that surveyed the distribution and concentration of sulfides; a palynological study that examined the natural directions of ecosystem change; and an investigation of the impact of specific human activities on these ecosystems. Detailed stratigraphic modelling found that the Logan River system (and its Native Dog Creek sub-catchment) has evolved from an infilling estuary since the peak of the Holocene transgression 6500 years before present. Recognition of the major controls that influenced geomorphic coastal development during the Holocene, provided important insights into the distribution and genesis of estuarine pyritic sediments which strongly influence the soils within the study area. In general, the estuarine central basin and fluvial delta sediments posed the greatest risk to the environment from acidification if disturbed. The major focus of the ASS study was to survey the distribution of ASS and to identify other areas most vulnerable to acidification. A predictive approach that combined chemical and stratigraphic analysis was used. Results showed that these areas are intrinsically related to their environment of deposition. The study found, for example, that the alternation of excessively wet and dry conditions - combined with high organic carbon levels and variations in microtopography - provided ideal conditions for the re-formation of pyrite in the stream channel within the Melaleuca wetlands. The palaeo-environmental study reconstructed the evolution of Holocene coastal wetland vegetation during the marine transgression and subsequent shoreline progradation. Pollen records from the four representative wetland communities (previously mentioned) were examined. The results found the mid-late Holocene vegetation history was controlled by the development of geomorphic features that have affected freshwater input, drainage and salinity. In response to the progradation of the shoreline after sea level stabilised, changes in fossil pollen from mangroves and saltmarsh taxa during the early-mid Holocene, to freshwater taxa during the late Holocene, are estimated to have taken 800 years. Thus, pollen analysis when used in combination with stratigraphic modelling, provided an important point of reference for rates of natural ecological change in response to evolutionary changes to the physical environment. The wetlands within the study area have suffered varying degrees of disturbance since European settlement in the 1820s. The most significant changes occurred during early European settlement, when vast areas of coastal lowlands were cleared for timber, sheep and cattle grazing and for agricultural purposes. A second period of change occurred from 1989 to 1995, when the Melaleuca community suffered dieback in response to hydrological modifications to Native Dog Creek for the development of a golf course. Results indicate that human-induced changes over the past 170 years have occurred at a rate far beyond the ability of the natural ecosystem to adapt or move to a more ecologically sustainable state, at least in the short-term. Hence the current environment is experiencing degradation through both decline in health and loss of indigenous species. The development of a conceptual bio-geomorphic model was based on the integration of results from all four studies, in an effort to provide a holistic understanding of the coastal wetland environment and of the impact of human-induced changes upon that environment. If these vulnerable ecosystems are to be maintained, successful and sustainable coastal management strategies must rely on a sound scientific understanding of the response of a coastal ecosystem to both human and environmental changes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coastal wetland (Queensland</field><field name="subject">Australia)</field><field name="subject">catchment geomorphology</field><field name="subject">geomorphic processes</field><field name="subject">coastal wetlands</field><field name="subject">bio-geomorphic model</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060223.153104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional Assessment and Nutritional Knowledge of Lifesavers, Ironmen and Lifeguards</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Rhonda Margaret</field><field name="description">Despite surf lifesavers being national icons of good health and good nutrition, surprisingly little factual information is known about the nutritional status of this unique aquatic fellowship. The purpose of this study was to investigate the nutritional intake and nutritional knowledge of three distinct groups of Australian surf lifesavers. Weighed food diaries are commonly used to assess the nutritional intake of athletes but this method has the disadvantage of a heavy respondent burden. Individuals being investigated must be literate and highly motivated to keep accurate records of food and drinks consumed. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) offer an alternative assessment method to weighed food records as they are relatively quick and easy to complete and do not require a high level of literacy. A secondary purpose of this study was to compare seven-day weighed food diaries with a FFQ that had already been validated for use with an older mixed gender population. The nutrient intakes of 60 members of Surf Lifesaving Australia were measured. Nineteen, who were professional lifeguards completed a FFQ. Thirty lifesavers and 11 surf ironmen each completed the FFQ, a seven-day weighed food diary and a nutritional knowledge questionnaire consisting of 15 multiple choice questions. There were significant differences between the three groups in age and activity with ironmen being significantly younger (mean age 22.9yrs) and significantly more physically active (mean 134mins/day) than either lifesavers (mean age, 31.3yrs, mean activity 46min/day) or lifeguards (mean age 35.8yrs, mean activity 65min/day). There were no significant differences in these parameters between lifesavers and lifeguards. The seven-day food diary revealed significant differences in nutrient intake between lifesavers and ironmen. Lifesavers consumed 1 1,807kJ, 125g protein (1.6g/kg) and 327g carbohydrate (4.Og/kg) while ironmen consumed 14,69/kJ, 1519 protein (1.9g/kg) and 4629 carbohydrate (5.6g/kg). Lifesavers and ironmen exceeded the RDIs for all vitamins and minerals measured. The seven day food diary demonstrated significant differences between the lifesavers and ironmen in energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate, alcohol, thiamin, niacin, calcium and iron. When the nutrient analysis data set for the FFQ was checked this method of dietary assessment was found to be unreliable as greater than 20 per cent of subjects were identified as being under-reporters. Lifesavers and ironmen both had good scores on the nutritional knowledge questionnaire and were able to identify groups of foods as being rich sources of fat, fibre, protein and iron. Ironmen were better able to answer questions specifically related to sport nutrition. All three groups meet the current recommendations for daily physical activity. Lifesavers and ironmen meet the current recommendations for, protein, fibre, vitamin and mineral intake and consume alcohol at levels within the current health guidelines. Ironmen have the highest carbohydrate intake which meets the current general health recommendations but consume less than the current special recommendations of sport nutritionists while lifesavers consume only 44% of energy as carbohydrate. These results suggest that while the both lifesavers and ironmen consume a relatively healthy diet only the surf ironmen could possibly be considered nutritional icons.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutritional assessment</field><field name="subject">nutritional knowledge</field><field name="subject">lifesavers</field><field name="subject">ironmen</field><field name="subject">lifeguards</field><field name="subject">food diaries</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051116.121748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Debt Crises, IMF Policies and Structural Inequality in the Third World</field><field name="creator">Apps, Peter</field><field name="description">The neo-liberal policies of liberalization and deregulation, as utilized by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its dealings with countries of the developing world, tend to facilitate the conditions for financial crisis.  This can be traced by examining the economic crises of Mexico in 1982 and 1994/95, Asia in 1997 and Russia in 1998 and looking at the main causes and triggers of these crises.  It is evident that the financial vulnerability that these countries suffered from existed due to, and not in spite of, these policy prescriptions.  The IMF continues to present these policies as proven successes - a view that this dissertation contests.  Further to this, the policies that the Fund uses are formulated for use in semi-peripheral economies and have little relationship to the actual economic environments of peripheral countries such as those of sub-Saharan Africa or Papua New Guinea.  The ideology of free-markets and globalization is seen as unassailable by the IMF.  By encouraging countries to remain part of the global financial system through debt rescheduling and open-markets policies, the IMF holds an increasingly fragile economic environment together.  This dissertation formulates and tests four hypotheses in relation to Mexico, Asia, Russia and Papua New Guinea and the periphery.  These are - (1) If there are periods of 'irrational exuberance' among investors in Third World debt, these are likely to contribute to debt crises.  (2) If IMF policies are implemented in the Third World as dictated, then their primary benefits will accrue to the elites in those countries and in the developed world.  (3) If Third World countries open their economies to foreign capital, then they are more likely to experience debt crises.  (4) If IMF policies are implemented in peripheral countries, then they are even less likely to be successful than in semi-peripheral countries.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International Monetary Fund</field><field name="subject">IMF</field><field name="subject">debt</field><field name="subject">external debts</field><field name="subject">debtor countries</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">Third World</field><field name="subject">international finance</field><field name="subject">international banks</field><field name="subject">international banking</field><field name="subject">trade liberalization</field><field name="subject">deregulation</field><field name="subject">economic crises</field><field name="subject">financial crises</field><field name="subject">Russia</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Mexico</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031010.143327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laser Cooling and Trapping of Metastable Neon and Applications to Photoionization</field><field name="creator">Ashmore, Jonathan P</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an in-depth study into the characterization and enhancement of a metastable neon laser cooled and trapped atomic beam. The apparatus consists of a standard Zeeman slowed atomic beam loaded into a magneto-optical trap and was designed for applications to electron scattering experiments and photoionization. The efficiency of the metastable neon atomic source was investigated to determine the ideal cathode type for maximum metastable production and optimal atomic beam velocity haracteristics. A series of characterization measurements were performed on the MOT, and the trap volume and population were investigated for a range of trapping and slowing laser intensities and detunings, together with the MOT and Zeeman slower magnetic fields. The volume measurements were compared to standard Doppler theory and it was found that the Doppler model inadequately explained the trap behaviour. It was found that the MOT population characteristics were governed by two processes: two-body losses that limit the trap population at high densities, and the efficiency of the atom capture process which limits the operational range of the MOT over the various parameters. The trap temperature was determined to be 1.3mK via a time-of-flight technique. This was nearly twice that predicted by Doppler theory and the lack of agreement once again suggests the inadequacies in the Doppler theory to correctly model the experiment. The application of the MOT to the photoionization cross-section measurement of the (2p53p)3D3 state of neon was investigated. The MOT decay technique was utilized to measure cross-section values of o351 = 2.9+0.2 -0.3 x 10 -18cm2 and o363 = 3.1 +0.3 -0.4 x 10-18cm2 at the wavelengths of 351nm and 363nm respectively. This is an increase in accuracy of around a factor of five from previous measurements and it was found that the results agreed well with the values predicted by current theories.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metastable neon</field><field name="subject">laser cooling and trapping</field><field name="subject">photoionization</field><field name="subject">Zeeman slowed atomic beam</field><field name="subject">magneto-optical trap</field><field name="subject">Doppler theory</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060202.153538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Aberrations in Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer</field><field name="creator">Ashton, Kevin John</field><field name="description">Genetic changes are hallmarks of cancer development involving the activation and/or inactivation of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, respectively. In non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) development, the initiation of genetic mutations results from exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation. Non-melanoma skin cancers are comprised of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Several related cutaneous lesions also exist, of which solar keratoses (SK) are widely accepted as a precursor dysplasia to SCC development. The study of recurrent genetic changes present within NMSC and SK should help reveal causative mutations in skin cancer development. Such analysis could also elucidate links in the genetic similarity of these dysplasia. The rapid screening of numerical changes in DNA sequence copy number throughout the entire genome has been made possible by the advent of comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). This technique enables the identification of net gains and loss of genetic material within a tumour DNA sample. Chromosomal regions of recurrent gain or loss identify loci containing putative oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, respectively with potential roles in NMSC tumourigenesis. Used in conjunction with tissue microdissection and universal degenerate PCR techniques this can enable the elucidation of aberrations in small histologically distinct regions of tumour. Such a technique can utilize archival material such as paraffin embedded tissue, which is the major source of neoplastic material available for cancer research. This study used the CGH technique to investigate aberrations in BCC, SCC and SK samples. The screening of copy number abnormalities (CNAs) in BCC revealed that although these tumours were close to diploid and generally genetically stable, they did contain several recurrent aberrations. The loss of genetic material at 9q was identified in a third of BCC tumours studied. This is characteristic of inactivation of the PTCH tumour suppressor gene, a known attribute in some sporadic BCC development. Validation of this loss was performed via loss of heterozygosity, demonstrating good concordance with the CGH data. In addition the over-representation of the 6p chromosome arm was revealed in 47% of biopsies. This novel CNA is also commonly observed in other cutaneous neoplasias, including Merkel cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. This suggests a possible common mechanism in development and or promotion in these cutaneous dysplasias, the mechanisms of which have yet to be clearly defined. In contrast to BCC, numerical genetic aberrations in SCC and SK were much more frequent. Several regions of recurrent gain were commonly shared between both dysplasias including gain of 3q, 4p, 5p, 8q, 9q, 14q, 17p, 17q and 20q. Common chromosomal regions of loss included 3p, 8p, 9p, 11p, 13q and 17p. In addition loss of chromosome 18 was significantly observed in SCC in comparison to SK, a possible defining event in SK progression to SCC. The identification of shared genetic aberrations suggests a clonal and genetic relationship between the two lesions. This information further supports the notion for re-classification of SK to an SCC in situ or superficial SCC.  Finally, the CNAs detected have been similarly observed in other squamous cell-derived tumours, for example cervical and head and neck SCC. This provides further evidence to common mechanisms involved in the initiation, development and progression of SCC neoplasia. This study has identified a number of recurrent chromosomal regions, some of which are novel in NMSC development. The further delineation of these loci should provide additional evidence of their significance and degree of involvement in NMSC tumourigenesis. The identification of the cancer-causing genes mapped to these loci will further demarcate the genetic mechanisms of BCC and SCC progression. An understanding of the events involved in skin cancer formation and progression should shed additional light on molecular targets for diagnostics, management and therapeutic treatment.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-melanoma skin cancer</field><field name="subject">NMSC</field><field name="subject">basal cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">BCC</field><field name="subject">squamous cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">SCC</field><field name="subject">solar keratosis</field><field name="subject">SK</field><field name="subject">actinic keratosis</field><field name="subject">AK</field><field name="subject">comparative genomic hybridization</field><field name="subject">CGH</field><field name="subject">chromosomal abnormalities</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030818.122305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electron Coincidence Studies of Molecules</field><field name="creator">Atkins, Danielle S</field><field name="description">The electron-electron coincidence (e,2e) technique yields complete kinematical information about the electron impact ionization process. The (e,2e) technique has been widely used to study dynamical effects in ionizing collisions with atomic targets, however studies of molecular ionization using this technique have been very limited. Recently further experimental studies of small molecules have been proposed, as the cross sections of small molecules are now computable using sophisticated theoretical approaches [77, 24]. This thesis presents dynamical investigations for the electron impact ionization of the molecular targets H2O and H2, employing the (e,2e) technique to experimentally measure the triple differential cross section (TDCS). The TDCS is defined as the probability that a bound electron will be ejected from the target atom or molecule (into a particular direction with a defined energy) and the initial electron will be scattered into a particular direction with a particular energy. All TDCSs presented within this thesis were performed using an electron coincidence spectrometer in the coplanar asymmetric geometry at intermediate incident electron energies.  This thesis presents the electron impact ionization TDCSs of H2O. A series of measurements were performed using H2O in the vapour form. Measurements of the TDCS are presented for the 2a1 atomic-like orbital and the 1b2, 3a1 and 1b1 molecular orbitals at a common incident electron energy of 250eV, ejected electron energy of 10eV and scattering angle of -15o. The experimental TDCSs are compared with theoretical cross sections that were calculated by Champion et al [25, 26] using a distorted wave Born approach (DWBA).  TDCS measurements for the single ionization of the hydrogen molecule, H2 were performed as in recent years there has been evidence that indicates the ejected electron angular distribution is perturbed due to Young-type interference effects. The oscillatory structure which is predicted in the cross section is due to the two-centred nature of the molecule [27, 29]. This thesis presents experimental TDCSs for the ionization of H2 which are compared to TDCSs of helium. A series of measurements for the TDCSs of H2 and He are presented at a common incident electron energy of 250eV and scattering angle of -15o, for a range of ejected electron energies between 10eV and 100eV.  The experimental TDCSs are compared with two types of theoretical calculations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular ionization</field><field name="subject">molecules</field><field name="subject">triple differential cross section (TDCS)</field><field name="subject">electron coincidence spectrometer</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070920.112918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Children's Threat Perceptions in the Relationship Between Interparental Conflict and Child Adjustment</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Erin Renae</field><field name="description">This thesis integrated the cognitive-contextual model of Grych and Fincham (1990) and the emotional security framework of Davies and Cummings (1994; Cummings &amp; Davies, 1996) to investigate the role played by children's threat perceptions in the relationship between interparental conflict and child adjustment. Past research has emphasised the importance of children's appraisals of the threat posed by parent conflict for understanding links between interparental conflict and child outcomes. However, little is known about what it is that children actually find threatening about parent conflict, and what contributes to children's appraisals of threat in the context of parent conflict. In study 1, children (n = 236) aged 10 to 16 years were recruited to examine the relative contribution of four specific threat subtypes - fear of parent conflict escalating, fear of being drawn into parent conflict, fear of parent conflict resulting in family breakdown, and fear of parent conflict disrupting attachment relationships with parents - in explaining links between interparental conflict and child adjustment. Results showed that boys' fear of being drawn into parent conflict mediated the relationship between conflict severity and child internalising problems, while for girls it was a fear of parent conflict disrupting attachment relationships with parents that mediated this relationship. Threat was not found to mediate relationships between interparental conflict and child externalising problems. In study 2, families (n = 57) were recruited to investigate how aspects of parent conflict, and characteristics of the context in which the conflict occurs, shapes children's appraisals of the four specific threat subtypes in response to interparental conflict. The study adopted broader measures, including independent observations, of conflict, context, and child adjustment to further delineate the pathways linking interparental conflict, specific threat appraisals, and child adjustment. Results indicated that children perceived greater threat in the context of destructive parent conflict resolution behaviour, and lower threat in the context of positive family relationships (particularly the mother/child relationship). Specific aspects of conflict and context were differentially related to the four threat appraisals. Direct, gender-specific relationships were found between aspects of parent conflict resolution behaviour and family relationship security, and child outcomes. However, once these relationships were accounted for, specific threat perceptions were not found to predict child outcomes. Overall, the findings of this study suggested that positive parent/child relationships (in particular the mother/child relationship) modulated the stressfulness of parent conflict for children, making it more benign in terms of its impact on children's threat appraisals, and their longer-term adjustment in the context of conflict. Results of the thesis are discussed in terms of the importance of studying relationships between specific aspects of conflict, context, appraisals, and adjustment to further understand those situations in which children find interparental conflict stressful, and those in which they cope adaptively with interparental conflict.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parental conflict</field><field name="subject">Threat perception</field><field name="subject">Adjustment psychology</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Child</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050627.122034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in Dendritic Scaffolds and Surface Functionalisation for Applications in Nanoscience</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Sarah Jane</field><field name="description">Chapter 1 includes a review on dendrimers, their synthesis and applications, with a particular focus on urea-linked dendritic species. The synthetic strategy utilised in this body of work was based on the preparation of a number of branched synthetic building blocks possessing differing terminal functionality. These branched dendrons, bearing three terminal residues and based on the cheap starting material tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) 23, involved the coupling of 3.3 equivalents of an appropriately para-substituted benzoic acid chloride with BOC protected TRIS 24 in DCM in the presence of triethylamine. The p-nitro, p-methoxy and p-methyl benzoyl chloride starting materials were obtained commercially, whilst N-(4-carboxyphenyl)maleimide was synthesised according to literature procedures. The BOC protected dendrons (25&#150;27, 34) were synthesized in yields ranging from 50&#150;92%. Deprotection of the BOC protected dendrons 25 and 26 in DCM with TFA, followed by the addition of 1M Na2CO3 afforded the TFA salts 35 and 36, respectively. The corresponding free base amines 37 and 38 were obtained on further treatment of the TFA salts with sodium carbonate. Deprotection of the BOC protected dendrons 27 and 34 afforded the free amines 39 and 48 directly after treatment with sodium carbonate. Synthesis of functionalised branched molecules containing 6- and 9-peripheral functionalities was achieved by refluxing 2 or 3 equivalents of the free amine dendrons with the bi- or tri- functional isocyanate cores, 15 and 45, in refluxing DCM, in most cases the products precipitated from the reaction mixture after 18 h and were isolated simply by filtration, otherwise the removal of the solvent from the reaction mixture afforded the spectroscopically pure product. Conversion of the peripheral nitro functionalised species 14 and 21 to the corresponding amines occurred smoothly via hydrogenation using 5% Pd/C under elevated temperature and pressure (DMF, 55 &#186;C, 600 psi) and afforded the polyamine 6-mer 51 in 92% yield and the 9-mer 50 in 90% yield, respectively. Similarly, conversion of the methoxy coated 9-mer 42, to the corresponding phenolic compound (AlBr3, dodecane thiol, DCM) afforded the 9-mer polyphenol 52 in an 87% yield. All compounds prepared were fully characterised and crystal structures were obtained for 26 and 35.  Chapter 2 includes a review on self-assembled monolayers of organosulfur compounds on gold, applications, patterning techniques and techniques for the characterisation of these surfaces. A number of surface monomers were successfully synthesized, to be used for various surface functionalisations, including the formation of an amine reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) disulfide 53, via the DCC coupling of 11,11&#146;-dithiobisundecanoic acid 54 with N-hydroxysuccinimide with an isolated yield of 30%. A novel protein-resistant monomer 58 was also synthesized from 11-undecanoic acid 55 via an acid chloride coupling with triethylene glycol monomethyl ether 58, and isolated in a 72% yield. A number of attempts were made to produce an acyl azide SAM monomer 59, with success finally achieved via the acid chloride coupling of 11,11&#146;-dithiobisundecanoic acid 54 with 5-amino-1,3-benzenedicarbonyl diazide 62 to produce 59 with an isolated yield of ~ 30%. Gold surfaces were prepared on atomically flat silicon wafers using an argon-ion sputterer. SAM films were formed on the gold surfaces via traditional solution based self-assembly methodology. A UV patterning protocol was developed, and a successful patterning trial using the NHS terminated monomer to backfill the UV exposed areas of a dodecane thiol monolayer was achieved and visualized using AFM and fluorescence microscopy after treating the surface with aminofluorescein. The covalent attachment of green fluorescent protein to the monolayer surface via reaction with the NHS terminated monolayer was demonstrated. The fluorescence of the biomolecule was preserved. The formation of a monolayer using the acyl azide monomer 59, was characterised by contact angle and XPS analysis. However, preliminary studies into the activation of the acyl azide surface into the reactive isocyanate were unsuccessful. There is however, significant scope for further investigations into this interesting surface technology.  Chapter 3 includes a review on heterobifunctional linker technology with a particular focus on amine and thiol reactive moieties and literature examples of heterobifunctional linkers of this type. Synthesis of heterobifunctional reagents such as 71 and 74 via a two step synthetic methodology involving the coupling of maleic anhydride with the parent amino-acids in acetic acid, followed by a one pot cyclisation and NHS esterification using DCC in DMF were successful, with overall yields of 9% and 32% respectively for the two reaction steps. The one pot extension of 74 with 6-aminohexanoic acid, followed by DCC, facilitated NHS esterification was achieved successfully in a yield of 30%. Attempts to extend 74 with the synthesised amino acid 88 were unsuccessful due to the insolubility of 88 in organic solvents. A different synthetic strategy was devised towards the synthesis of 85 with the coupling of 74 and mono BOC protected ethylene diamine 91 in DCM to give 93 in an isolated yield of 60%. Deprotection of the terminal amine was achieved via reaction with TFA in DCM however all attempts to prepare the free amine were unsuccessful. Subsequent attempts to couple 94 with both succinic anhydride and 92 were unsuccessful. A maleimide functionalized crown ether was synthesised as a molecule for protein modification via the reaction of 74 with 4&#146;-aminobenzo-15-crown-5 97 to produce 98 in an 80% yield. All compounds were fully characterised with crystal structures obtained for 74, 79 and 89.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dendritic Scaffolds</field><field name="subject">Surface Functionalisation</field><field name="subject">Nanoscience</field><field name="subject">Dendrimers</field><field name="subject">Organosulfur</field><field name="subject">Gold</field><field name="subject">Heterobifunctional</field><field name="subject">Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Synthetic</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071122.124705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytic Model Derivation Of Microfluidic Flow For MEMS Virtual-Reality CAD</field><field name="creator">Aumeerally, Manisah</field><field name="description">This thesis derives a first approximation model that will describe the flow of fluid in microfluidic devices such as in microchannels, microdiffusers and micronozzles using electrical network modelling.  The important parameter that is of concern is the flow rates of these devices.  The purpose of this work is to contribute to the physical component of our interactive Virtual Reality (VR)-prototyping tool for MEMS, with emphasis on fast calculations for interactive CAD design. Current calculations are too time consuming and not suitable for interactive CAD with dynamic animations.  This work contributes to and fills the need for the development of MEMS dynamic visualisation, showing the movement of fluid within microdevices in time scale. Microfluidic MEMS devices are used in a wide range of applications, such as in chemical analysis, gene expression analysis, electronic cooling system and inkjet printers.  Their success lies in their microdimensions, enabling the creation of systems that are considerably minute yet can contain many complex subsystems.  With this reduction in size, the advantages of requiring less material for analysis, less power consumption, less wastage and an increase in portability becomes their selling point.  Market size is in excess of US$50 billion in 2004, according to a study made by Nexus.  New applications are constantly being developed leading to creation of new devices, such as the DNA and the protein chip.  Applications are found in pharmaceuticals, diagnostic, biotechnology and the food industry.  An example is the outcome of the mapping and sequencing of the human genome DNA in the late 1990's leading to greater understanding of our genetic makeup.  Armed with this knowledge, doctors will be able to treat diseases that were deemed untreatable before, such as diabetes or cancer.  Among the tools with which that can be achieved include the DNA chip which is used to analyse an individual's genetic makeup and the Gene chip used in the study of cancer. With this burgeoning influx of new devices and an increase in demand for them there is a need for better and more efficient designs.  The MEMS design process is time consuming and costly.  Many calculations rely on Finite Element Analysis, which has slow and time consuming algorithms, that make interactive CAD unworkable. This is because the iterative algorithms for calculating the  animated images showing the ongoing proccess as they occur, are too slow. Faster computers do not solve the void of efficient algorithms, because with faster computer also comes the demand for a fasters response. A 40 - 90 minute FEA calculation will not be replaced by a faster computer in the next decades to an almost instant response. Efficient design tools are required to shorten this process.  These interactive CAD tools need to be able to give quick yet accurate results.  Current CAD tools involve time consuming numerical analysis technique which requires hours of numerous iterations for the device structure design followed by more calculations to achieve the required output specification.  Although there is a need for a detailed analysis, especially in solving for a particular aspect of the design, having a tool to quickly get a first approximation will greatly shorten the guesswork involved in determining the overall requirement. The underlying theory for the fluid flow model is based on traditional continuum theory and the Navier-Stokes equation is used in the derivation of a layered flow model in which the flow region is segmented into layered sections, each having different flow rates.  The flow characteristics of each sections are modeled as electrical components in an electrical circuit.  Matlab 6.5 (MatlabTM) is used for the modelling aspect and Simulink  is used for the simulation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microfluidic devices</field><field name="subject">virtual reality prototyping tool</field><field name="subject">MEMS</field><field name="subject">CAD</field><field name="subject">finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">Navier-Stokes equation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061106.095352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene Expression Profiling of Cylindrospermopsin Toxicity.</field><field name="creator">Bain, Peter A</field><field name="description">Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is a toxic alkaloid produced by several freshwater cyanobacterial species, the most prevalent in Australian waters being Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. The occurrence of CYN-producing cyanobacteria in drinking water sources worldwide poses a potential human health risk, with one well-documented case of human poisoning attributed to the toxin. While extensive characterisation of CYN-induced toxicity has been conducted in rodents both in vivo and in primary cell cultures, little is known about mechanisms of toxicity in human cell types. This thesis describes studies undertaken to further define the molecular mechanisms of CYN toxicity in human cells. Concentration-response relationships were determined in various cultured human cell types using standard toxicity assays. As expected, CYN caused dose-dependent decreases in the growth of three cell lines, HepG2, Caco-2 and HeLa, and one primary cell type, human dermal fibroblasts, according to tetrazolium reduction assays. CYN treatment did not disrupt cellular membranes according to the lactate dehydrogenase release assay in HepG2 or Caco-2 cells after 24, 48 or 72 h exposure, but did cause membrane disruption in fibroblasts after 72 h exposure to relatively high concentrations of the toxin. Apoptosis occurred more readily in HeLa cells than HepG2 cells or fibroblasts, with 72 h exposure to 1 &amp;mug/mL required before statistically significant rates of apoptosis occurred in the latter cell types. CYN did not appear to directly affect the structure of actin filaments or microtubules under the conditions used in the present study. The major portion of the work presented in this thesis comprises a large-scale interrogation of changes in gene expression induced by the toxin in cultured cells. To assess the effects of CYN on global gene expression, relative messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in human dermal fibroblasts and HepG2 cells after 6 h and 24 h exposure to 1 &amp;mug/mL CYN were determined using oligonucleotide microarrays representing approximately 19 000 genes. Overall, the number of transcripts significantly altered in abundance was greater in fibroblasts than in HepG2 cells. In both cell types, mRNA levels for genes related to amino acid biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and protein folding and transport were reduced after CYN treatment, while transcripts representing genes for apoptosis, RNA biosynthesis and RNA processing increased in abundance. More detailed data analyses revealed the modulation of a number of stress response pathways&#8212;genes regulated by NF-&amp;kappaB were induced, DNA damage response pathways were up-regulated, and a large number of genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress were strongly down-regulated. Genes for the synthesis and processing of mRNA, tRNA and rRNA were strongly up-regulated, indicating that CYN treatment may increase the turnover of all forms of cellular RNA. A small group of genes were differentially expressed in HepG2 cells and fibroblasts, revealing cell-specific responses to the toxin. Selected changes in transcript level were validated using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). The modulation of stress response pathways by CYN, indicated by microarray analysis, was further investigated using other methods. The role of tumour suppressor protein p53 in CYN-mediated gene expression was confirmed by measuring the expression of known p53-regulated genes following CYN treatment of HepG2 cells and human dermal fibroblasts using qRT-PCR. Western blotting of protein extracts from CYNtreated cells showed that p53 protein accumulation occurred in HepG2 cells, providing additional evidence of the activation of the p53 pathway by CYN in this cell line. The immediate-early genes JUN and FOS were found to be induced by CYN in a concentration-dependent manner, and MYC was induced to a lesser extent. The mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, implicated in the ribotoxic stress response initiated by damage to ribosomal RNA, appeared to become phosphorylated in HeLa cells after CYN exposure, suggesting that ribotoxic stress may occur in response to CYN in at least some cell types. The expression of a reporter gene under the control of a response element specific for NF-&amp;kappaB was induced at the mRNA level but inhibited at the protein level. This shows that while transcription factors such as p53 and NF-&amp;kappaB are apparently activated in response to the toxin, transactivation of target genes may not necessarily manifest a corresponding increase at the protein level. The current work contributes significantly to the current understanding of cylindrospermopsin toxicity in human-derived cell types, and provides further insight into putative modes of action.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cylindrospermopsin</field><field name="subject">CYN</field><field name="subject">gene expression profiling</field><field name="subject">Cylindrospermopsin toxicity</field><field name="subject">cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">human health risk</field><field name="subject">human cell types</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">human dermal fibroblasts</field><field name="subject">stress response pathways</field><field name="subject">cellular RNA</field><field name="subject">HepG2 cells</field><field name="subject">p53-regulated genes</field><field name="subject">NF-kB-mediated gene expression</field><field name="subject">apoptosis</field><field name="subject">necrosis</field><field name="subject">DNA damage</field><field name="subject">Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii</field><field name="subject">toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20080404.145834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolving Algorithms for Over-Constrained and Satisfaction Problems</field><field name="creator">Bain, Stuart</field><field name="description">The notion that a universally effective problem solver may still exist, and is simply waiting to be found, is slowly being abandoned in the light of a growing body of work reporting on the narrow applicability of individual heuristics. As the formalism of the constraint satisfaction problem remains a popular choice for the representation of problems to be solved algorithmically, there exists an ongoing need for new algorithms to effciently handle the disparate range of problems that have been posed in this representation. Given the costs associated with manually applying human algorithm development and problem solving expertise, methods that can automatically adapt to the particular features of a specific class of problem have begun to attract more attention. Whilst a number of authors have developed adaptive systems, the field, and particularly with respect to their application to constraint satisfaction problems, has seen only limited discussion as to what features are desirable for an adaptive constraint system. This may well have been a limiting factor with previous implementations, which have exhibited only subsets of the five features identified in this work as important to the utility of an adaptive constraint satisfaction system. Whether an adaptive system exhibits these features depends on both the chosen represen-tation and the method of adaptation. In this thesis, a three-part representation for constraint algorithms is introduced, which defines an algorithm in terms of contention, preference and selection functions. An adaptive system based on genetic programming is presented that adapts constraint algorithms described using the mentioned three-part representation. This is believed to be the first use of standard genetic programming for learning constraint algo-rithms. Finally, to further demonstrate the efficacy of this adaptive system, its performance in learning specialised algorithms for hard, real-world problem instances is thoroughly evaluated. These instances include random as well as structured instances from known-hard benchmark distributions, industrial problems (specifically, SAT-translated planning and cryptographic problems) as well as over-constrained problem instances. The outcome of this evaluation is a set of new algorithms - valuable in their own right - specifically tailored to these problem classes.

This methodology is tested in close readings of three relatively contemporary Australian literary texts: David Malouf's short story "A Traveller's Tale" (1986) and novella Remembering Babylon (1994), and Peter Carey's short story "The Chance" (1978). Unprincipled formalism is developed in relation to three broad contexts: the fragmented state of the contemporary discipline of literary studies; the complex of international economic and social phenomena which goes under the general rubric of globalisation; and the specific Australian left-liberal literary critical tradition which I have termed, for convenience sake, the Meanjin literary formation. Unprincipled formalism does not draw a distinction between form and content.  Unprincipled formalism is a critical methodology that is both avowedly socially concerned and strictly formalist.  It is concerned with articulating and analysing the particular social and political interventions made by literary texts (as well as the resultant critical discussion of those texts) through a consideration of the formal techniques by which literary texts situate themselves as acts of communication.  Principal among these techniques is the mise en abyme.   The thesis provides a detailed analysis of debates around the mise en abyme informed by the work of theorists such as Ross Chambers, Lucien Dallenbach, Frank Lentricchia, Moshe Ron, Jacques Derrida and others.   Politically, unprincipled formalism attempts to steer a middling course between neo-liberal triumphalism on the one hand and nostalgic left romanticism on the other.  This involves on the one hand a critique of neo-liberalism drawing on the work of Charles Taylor, Stephen Holmes, John Frow and others, and on the other a critique of a nostalgic romantic tendency in "progressive" critical technologies such as postmodern and postcolonial literary studies.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">David Malouf</field><field name="subject">Peter Carey</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian fiction</field><field name="subject">Australian literature</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">critical method</field><field name="subject">critical methodology</field><field name="subject">literary criticism</field><field name="subject">form</field><field name="subject">formal</field><field name="subject">formalism</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">globalization</field><field name="subject">Meanjin</field><field name="subject">mise en abyme</field><field name="subject">Left</field><field name="subject">Left-Liberal</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040616.120642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lost in Translation: A History of Moral Rights in Australian Law</field><field name="creator">Banks, Catherine</field><field name="description">This thesis is a history of moral rights in Australian law. It traces the historical discourse about moral rights in Australian law and demonstrates how that discourse has shaped the meaning moral rights have come to assume in their current form under the current regime contained in the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rijghts) Act 2000. This history examines the reception and later production of a moral rights discourse in Australian law, and reveals that the historical discourse about Australian moral rights was dominated by the three themes; foreignness, international obligation and economic impact. I contend these three themes fundamentally shaped moral rights as they now appear in the moral rights regime. As the history unfolds, it will become clear that the moral rights regime was organised around a specific repertoire of arguments and imaginings, and it is this discourse that informs this thesis. My argument is pursued in three stages. Section One of the thesis provides the historical detail of the moral rights trajectory in Australian jurisprudence, and reveals, within that history, the emergence of three dominant themes, which are pursued in subsequent detail. In addition to the history, this section also provides detailed discussion of the legislative provisions in order to illustrate moral rights as a product of the history, and it highlights some of the shortcomings of the regime and provides some background for the case study in Section Two. Section Two of the thesis interrogates the structure of the moral rights regime by applying the Act's provisions to the case study of indigenous creators, thus providing a contemporary example of how these rights may work in practice, as the result of the historical discourse. Thus this section sets the scene for final part of the thesis, which delves further into the historical discourse. Section Part Three follows the themes of the moral rights debate as they emerged historically. Reconceptualizing the moral rights discourse in this way helps to explain why the debates about moral rights took a particular course and produced the outcomes it did. The starting point for these discussions is a detailed examination of the themes of foreignness, international obligation and economic impact, and follows these themes as they evolved chronologically. In particular, the discussion reveals that the debates about moral rights effectively fall into two eras. The first era (1928-1988) centred around the question of whether Australia should introduce moral rights and the debates about the appropriateness of the reception. At the commencement of the second era (1988-2000) the question shifted to what form moral rights should take. This then provides a backdrop with which to understand why specific discussions about moral rights were sidelined during the years of debates leading up to the legislation; in particular, the subject and the object; which form the fulcrum of a moral rights action. This is an essential part of the history because it explains why the subject and the object came to be imagined and constructed in such a narrow and limited way and clarifies why the moral rights provisions appear manifestly ineffective, particularly for indigenous creators and their communities. This thesis contributes to legal history in three important ways. First, it provides a detailed account of a discourse about moral rights in Australian law, and in doing so challenges the long held assumptions about their reception and production. Second, it highlights the importance of history to legal discourse. Just as regulatory regimes, institutions, and rules are integral to the law, so too are the informal practices, discourses and contexts on which they were based. Third, it reminds the reader that history is a signpost, and this history of moral rights demonstrates that the way this law was derived, imagined and constructed has significance for the social, cultural and legal context in which that process takes place.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian law</field><field name="subject">moral rights in law</field><field name="subject">Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Act</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061006.114720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstructive Strategies for Artists Engaging With ecology: An Examination of the Relationship Between Culture, Nature and Technology in Ecological Art</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Katherine Rachel</field><field name="description">With the rise in industrial capitalism during the 20th Century, artists increasingly focused on the threat of a disappearing natural world. In the high technology era of the late 20th Century, artists whose practice is termed 'ecological' based their work around new understandings of the relationship between nature and culture, fundamentally underpinned by a shift toward evolutionary, systems-theoretical perspectives from those of conquest and exploitation. Now, at the dawn of the 21st Century, the information era has brought into intersection the discourses of information technologies, quantum physics, and biological science, awakening artists to the challenge of engaging with ecology as the primary subject of their practice. The doctoral project that is the subject of this exegesis focuses critical attention on our scientific and aesthetic understandings of water - a crucial symbolic element of global import in survival. It explores the representation of water in and through art practice that is informed by political ecological awareness and new (digital) technologies. My practice exploits the potential of recent digital technologies to create experiences that aim to encourage a more ecologically sustainable human engagement with nature through this focus on water. This exegesis describes and locates the creative work within an ongoing discourse in contemporary culture that actively seeks to re-establish and redefine the relationship between culture and nature.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecology in art</field><field name="subject">aesthetic understanding of water</field><field name="subject">ecologically sustainable human engagement</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061011.150154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathways to Detention</field><field name="creator">Barrett, Susan</field><field name="description">This research utilised a range of deterministic and stochastic analyses to establish whether Queensland's juvenile justice system processes Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal young male offenders differently. The impetus for this research stemmed from the continued high rates of Aboriginal over-representation within Australia's criminal justice system, despite diversionary measures to reduce such over-representation, and a commitment by the Queensland Government to reduce by 50% the number of Aboriginal peoples in custody by the year 2011. There are two competing hypotheses concerning the cause of this over-representation, (i) external factors such as socioeconomic disadvantage, unemployment or substance abuse, or (ii) systemic disparity within the criminal justice system. For this research, disparity is defined as the unacceptable use of discrimination; discrimination can be appropriate if it is used to define or enhance a situation, such as discriminating between offenders who are recidivists and those who are first time offenders. The inappropriate use of discrimination occurs for example, when harsher sentences are issued to offenders based on non-legal factors such as race or gender. Systemic disparity is therefore used here to represent the inappropriate use of discrimination against an offender by the criminal justice system.  The second hypothesis, one of systemic disparity, provided the framework for this research, which posed the following primary question: Is there quantifiable evidence to support the existence of disparity acting against young male Aboriginal offenders within Queensland's juvenile justice system? Two separate but complementary studies were designed to address this issue: the pathways study and the trajectory study.  The pathways study utilised 20,648 finalised appearances for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal young male offenders in Queensland's juvenile courts, during 1999 to 2003.  Three custodial decision-making stages (police custody, remand, and sentencing) were examined and two questions initially posed: Does the custodial decision made at one stage of the juvenile justice system impact on a subsequent custodial decision-making stage? Does criminal history, Aboriginal status, offence type or an interaction of these factors significantly influence the probability of (i) detention in police custody (ii) court remand (iii) a custodial order at sentencing? It was recognised that other legally relevant factors such as family structure and stability, school attendance and community ties might also influence these custodial decisions; however, for the purposes of this research it was not possible to include these variables in the analyses.  Controlling for criminal history, findings from logistic regression analyses indicated that being detained in police custody increased the odds of being remanded into custody, and being remanded into custody increased the odds of a custodial order. Whilst Aboriginal status was not a consistent factor at any of these three custodial stages, there was clear evidence of disparity acting against the young male Aboriginal offender, particularly early in their criminal career.  To examine these disparities further, these three custodial stages were modeled as eight processing pathways: four of which resulted in a custodial order and four in a  noncustodial order. Using this processing model, a third question was posed: Do young Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal male offenders have different custodial pathways? Findings indicated that Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal young male offenders were in general, processed along similar custodial pathways that did not include police custody, remand or a custodial order. However, young male Aboriginal offenders were less likely than equivalent non-Aboriginal offenders to have been processed along this pathway and more likely to be processed along the pathways that included remand. It was found that young offenders with a chronic criminal history were more likely to be processed along these remand pathways, and Aboriginal offenders were more likely to have a chronic criminal history than non-Aboriginal offenders; there was clear evidence of disparity at specific custodial stages of the system. In addition, as young male Aboriginal offenders progressed deeper into the system there was evidence of cumulative disparity, particularly along the remand pathways, meaning that the probability of being in custody increases as the offender progresses from one custodial stage to the next custodial stage.  Given the existence of disparity, acting within the juvenile justice system and against the young male Aboriginal offender, it was important to formulate viable solutions to such disparity, particularly in light of the Queensland government's commitment to reduce Aboriginal offenders in custody by 50%. Deterministic analyses and computer simulations were used to test the viability of various reduction scenarios suggested by the data. Despite in some instances, different results from the deterministic analyses and the computer simulations, overall findings indicated that to reduce custodial disparity whether at the remand stage, the custodial order stage, or in custody overall (the summation of police custody, remand and custodial orders) that reducing remand, regardless of whether the young offender had been in police custody or not, was the best overall solution.  The trajectory study built on the findings of the pathways study, which had identified criminal history as an important factor in the processing pathways of young male Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal offenders. Using the semi-parametric group based method, the criminal trajectories of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal young male offenders in Queensland were modeled. These trajectories were based on the finalised appearances of two cohorts of young offenders aged 10 to 17 years of age: those born in 1983 and 1984 and who had turned 18 years of age in 2001 and 2002 respectively.  All of these young male offenders had entered the adult system when they turned 17 years of age, and this data provided their complete juvenile history in Queensland. Prior analyses using this method had not considered Aboriginal status or race as a determining factor in these trajectory models, nor had these models been validated either internally or externally in published works. For this research, internal validity was considered as the correct classification of offenders into trajectory groups, and external validity as the ability to reproduce these results in a second or subsequent sample of juvenile offenders.  Two questions were therefore posed in the trajectory study: Do young Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal male offenders have different criminal trajectories? Can the predicted model(s) be validated, both internally and externally? Initial findings indicated that the optimal trajectory models selected on prior knowledge and the Bayesian Information Criterion did not validate internally. This finding brought into question the trajectory results of other published works that had not internally validated their models. The models finally selected as optimal indicated that Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal young male offenders did not have a common criminal trajectory and could not be modeled as one population. Both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal young offenders were modeled by a low-frequency group, a late-onset group, and a chronic trajectory group. However, the young male Aboriginal offender was more likely than the non-Aboriginal to have been in the chronic or the late onset group and less likely to have been in the lowfrequency group.  External validation utilised an innovative but simple method that utilised all of the data in the modeling process along with a sample of this same data for validation purposes: 10% of the criminal profiles, which were characteristic of the trajectory groups, and a further 5% of randomly selected profiles were chosen for validation. All of the characteristic profiles, but only 50% of the randomly selected profiles were validated, and of the latter, the majority not validated was in the late-onset group. In total, 79.2% of the Aboriginal trajectories and 85.6% of the non-Aboriginal criminal trajectories were correctly externally validated.  Overall, there are two important implications from this research for government. First, even though young male Aboriginal offenders are more likely to have a chronic criminal history than non-Aboriginal offenders, this factor does not account for all of the observed disparity acting against the young Aboriginal offender within Queensland's juvenile justice system: there is evidence of disparity within the system that is unaccounted for by either offence type or criminal history. Second, given this chronic criminal history, systemic solutions to systemic disparity whilst viable, will not ultimately resolve this problem: they are only short-term measures at the end of a very long justice system. Longer-term solutions are needed to address external factors such as socio-economic disadvantage, unemployment and substance abuse in Aboriginal communities, before these young people are exposed to the system. Continuing to concentrate on systemic solutions, to such an entrenched problem as Aboriginal overrepresentation and disparity, is a misdirection of system resources and is inconsistent with social justice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Detention</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">juvenile justice system</field><field name="subject">criminal justice system</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">non-Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">young male offenders</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070824.112806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boys and Literacy: Rhetoric and Reality</field><field name="creator">Barron, Susan</field><field name="description">The gendered features of children's development in early literacy, particularly those that contribute to the generally poorer performance of boys, were explored in a dual-phase questionnaire study, conducted across schools in South East Queensland. The potential influences of school type (private and state) and gender-composition of a class (mixed-gender and single-gender schools) on performances of boys were tested on two state-wide tests (The Year 2 Diagnostic Net for Reading; The Reading Development Continuum) and a standardised measure (The St Lucia Reading Comprehension Test). Children and parents were surveyed to determine the locus of significant differences between girls and boys in relation to attitudes to reading, being read to and to constructs of self and others as readers. Girls presented as more positive across these measures. They indicated greater interest in reading and being read to. They reported reading across a wider range of genres for both school and recreational purposes and selected reading as a preferred activity in comparison with others. Boys were more reluctant readers. They displayed poorer attitudes generally and reported reading less in quantity and frequency in both school and home settings. The notion of girls and boys maintaining a positive or negative "image" emerged from a small but influential subset. This derivation was consistent with perceptions of gender-bias in gender-preferences. The profile of achievement across the three measures yielded a story of difference. Boys in private school settings were significantly less likely than girls to obtain higher Continuum scores and boys in state school settings were less likely than girls to be rated as proficient in the Year Two Net Test. Boys from private schools and in single-gender situations outperformed all other subgroups on the Net. Yet, they obtained the worst result on the Continuum, and were in the middle rank on the standardised test. Whether in private or state schools, boys were likely to obtain lower average Continuum scores than females. This was a statistically significant difference in the private school sector. While boys in Private Schools were slightly more likely than girls to be rated as proficient in the Year Two Net test, boys in state schools were far less likely than girls to be rated as proficient on the Year Two Net test, a statistically significant difference. Children attending single-gender, private schools attained higher aggregate scores on the attitude subtests of the Continuum than their state school counterparts. However, children in comparable, mixed-gender, private schools performed neither better nor worse than their peers in single-gender private schools. This comparison does not support contentions that single-gender schooling is superior in relation to the literacy achievements of emergent readers. When comparisons were made at the most general level (male vs. female, private vs. state school) gender did not predict scores in the externally administered St. Lucia Reading Comprehension Test scores. The significant relationship for girls at state schools on the Net test and for girls at private schools on the Continuum (both internally-based measures), coupled with the non-significant differences in relation to the St. Lucia Reading Comprehension Test points to the possibility that internally-based ratings are to some extent driven by teacher perceptions of literacy competence, and such perceptions may at times be unreliable. The corollary observation that not only was the measurement of attitude provided by the Continuum Attitude score significantly correlated with the St. Lucia reading test but also that the latter was not directly influenced by gender affirmed the notion that a school culture of gendered literacy is influencing teacher attitudes related to the achievement of literacy. What analyses of home background capture is the surprisingly lack of any connection between these tacitly understood underpinnings of literacy and the achievement thereof. The lack particularly of any connection between the teacher reading to students and the achievement of literacy was also surprising. In relation to literacy practice, the three most highly identified male activities (kicking a ball, computer games, playing outside) grouped to form a distinct factor (subscale) and this factor score was positively associated at a statistically significant level with scores on the St Lucia Reading test. Not only did private school children obtain better scores on the St. Lucia test, it was private school students whose identification of this highly stereotypically set of male activities linked significantly with an external measure of the achievement of literacy. This linkage seems indicative of an enhanced ability to read social codes more generally and is probably reflective of the social space occupied by private school students. In sum, while students, parents, and teachers fairly consistently displayed a heavily gendered culture with regard to literacy, actual achievement levels, attitudes, home background, and literacy practice disconnected from that gendered culture. That is, there appears to be a subtle but important distinction between perception and reality in relation to the achievement of literacy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">boys</field><field name="subject">academic achievement</field><field name="subject">academic performance</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">reading</field><field name="subject">girls</field><field name="subject">gender differences</field><field name="subject">child development</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">reading ability</field><field name="subject">tests</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040623.140850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Job Change and Job Insecurity in the Police Service: Applying the Cognitive-Motivational-Relational Theory of Emotion</field><field name="creator">Bartrum, Dee A</field><field name="description">This thesis tested an appraisal, coping and adaptation model of job insecurity and organisational change with a sample of police officers. The model integrated key aspects of Lazarus' (1991a, 1999) cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion (personal coping resources, appraisal questions, emotion, coping and adaptation outcomes) with the ten job characteristics (opportunity for control, opportunity for skill use, externally generated goals, variety, environmental clarity, availability of money, physical security, opportunity for interpersonal contact, valued social position and supportive supervision) from Warr's (1987, 1999) vitamin model. The ten job characteristics were viewed as valued aspects of the environment that may potentially be lost or threatened during organisational crisis or change. The service within which the police officers worked underwent a large scale organisational restructuring from late 2001 to July 2002. Three research studies were conducted for this thesis. The first study developed a psychometrically sound, 40-item job characteristics scale, based on the ten dimensions of Warr's vitamin model. This scale assessed participants' worries about changes to aspects in their work environment. The development of this scale met a need within the job insecurity literature for a theoretically-derived measure of valued job features, and enabled the investigation of the appraisal, coping and adaptation model. This measure was included in the questionnaire for the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that formed the second and third major research projects of this thesis. The main aim of the second study was to test a proposed model of appraisal, emotion, coping and adaptation following the experience of organisational change. The model proposed that person variables and personal coping resources (e.g., personal control and coping self-efficacy) would have indirect associations with the adaptational outcomes of Psychological Distress, Life Satisfaction and Job Withdrawal Behaviour. The personal coping resources were proposed to have indirect relationships with coping strategies through job characteristics, appraisal and emotion as well as direct associations with levels of distress, Life Satisfaction and Job Withdrawal Behaviour. The ten job characteristics were expected to have a direct relationship with Psychological Distress, and indirect associations with the three adaptational outcomes through appraisal, emotion and coping. Primary and secondary appraisal was proposed to precede and directly influence emotion. In turn, emotions were expected to directly relate to the coping strategies that were used, with coping strategies mediating the association between emotion and the three adaptational outcomes. An additional focus of this study was to determine whether there were mean differences for males and females on the variables examined. The second study was conducted in November 2002, three months after the restructuring. Two thousand two hundred and eighteen police officers were invited to participate in the study, with a total sample of 303 police officers responding. The antecedent variables (personal resources, job characteristics, perception of global job insecurity, appraisal components, feelings, coping strategies) and the indicators of employee adjustment (Psychological Distress, Life Satisfaction and Job Withdrawal Behaviour) were collected via a self-report questionnaire. Collateral data were also obtained from a friend, spouse/partner or work colleague of the police officer for the dependent variables of Psychological Distress and Life Satisfaction. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were applied to investigate the aims of this study. Some support for a partial mediating model was obtained, mainly with the work specific adaptational outcomes of Psychological Distress and Job Withdrawal Behaviour. The antecedent variables in the model explained a substantial amount of variance for each of the adaptation outcomes. Notably, the antecedents of the model to uniquely account for variance in Life Satisfaction, a non-work contextual outcome, were person variables and personal coping resources. The third research study used a two-wave longitudinal panel design. The principle aim of this study was to test the proposed model of appraisal, coping and adaptation, longitudinally. Specifically, the aim was to examine whether initial levels, and changes in levels over time in aspects of the proposed model predicted later levels, and changes across time in the adaptational outcomes of Psychological Distress, Life Satisfaction and Job Withdrawal Behaviour. The study was conducted in April and May, four to five months after the T1 data had been collected, and seven months after the restructuring. A total of 158 police officers responded from the 303 that participated in Study 2. Difference scores were calculated to examine change across time within hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Three longitudinal regression models (Basic, Change-in-Outcome and Change/Change) were examined to test for robust effects. The model explained considerably more variance in Psychological Distress across all three longitudinal models tested, compared to Life Satisfaction and Job Withdrawal Behaviour. Generally the work related antecedents (T1) had no or minimal association with change in Life Satisfaction. However, change in physical safety was associated with change in Life Satisfaction across the two points in time. Some robust associations were found for emotion coping strategies with Psychological Distress; personal control with Life Satisfaction; and negative feelings with Job Withdrawal Behaviour. The findings from the three studies are discussed with reference to Lazarus' (1991a, 1999) cognitive-motivational-relational theory and Warr's (1987, 1999) vitamin model. The findings from the cross-sectional and longitudinal research studies support partial mediating relationships among the antecedents with the adaptational outcomes. There is debate within the job insecurity literature as to whether potential loss of job features should be included in the definition and operationalisation of this construct. Based on the results of the research, it is recommended that the definition and operationalisation of job insecurity include potential loss of job features and potential loss of the job. The model tested accounted for more variance in the work specific outcomes of Psychological Distress and Job Withdrawal Behaviour than Life Satisfaction. Thus, the organisational restructuring appeared to have a greater association with work-specific outcomes rather than non-work outcomes. Some limitations of the research are noted. For example, the small sample size limited the ability to use latent variable model testing procedures. Second, the conclusions from the research studies are applicable to a police service organisation and thus may be limited in their application to employees in other organisations. Third, the model focused quite heavily on the individual within the organisation, examining personal resources and characteristics. Nonetheless, this research has contributed to the literature in several ways by: (a) developing a theoretically founded measure of valued job characteristics, (b) demonstrating the importance of evaluating changes to these features of the work environment and the potential loss of the job during organisational instability, and (c) testing an appraisal, coping and adaptation model that shows much promise for use within organisations undergoing crisis or change. This newly developed and tested model appears especially useful in understanding the impact of organisation changes on work related outcomes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Police Service</field><field name="subject">job security</field><field name="subject">organisational change</field><field name="subject">cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion</field><field name="subject">work environment</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070219.115614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing the Dynamics of a Textually Mediated Community of Practice: The Social Construction of Literacy in the Business Faculty</field><field name="creator">Baskin, Colin</field><field name="description">This study is positioned within existing debates about the meaning and role of academic literacy, how it shapes and then frames the academic and professional writing practices of business students. It explores relationships between literacy, individual writers and the academy. It goes beyond merely locating these relationships, pointing more to the need to understand how particular student and staff groups within the faculty describe academic writing practices, and in turn act upon these descriptions. Current formulations of academic literacy reflect a heavy emphasis by academic and professional communities on the commodity value of 'literacy skills'. This happens despite the fact that not much is known about the details and current culture of literacy practices in Australian universities, and how these are inflected by different disciplinary areas and cross-cultural factors. Given the divergent applications of literacy that exist across the business professions, there remains a distinct lack of consensus over the meaning of literacy in business higher education communities. Institutional responses reflect this lack of consensus, and are expressed as inflections around a perceived 'crisis' in tertiary literacy standards. Business and professional faculties, while simultaneously embracing the economic and policy imperative underlying mass education, are seen to remain scornful of the service obligation this brings. Implicit in current understandings of academic literacy are the taken for granted connections between basic literacy, reading and writing, schooling, education and employment. These connections underwrite the relations of institutional arrangements, everyday practices, policy construction, and the conditions for student evaluation in the faculty. This study begins from where literacy is located 'bodily', and provides in the first instance a content analysis which explicates and presents student discussions on various ways of thinking about, framing and reframing academic writing. The project then turns to contemporary literacy theory for an explanation of how a community discourse of 'academic literacy' is conceived, produced and in turn reproduced. Contemporary literacy theory has embraced three theoretical frameworks in its move away from a traditional uni-dimensional view of literacy, namely critical social theories, discourse and textual studies, and ethnographic research methodologies (Smith 1988). This trinity of frameworks is used in the second instance to examine a series of interviews with student writers. This data makes visible the means by which institutions value certain literacy practices over others, practices which support the naturalized world of writing required by the faculty and its professional communities. Dominant literacy practices are identified, and interpretive procedures from the field of Ethnomethodology are used to account for the ways in which discourses on academic writing both reflect and produce social and community realities. Theories of discourse are used to examine the social construction of student writing practices within this local faculty community by identifying the attributes and assumptions that are attached to different community members to account for aspects of writing practice. The key to understanding academic literacy practices is found in explication of the social processes and practices that organise the 'everyday' world of the business faculty. This project discloses how the subjective world of academic literacy is organised, and how this form of organisation is articulated 'to the social relations of the larger social and economic process' (Smith 1988:152).  In the strict context of this study, this means being able to disclose for certain groups of student writers, how their situations and literacy practices are organised and determined by social processes outside the scope of their 'everyday' world. This process of discovery requires the researched to actively construct 'local' referents as categories and concepts which, when applied to a faculty context, can form an observable, local practice as a dialectic 'between what members do in tending the categories and concepts of (an) institutional ideology' on academic writing (Smith 1988:161).  The interpretive practices students use to analyse literacy practices bring academic literacy into being. The outcomes of the study show that the relationships between literacy, the individual and the academy are currently explained and understood in terms of the connections that can be made between existing professional and academic community discourses. Here the concept of a 'literacy crisis' resides. It is expressed through informant talk as a perceived fall in academic literacy standards. Informant debate on what has caused this decline is generally expressed through two key positions. One of these holds a rhetorical view of literacy as a somewhat natural and procedural outcome of the higher educational process, positioning literacy within an oppositional framework of deficit cultural and linguistic models. A second view evokes a competitive agenda of limited and limiting academic and professional opportunities. Behind these arguments and their rebuttals, lie assumptions about the 'literate' person as a member of the faculty. In arguing that research into the field of academic literacy has concealed a student sub-text, this study argues that literacy has been constructed, implemented and investigated from the perspective of the institution. It follows that academic literacy can be better understood as a socially constructed and signifying space, one which includes opportunities for students to create their own powerful identities as writers and as members of professional and faculty communities. This project bridges many aspects of student experience, with the major focus upon that which has been excluded by the absence of students from the making of the topics and the relevance of the discourse. For this compelling reason, this project has direct relevance to teachers, researchers, fieldworkers and policy-makers involved in the overlapping fields of literacy and higher education.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tertiary literacy</field><field name="subject">academic literacy</field><field name="subject">discourse and textual studies</field><field name="subject">critical social theory</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20021219.151517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Just Practice? Towards a Theory of Professional Education That Uses the Workplace as Context</field><field name="creator">Bates, Merrelyn</field><field name="description">Universities are becoming more accountable for their own funding and for establishing their own societal relevance. As Governments respond to the demands of industry and commerce to fit graduates for the workplace, universities are being asked to provide students with the knowledge and skills for learning and working in an ever-changing workplace. There is a strong implication here that the traditional theory-based learning associated with higher education needs to be augmented (and complemented) by an experiential component that enables students to develop a 'feel' for the workplace and 'an instinct' for what they are likely to be doing when they are working. Demands for such a change are not only coming from industry: students are asking that their university programs be made more 'relevant' to the reality of work rather than merely for the next step in the higher education ladder which requires the 'skills of research'. Recently there has been a strong move throughout the western world towards 'cooperative education' or 'work-integrated education'. Local initiatives at individual institutions are beginning to emphasise the importance of universities developing more symbiotic relationships with the industries in which their graduates are likely to be employed. In Australia, Griffith University has, for example, set up through its Griffith Institute of Higher Education (GIHE) The Griffith Graduate Project, which is attempting to develop an institution-wide policy in this area so that a concerted and coordinated response can be made. As convenor of a Griffith University workplace-based experiential course in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, I find this study has provided an opportunity to examine the key determinants of success for a workplace-based course and to consider in detail the teaching and learning processes involved. The aim was to examine the fine-grained processes underlying the construction of new knowledge as students accommodate to the demands placed upon them. The methodology adopted was based on an interpretive constructivist paradigm and addressed a number of questions that considered the roles of the different stakeholders in a specific workplace-based course, the formal and informal expectations held of them, and the role-conflicts these stakeholders tended to experience. This meant that the basic process followed was inductive rather than deductive, worked from the specific to the general and required a methodology that did the same. Because the nature of the work in criminal justice agencies often must deal with feelings and emotion, it was assumed that the students' emotional responses could affect their learning so the methodology allowed for the subjective interpretations and responses (both appropriate and inappropriate) made by all stakeholders and the data was collected as verbatim reports of both factual reports and feeling responses. These were then analysed according to the students' own reports of learning and key principles of procedure for the design and implementation of such courses across the career spectrum were extracted. The values and approaches of action research were central to the responsive case study methodology that was developed. The study found that at its best, the course was conducted according to principles that enabled the student to experience an intuitive 'felt reality' while still making decisions on a strong cognitive base. The acquisition of knowledge appeared to depend on transactions that occurred between teacher and learner, supervisor and student in the workplace milieu. The thesis concludes with a number of recommendations and implications for developing best practice in the field. Ways in which the findings may be incorporated into university policy are also considered, as are the implications for change in the design, conduct and teaching of university professional studies courses.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Experiential learning</field><field name="subject">theory-based learning</field><field name="subject">work-integrated education</field><field name="subject">cooperative education</field><field name="subject">professional education</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060112.141825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Undoing Big Daddy Art: Subverting the Fathers of Western Art Through a Metaphorical and Mythological Father/Daughter Relationship</field><field name="creator">Batorowicz, Beata Agnieszka</field><field name="description">The canon of Western art history provides a selection of artists that have supposedly made an 'original' contribution to stylistic innovation within the visual arts. Although a process of selection cannot be avoided, this procedure has resulted in a Eurocentric and patriarchal art canon. For example, the Western art canon consists of certain white male artists who are given exclusive authority and are often referred to as the 'fathers of art'. As the status of a 'father of art' pertains to the highest level of achievement within artistic creativity, I argue that this excellence in creativity is based on a gender specific criteria. This issue refers to the patrilineage within Western  art history and how this father-son model, in a general sense, excludes women artists from the canon. Further, the very few women included in the art canon are not given the equivalent status as a 'father of art'. I address this patriarchal bias through focussing on the father/daughter relationship as a way of challenging the patrilineage within Western art history&#146;s patrilineage. Through this process of intervention, I position the daughter an assertive figure who directly confronts the fathers of Western art. Within this confrontation, I emphasise that the daughter has an assertive identity that is also beyond the father. On this premise my paper is based on the argument that the application of a father/daughter model, within a metaphorical and mythological sense, is useful in subverting the father figures within Western art history. That is, I construct myself as the metaphorical and mythological daughter of the Dada artist, Marcel Duchamp and the Fluxus artist, Joseph Beuys.  As an assertive daughter, I insert myself into the patriarchal framework surrounding these two canonical figures in order to decentre and subvert their authority and phallocentric art practice. It is important to note that both Duchamp and Beuys are addressed as case studies (not as individual arguments) that illustrate the patriarchal constructs of the art canon. Within this premise, I draw upon the female artists Sherrie Levine and Jana Sterbak who directly subvert Western father figures as examples of assertive daughter identities. Within this exploration of the assertive daughter identity, I discuss feminist psychoanalysis (particularly the 'object relations' theorist Nancy Chodorow and the French feminist, Luce Irigaray) in order to offer metaphorical representations of the assertive daughter. These metaphors also assist in subverting the gender (male) specific criteria for creativity under the 'law of the father'.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western art canon</field><field name="subject">patriarchy</field><field name="subject">patriarchal bias</field><field name="subject">gender studies</field><field name="subject">artists</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">Joseph Beuys</field><field name="subject">Marcel Duchamp</field><field name="subject">Sherrie Levine</field><field name="subject">Jana Sterbak</field><field name="subject">feminist art history</field><field name="subject">feminist psychoanalysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040319.090547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Handling Over-Constrained Temporal Constraint Networks</field><field name="creator">Beaumont, Matthew</field><field name="description">Temporal reasoning has been an active research area for over twenty years, with most work focussing on either enhancing the efficiency of current temporal reasoning algorithms or enriching the existing algebras. However, there has been little research into handling over-constrained temporal problems except to recognise that a problem is over-constrained and then to terminate. As many real-world temporal reasoning problems are inherently over-constrained, particularly in the scheduling domain, there is a significant need for approaches that can handle over-constrained situations. In this thesis, we propose two backtracking algorithms to gain partial solutions to over-constrained temporal problems. We also propose a new representation, the end-point ordering model, to allow the use of local search algorithms for temporal reasoning. Using this model we propose a constraint weighting local search algorithm as well as tabu and random-restart algorithms to gain partial solutions to over-constrained temporal problems. Specifically, the contributions of this thesis are: The introduction and empirical evaluation of two backtracking algorithms to solve over-constrained temporal problems. We provide two backtracking algorithms to close the gap in current temporal research to solve over-constrained problems; The representation of temporal constraint networks using the end-point ordering model. As current representation models are not suited for local search algorithms, we develop a new model such that local search can be applied efficiently to temporal reasoning; The development of a constraint weighting local search algorithm for under-constrained problems. As constraint weighting has proven to be efficient for solving many CSP problems, we implement a constraint weighting algorithm to solve under-constrained temporal problems; An empirical evaluation of constraint weighting local search against traditional backtracking algorithms. We compare the results of a constraint weighting algorithm with traditional backtracking approaches and find that in many cases constraint weighting has superior performance; The development of a constraint weighting local search, tabu search and random-restart local search algorithm for over-constrained temporal problems. We extend our constraint weighting algorithm to solve under-constrained temporal problems as well as implement two other popular local search algorithms: tabu search and random-restart; An empirical evaluation of all three local search algorithms against the two backtracking algorithms. We compare the results of all three local search algorithms with our twobacktracking algorithms for solving over-constrained temporal reasoning problems and find that local search proves to be considerably superior.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">temporal reasoning</field><field name="subject">over-constrained temporal networks</field><field name="subject">over-constrained temporal problems</field><field name="subject">algorithm</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="subject">scheduling</field><field name="subject">network</field><field name="subject">networks</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041213.084512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships among Knowledge Creation, Diffusion and Utilisation in the CRC Process</field><field name="creator">Beesley, Lisa</field><field name="description">Tourism has come to be recognised as a major contributor to national economies.  In a knowledge-based economy (that emphasises the benefits of industry/government and academic research), a strong research base must underpin management of a tourist destination if it is to realise its full potential.  The establishment of collaborative networks between industry, academia, and government in the strategic planning and management of cities and towns is becoming increasingly popular.  However, the way in which the processes underlying these settings facilitate or inhibit eventual outcomes is poorly understood. If knowledge is to drive innovation and economic growth optimally, it is important not just to develop an understanding of the processes underlying the creation, diffusion and utilisation of knowledge in cooperative research settings, but also the relationships among them.  Accordingly, the aim of this investigation is to examine the relationships among knowledge creation, diffusion and utilisation occurring in the Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) Program, specifically, the Gold Coast Visioning Project, with a view to identifying the most efficient means for formulating and disseminating research designed for industry and/or government application. Knowledge is defined as information that is imbued with meaning or relevance.  However, this definition says little of the ways that individuals, groups and organisations acquire knowledge.  While cognitive psychologists have produced several theories suggesting the structure and mechanisms of individual cognitive processes underlying the acquisition and use of knowledge, social scientists have sought to describe and explain the process by investigating the influence of social factors.  Recent contributions to group learning have examined group composition, group size, familiarity among group members, and communication processes in an attempt to understand the ways in which groups acquire knowledge.  Research shows that knowledge utilisation in organisations results from the interdependent influences of organisational processes and the control opportunities and control problems that arise through organisational structure.  These frameworks provide accounts of how knowledge is utilised within an organisation, but not of how organisations learn. Recent research suggests that organisations learn through knowledge networks where organisational focus moves from the consideration and protection of boundaries to the management of (and care for) relationships.  Therefore, organisations contain static (rules, norms and procedures) and dynamic (social relationships) elements that mutually influence the degree to which organisations learn.  A synthesis of the available literature resulted in the development of a series of models that served not only to inform, but also be informed by the analysis of this investigation.  A single case study, namely the Gold Coast Visioning Project, was used to examine the ways in which knowledge was created, disseminated and utilised in a CRC setting.  This ethnographic investigation considered the process of knowledge creation through to utilisation at individual, group, organisational, and inter-organisational levels, while simultaneously examining the interrelated influences of social, cognitive, affective and communication factors.  Throughout the project, data were collected through stakeholder interviews, various documents and participant observation of stakeholder meetings and workshops.  Data were analysed using a grounded theory approach and methods of thick description. The results show that researchers and industry stakeholders bring different frames of reference, different expectations, and different knowledge bases to the exercise.  This inhibited communication, and gave the appearance of dissension when, in fact, what was being sought was a common frame for understanding and communication.  Additionally, the gap between industry and researcher worldviews generated the sense that industry was resisting or failing to understand what the research was seeking to achieve.  Consequently, in order to manage the relationship, research plans and findings were communicated to industry in a teacher-to-student fashion, which fostered single-loop learning, and reduced industry stakeholders' sense of ownership in the process and findings.  During the project, industry stakeholders frequently sought to have research come pre-packaged with "meaning", but researchers lacked the contextual knowledge necessary to specify the relevance of their research.  The results also show that research findings need to be integrated and diffused to industry over time, and specific applications need to be formulated (and reformulated) in response to particular and changing needs of industry.  As a result of this investigation, a model of 'best practice' has been developed with detailed recommendations for the design, implementation, and reporting of CRC-sponsored research to optimise its utility for end-users of such research.  From a theoretical perspective, the findings of this study challenge the ways that current theories account for the ways in which knowledge is acquired and utilised since the results show that knowledge is constructed both socially and emotionally.  Any investigation that seeks to understand how knowledge is acquired and utilised must consider social and affective influences.  To ignore the role of emotion and values in the process of knowledge acquisition is to ignore a key component of an individual's reasoning capacity.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CRC</field><field name="subject">CRCs</field><field name="subject">Cooperative Research Centre</field><field name="subject">Cooperative Research Centres</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">knowledge acquisition</field><field name="subject">knowledge utilisation</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">organization</field><field name="subject">organizations</field><field name="subject">organisations</field><field name="subject">organisational</field><field name="subject">organizational</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast Visioning Project</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040901.125713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re:Collections - Collection Motivations and Methodologies as Imagery, Metaphor and Process in Contemporary Art</field><field name="creator">Berry, Jessica</field><field name="description">By the 1990's many modes of artwork incorporated the constructs of the museum. Art forms including, 'ethnographic art', 'museum interventions', 'museum fictions' and 'artist museums' were considered to be located in similar realms to each other. These investigations into this emerging 'genre' of collection-art have primarily focussed upon the critique of the public museum and its grand-narratives. This thesis will attempt to recognise that the critique of institutional hierarchical systems is now considered integral to much collection art and extends this enquiry to incorporate private collections which examine the narratives of everyday existence. This paper adopts an interdisciplinary approach to material culture and art criticism in examining everyday objects within contemporary collection-art. In this context, this paper argues that: the investigation of collection motivations (fetish, souvenir and system) as metaphor, process and imagery in conjunction with the mimicking of museology methodologies (classification, order and display) is an effective model for interpreting everyday objects within contemporary collection-art. In formulating this argument, this paper examines the ways in which artists emulate museology methodologies in order to convey cultural significance for everyday objects. This is explored in conjunction with the employment of collection motivations by artists as a device to understand elements of human/object relations. In doing so, it contemplates the convergence between the practices of museums and collection-artists. These issues are explored through the visual and analytic investigations of key artist case studies including: Damien Hirst, Sylvie Fleury, Mike Kelley, Christian Boltanski, On Kawara, Luke Roberts, Jason Rhoades, Karsten Bott and Elizabeth Gower. In doing so, this paper argues that the everyday objects of collection-art can represent a broad range of socio/cultural concerns, so delineating a closer relationship between collection-art and material culture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collection art</field><field name="subject">ethnographic art</field><field name="subject">museum interventions</field><field name="subject">museum fictions</field><field name="subject">artist museums</field><field name="subject">collection motivations</field><field name="subject">contemporary art</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070327.151934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community Control Theory and Practice: a Case Study of the Brisbane Aboriginal and Islander Community Health Service</field><field name="creator">Best, Odette Michel</field><field name="description">It is accepted protocol among Indigenous communities to identify one's link to land. I was born and raised in Brisbane. My birth grandmother is a Goreng Goreng woman, my birth grandfather is a Punthamara man. However, I was adopted by a Koombumberri man and an anglo-celtic mother after being removed at birth under the Queensland government policy of the day. The action of my removal and placement has had profound effects upon my growing and my place within my community today. For the last 15 years I have worked in the health sector. My current position is as a Lecturer within the Department of Nursing, Faculty of Science, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba. My areas of expertise are Indigenous Health and Primary Health Care. I have been employed in this capacity since January 2000. Prior to my full time employment as a nursing academic I have primarily been located within three areas of health which have directly impacted upon my current research. I was first positioned within health by undertaking my General Nurse Certificate through hospital-based training commenced in the late 1980s. For me this training meant being immersed within whiteness and specifically the white medical model. This meant learning a set of skills in a large institutionalised health care service with the provision of doctors, nurses, and allied medical staff through a hospital. Within this training there was no Indigenous health curriculum. The lectures provided on 'differing cultures' and health were on Muslim and Hindu beliefs about death. At that point I was painfully aware of the glaring omission of any representation of Indigenous health and of acknowledgment of the current outstanding health differentials between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I knew that the colonisation process inflicted upon Indigenous Australians was one of devastation. The decline in our health status at the time of colonisation had been felt immediately. Since this time our health has been in decline. While in the 1980s it was now no longer acceptable to shoot us, poison our waterholes, and incarcerate us on missions, we were still experiencing the influence of the colonisation process, which had strong repercussions for our current health status. Our communities were and remain rife with substance abuse, violence, unemployment, and much more. For Indigenous Australians these factors cannot be separated from our initial experience of the colonisation process but are seen as the continuation of it. However, there was no representation of this and I received my first health qualification.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brisbane Aboriginal and Islander Community Health Service</field><field name="subject">Indigenous health services</field><field name="subject">primary health services for Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060529.144246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Electronic Spectroscopy of Neutral and Ionic Clusters</field><field name="creator">Bieske, Evan John</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with weakly bound neutral and ionic clusters. Spectra of the region near the S1fS0 electronic origin of four neutral van der Waals molecules - aniline-argon, phenol-argon, chlorobenzene-argon and fluorobenzene-argon - were obtained using resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI). These spectra indicate that Fermi resonances between van der Waals stretching and bending motions are important in these molecules. Effective Hamiltonians are constructed that describe well the low frequency vibrations. In order to better discuss the low frequency van der Waals motions of aromatics bound to one and two rare gas atoms a simple model for the vibrations is developed. The model enables expression of van der Waals frequencies in terms of fundamental molecular properties and enables facile comparison of effective force constants in a variety of van der Waals molecules. The model is successfully employed to explain van der Waals vibrational structure associated with the origin region of aniline-(argon)2 using van der Waals potential parameters derived from the aniline-(argon)1 spectrum. REMPI and emission spectra of larger clusters of aniline and argon are also reported and discussed. Using atom-atom potentials, equilibrium structures for aniline-(argon)n (n=l, 2, 3) are calculated. The calculations prove useful in the analysis of the spectra.The BfX transitions of the cation complexes fluorobenzene+-argon and chlorobenzene+-argon have been investigated. The cations were prepared by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization of the neutral van der Waals molecules. A time delayed tunable dye laser was then used to dissociate the cations, loss of an argon atom being the dominant process. When the second laser was tuned to a cation resonance the dissociation cross section increased markedly, allowing characterization of BfX transition. The resulting spectra are presented and discussed.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">neutral clusters</field><field name="subject">ionic clusters</field><field name="subject">van der Waals frequencies</field><field name="subject">Hamiltonians</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051109.112502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entrepreneurs: Interrelationships Between Their Characteristics, Values, Expectations, Management Practices and SME Performance</field><field name="creator">Blackman, Alan John</field><field name="description">This original research seeks to identify unique predictive relationships between the characteristics, values and expectations of entrepreneurs in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and the management practices they choose; and then, the relationships between those practices and business performance. It adds to the current understanding of the impact of entrepreneurs on the performance of their businesses and has also led to the development of two new tools for assessing the performance of SMEs.  Growth of the SME sector is important to the public policy agendas of governments, like those in Australia, that are seeking to optimise the employment opportunities associated with an SME sector in which "success" is the norm because SME failure, or underperformance, is associated with many social costs; costs that include reduced earnings for proprietors, potential job loss for staff and financial hardship for suppliers, as well as a reduction in the average per capita spending power of the community in which the failed or under performing business is based.  For the SME, business strategy development and implementation is often the role of the entrepreneur owner-manager. The characteristics, values and expectations of entrepreneurs in SMEs may thus influence their choice of management practices and thereby the performance of their businesses. As Cooper (1998) argued: "the primary motivations of the entrepreneur bear upon not only the decision to start but also upon the decisions about how to manage, including whether or not to grow the firm aggressively" (p. 247). Johnson (1990) suggested that there is a strong need to focus future research on the motivation mechanisms of entrepreneurs as drivers of the entrepreneurial process. Johnson's view supports the entrepreneurial trait school of thought that development of an understanding of the individual entrepreneur's characteristics, values and expectations might provide worthwhile insight into her or his behaviour and its relationship to SME success and failure.  The purposes of this research, therefore, were, first, to determine the importance of the attributed and attained characteristics of the entrepreneur on the formation of his or her values and expectations; second, to determine the influence of those values and expectations on the choice of management practices; third, to determine the degree to which those management practices influence business performance; and last, to develop a scale of measurement for entrepreneur characteristics, values and expectations that can be used to predict business performance. To enable limited comparison with Kotey's and Meredith's (1997) findings and to control for between industry and between state influences, the chosen context for the research was the furniture industry in Queensland. To add to current knowledge in SME management practices and performance, two new measurement tools were developed for this research. The first quantifies the positiveness of the business intentions of the entrepreneur. The second is a scaled index of perceived performance that takes account of the importance given by an entrepreneur to eight common business objectives and the degree to which he or she is satisfied with the performance of the business for each objective. Both tools are important additions to the limited existing armoury of tools available to researchers seeking to understand and predict SME performance.  For the first time, the findings of this research indicate negative relationships between parent occupation skill levels and the importance given by entrepreneurs to the values of responsibility, honesty and competence and the negative role of the entrepreneur's achieved highest qualification on the importance given to values of affection, compassion, religion and national security. The findings thereby highlight the important role played by an entrepreneur's attained characteristics on the formation of his or her values. As well, the results show the important role played by values such as power and responsibility, as well as by high internal locus of control, on an entrepreneur's selection of planning, marketing and future management practices. In turn, the impact of those practices on business performance, as measured by the overall satisfaction of the entrepreneur and the newly created Scaled Index of Perceived Performance, is demonstrated. In so doing, the results shed more light on the complex relationships between entrepreneurs, the management practices they choose, and business performance. For the furniture industry in Queensland, the findings confirm Cooper's (1998) view that there is an empirical relationship between business founding processes and the performance of the business. Also supported is Kotey's and Meredith's (1997) broad finding for the furniture industry in New South Wales that "personal values of owner/managers, the strategies they adopt in operating their firms, and the performance outcomes of their businesses are empirically related" (1997, p. 59). Future research is needed to develop a causal model for those relationships in a variety of SME and other contexts.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SME</field><field name="subject">SMEs</field><field name="subject">small-medium enterprises</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurs</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurial</field><field name="subject">business</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">managing</field><field name="subject">manager</field><field name="subject">managers</field><field name="subject">owner-managers</field><field name="subject">values</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040615.154732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Computer Model of Creativity Based on Perceptual Activity Theory</field><field name="creator">Blain, Peter J</field><field name="description">Perception and mental imagery are often thought of as processes that generate internal representations, but proponents of perceptual activity theory say they are better thought of as guided exploratory activities. The omission of internal representations in the perceptual activity account has led some to see it as computationally implausible. This thesis clarifies perceptual activity theory from a computational perspective, and tests its viability using a computer model called PABLO. The computer model operates in the Letter Spirit domain, which is a framework for creating stylistic variations on the lowercase letters of the Roman alphabet. PABLO is unlike other computer models of perception and mental imagery because it does not use data-structures to represent percepts and mental images. Mental contents are instead modelled in terms of the exploratory activity in which perceptual activity theory says they consist. PABLO also models the flexibility of imagery, and simulates how it can be harnessed and exploited by the system to generate a creative product. PABLO is a first attempt at an implementation of perceptual activity theory, but the results suggest that the theory is computationally viable, and that it has advantages over other theories of mental imagery in the context of creativity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">perceptual activity theory</field><field name="subject">computational perspective</field><field name="subject">PABLO</field><field name="subject">Letter Spirit domain</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070823.171325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the Role of Thioredoxin in the Invasive Phenotype and its Interaction with the Transcription Factor Sp1</field><field name="creator">Bloomfield, Kelly Louise</field><field name="description">Thioredoxin is a small ubiquitous oxido-reductase found in all species.  The highly conserved active site, which facilitates thioredoxins redox activity, contains two redox active cysteine residues.  Thioredoxin has numerous protein substrates to which it donates H+ ions and it can also function as a free radical scavenger.  Through these activities thioredoxin is able to influence the redox state of not only its protein targets, but also the entire cellular environment.  Thioredoxin has been implicated in many biological functions, and one mechanism by which it influences these functions is through interactions with a number of transcription factors including NF-kappa-B and p53.  Thioredoxin also has numerous extracellular biological roles.  It has been shown that thioredoxin is actively secreted from a number of normal and transformed cell lines including fibroblasts and activated B and T cells. This study investigates the role of thioredoxin in embryonic implantation and cancer cell metastasis, two physiological functions which rely on the same basic processes.  Thioredoxin expression has previously been shown to be increased in many cancers.  However it has not yet been established whether this increase is a causative or a side effect of the cancerous phenotype.  Similarly thioredoxin expression has previously been shown to be increased during different phases of the oestrus cycle and pregnancy. This thesis describes the role of thioredoxin in embryonic implantation using a marmoset model.  A thioredoxin cDNA was isolated and subsequently sequenced.  Preliminary antibody experiments indicated that the anti human thioredoxin monoclonal antibodies available in our laboratory would recognise marmoset thioredoxin.  Subsequently immunocytochemistry using anti human thioredoxin antibodies was carried out on sectioned marmoset uterus and embryonic tissue.  The results indicated that thioredoxin is expressed by cells at the embryonic-maternal interface of early implantation sites.  Further studies demonstrated that thioredoxin is also expressed and secreted by cultured blastocysts in vitro.  This thesis also describes the role of thioredoxin in cancer cell metastasis.  Results of this study indicate that thioredoxin is actively involved in facilitating the invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells.  The two cell lines utilised were MCF-7, a well differentiated, relatively non-invasive breast cancer cell line; and MDA-MB-231, a poorly differentiated, highly invasive breast cancer cell line.  The cell lines were transfected with thioredoxin sense, antisense and 1SS (encodes thioredoxin with both active cysteine residues mutated to serine residues and is thus redox inactive) constructs. The results demonstrate that when endogenous thioredoxin levels are increased, i.e. transfected with a sense thioredoxin construct, the invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 becomes more invasive, conversely when endogenous levels are decreased, i.e. transfected with antisense or 1SS constructs, the invasive capacity of these cells decreases.  However, when the endogenous level of thioredoxin was manipulated in the relatively non-invasive cell line MCF-7 very little effect was observed.  Results also indicate that thioredoxin has the ability to act as a chemoattractant for actively invading breast cancer cells.  Both of these functions appear to be dependent on thioredoxin's redox activity.  Additional studies described in this thesis have shown that thioredoxin is involved in the regulation of Sp1 in vitro.  Sp1 is a transcription factor known to regulate the transcription of a number of genes whose products are intimately involved in the invasive phenotype.  The results in this study suggest that Sp1 DNA binding is regulated by thioredoxin such that when reduced by the enzyme its binding to DNA is facilitated.  Results also indicate that Sp1 may regulate the transcription of thioredoxin by binding to Sp1 sites within the thioredoxin promoter.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thioredoxin</field><field name="subject">genetic transcription factors</field><field name="subject">embryonic implantation</field><field name="subject">cancer cell metastasis</field><field name="subject">marmoset</field><field name="subject">marmosets</field><field name="subject">phenotype</field><field name="subject">phenotypes</field><field name="subject">invasive phenotype</field><field name="subject">invasive phenotypes</field><field name="subject">Sp1</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031021.120018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of Students' Experiences of Learning in Higher Education</field><field name="creator">Bond, Carol Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the development of tertiary students' experiences of learning as they progress through three years of undergraduate study in two different psychology programs. Previous research that is relevant to this topic has tended to focus either more narrowly on the development of epistemic beliefs or more broadly on the variation of learners' experiences of learning. Research on epistemic beliefs has tended to focus on the structural aspects (stages) of development and to ignore the content of thinking. In contrast, research on experiences of learning has concentrated upon the content of students' experiences, yet it can be criticised for the way in which it decontextualises students' experiences and for its limited attention to change and development. Moreover, despite evidence suggesting that learning comprises a complex of phenomena such as understanding, memorising and knowing, this line of research has tended to treat learning as a single phenomenon. In the thesis I draw on Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics, Gurwitsch's view of awareness, and much of the conceptual framework of the phenomenographic perspective to argue a case for a theoretical framework and consequential practices that are more plural and inclusive of learner's experiences of learning. The new approach refocuses the relationship between researcher, knower and known in terms of the knowing relation-one that involves a dynamic iterative interweaving of first and second order perspectives. Using this new approach, students' experiences are analysed to provide rich description and ontological explanation of both change and development over time. The approach allows the unity of the partlwholelpart relation of an individual's experience to be recognised. So the method is able to take account of the contextual relevancy of the individual whilst also focusing on the experiences of the group. The results show that rather than comprising a single phenomenon, learning is itself part of a multi-dimensional (depth, spatial and temporal dimensions), multi-phenomenal field. The phenomena of learning, understanding, memorising and knowledge are described in detail, and their individual internal relations are elaborated along with the internal relations between the phenomena. Four main groups of experiences of learning are described within this framework: reproductive experiences; relational experiences; constructive experiences; and transformative experiences. Each of these categories comprises several sub- categories. This fine-grained focus on individual students' data, and the use of the phenomenographic whadhow framework, allows the development of experiences to be traced and interpreted as a gradual morphing over time. The pattern of development suggests that each part of the learners' journey plays an important role in the growth of skill and competence in learning. Thus, it may be important that curricula account for variation not by focussing upon transformative experiences of learning, as is often the case, but by facilitating shifts through all of the experiences that learners may pass through.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tertiary students</field><field name="subject">experiences of learning</field><field name="subject">H.

In this program of research two studies were conducted.  The first study was to investigate the variables that put couples at risk for developing a combination of relationship and alcohol problems.  The second study was an evaluation of the effects of an integrated education program that promoted safe drinking and positive relationship interaction.  Previous research shows that deficits in negative affect regulation and poor communication predict the onset of both relationship and alcohol problems. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that deficits in communication exist in couples in which one or both partners drink at hazardous levels. In Study 1 communication of 85 couples (53 couples with no high-risk drinker and 32 couples with at least one at-risk drinker) in early stage committed relationships was assessed by observation of their interaction. Couples in which the man was drinking at hazardous levels had significantly more negative communication than couples without an at-risk drinker.  In Study 2, 37 couples with at least one at-risk drinker were randomly assigned to either Controlling Alcohol and Relationship Enhancement (CARE) or a control condition. Couple communication, alcohol consumption, relationship satisfaction and relationship stability were assessed at pre- and post-intervention. Alcohol consumption, relationship satisfaction and relationship stability were also assessed at 6-month follow-up. Couples receiving CARE improved their communication significantly relative to the control couples. Couples in both conditions showed significant reductions in hazardous drinking, but there was no significant difference in the effects of the interventions on alcohol consumption.  The program of research demonstrates that deficits in couple communication are evident in couples with hazardous male drinking, even in the early stage of the relationship when the couples report high relationship satisfaction. The communication deficits are remedied with brief, skill-training relationship education. Furthermore, there was evidence for the effects of CARE on reduction of steps towards relationship dissolution at 6-month follow-up. The brief alcohol component of the intervention showed little benefit beyond the control condition in terms of impact upon the alcohol problems. This research is the first to demonstrate that a combined program of skill-based relationship education and strategies for alcohol reduction is effective in remediating communication skills deficits in the early stage relationships of couples with hazardous alcohol consumption. Future research can extend this work to enable the development of programs which match the content of relationship education to the specific needs of other high-risk couples.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alcohol use</field><field name="subject">alcohol abuse</field><field name="subject">alcoholism</field><field name="subject">alocholic</field><field name="subject">alcoholics</field><field name="subject">problem drinking</field><field name="subject">couple</field><field name="subject">couples</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">relationship</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">CARE</field><field name="subject">Controlling Alcohol and Relationship Enhancement program</field><field name="subject">relationship education</field><field name="subject">counseling</field><field name="subject">counselling</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040322.092510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Job Strain and Healthy Work in Teachers: a Test of the Demands-Control-Support Model</field><field name="creator">Bradley, Graham</field><field name="description">Over the past two decades, research into worker well-being has been greatly influenced by the demands-control-support models of Robert Karasek (1979; Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990).  These models propose that worker strain and active learning are determined by particular combinations of job demands, job control and social support.  Specifically, incumbents of jobs that are high in demands, low in control, and low in support are expected to show high levels of strain, whilst incumbents of jobs that are high in all three job factors are expected to display high levels of activity, learning and participation, both on and off the job.  The models also propose that prolonged exposure to combinations of these job conditions influence workers' accumulated anxiety and sense of mastery.  If empirically substantiated, Karasek's models have profound implications for the design of "healthy work" environments. This thesis represents an attempt to clarify, critically evaluate, extend and test Karasek's models.  Self-report data, as well as information obtained from a collateral source, are used to assess the independent linear, quadratic, additive and interactive effects of Karasek's job factors.  Multivariate models of the direct and indirect relationships between the job factors and a range of possible antecedents and consequences are proposed and submitted to empirical test.  Two major, and several minor, studies, all using samples of school teachers, are reported. The first major study used a cross-sectional design, and self-report measures of demands, control and job stressors to predict several indices of worker strain (e.g., stress, job dissatisfaction, somatic complaints).  Analyses of data from 421 teachers revealed independent and additive effects of demands and control on strain, but few quadratic or interactive effects.  Demands and control also predicted job stressfulness, with additional evidence showing that the effects of demands on this outcome were buffered by perceived job control. The second major study tested Karasek's models using a two-wave full panel design, and an expanded set of predictor, moderating and outcome variables.  Data were collected from 987 teachers, as well as from a significant other person nominated by the majority of these teachers.  Demands, control and social support were shown to predict stressors and strain, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Results generally confirmed Karasek's additive strain hypotheses.  Consistent evidence of interactive effects of the job factors on strain was not found in the full sample of teachers, but was obtained when analyses were limited to a sub-sample of new-start workers.  Relationships between the job factors and measures of worker activity and participation were also found.  However, rather than all three job factors acting conjunctively, demands and support from supervisors predicted some outcomes (e.g., the number of hours teachers worked), control and support from co-workers predicted other outcomes (e.g., self- and other-reported levels of vigour-activity), whilst a further set of indices (e.g., participation in organized activities outside of work) were not strongly related to any of the job factors.  Exposure to highly demanding jobs was associated with increases over time in levels of neuroticism, whilst exposure to high control job conditions was associated with increases in levels of mastery.  The demands-mastery relationship was buffered by perceptions of job control.  Limited support was obtained for a set of additional predictions regarding the role of leadership style in shaping job factors, and hence worker strain. In general, the results from this research confirm past findings regarding the effects of job demands, control and social support on strain.  The research makes several important contributions to the literature.  From a research methods viewpoint, new, congruent and specific measures of the job factors, activity-participation outcomes and leadership dimensions were developed.  Also novel was the use of structural equation techniques to test competing longitudinal models that involved continuously-measured interaction terms.  Substantively, the research represents one of most comprehensive investigations yet conducted into Karasek's models.  The test of the dynamic person-environment hypotheses is believed to be unprecedented in the literature, as is the attempt to demonstrate links from leader behaviour, through the job factors, to strain. Implications for Karasek's models include the need to reject the additive hypothesis in relation to activity-participation, and to extend the models to incorporate organizational antecedents of demands, control and support.  More practically, the research reinforces the importance of providing "control-enhancing" opportunities for workers exposed to highly demanding jobs.  Recommendations for future research include the need to test an expanded model of healthy work using multi-wave longitudinal designs, samples of new-start workers, and multiple (including objective) measures of key variables.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Job stress</field><field name="subject">Robert Karasek</field><field name="subject">Teachers</field><field name="subject">Teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050725.125838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contending With Feminism: Women's Health Issues in Margaret Atwood's Early Fiction</field><field name="creator">Braun, Kirsten</field><field name="description">Margaret Atwood's early fiction provides a valuable insight into issues surrounding the establishment of the women's health movement. From The Edible Woman in 1969 to The Handmaid's Tale in 1985, Atwood's work takes up key issues of the movement during this time. Her fiction explores a number of women's health topics including contraception, abortion, birthing, assisted reproductive technologies, eating disorders and breast cancer. Atwood's interest in the appearance of victims in Canadian literature, however, leads to a rejection of the notion that women are fated victims of patriarchal institutions like medicine. This thesis argues that while she does not deny women can be victims, she refuses to accept that this role is inevitable. Foucault's later constructions of power and resistance are explored with the female protagonists refusing to believe their situations are inescapable. Atwood's recognition of her role as a popular fiction writer and her refusal to wear the 'feminist' label allow her the space to critique the women's health movement. Her early fiction exposes the absolutism of the movement and demonstrates its limitations in accounting for women's diversity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Margaret Atwood</field><field name="subject">popular fiction</field><field name="subject">women in literature</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070212.153530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Journalism, Ethics and Accountability: Evaluating the Virtues of Self-Regulation</field><field name="creator">Breit, Rhonda</field><field name="description">This dissertation questions whether the current system of journalistic self-regulation in Australia can give effect to ethical journalism given the conceptual paradigms that have informed its understanding of journalism and journalism ethics. It argues the ideological focus of journalistic self-regulation has constrained the current system's ability to encourage ethical journalism. By taking a grounded theory approach to developing an alternative theory of journalism, this study attempts to fill a void in the reform of journalistic self-regulation in Australia by first highlighting the shortfall in recent reviews. It then argues reform must address the ideological focus of the journalism industry. This means looking at the ideologies espoused in the industry codes. It also means looking at the ideologies that frame how values reflected in the codes are interpreted. In summary, my aim in this dissertation is to articulate a praxis-driven theory of journalism by which to examine the suitability of the Australian self-regulatory environment to give effect to ethical journalism. This will be done by: mapping the current system of journalistic self-regulation; distilling the ideological foci of contemporary interpretations of journalism and journalism ethics; postulating an alternative theory of journalism as practice; evaluating the current system of self-regulation in light of the theory of journalism as practice; and recommending an alternative model of self-regulation that takes account of the theory of journalism as practice. The grounded theory approach to this study involves a textual analysis of a representative sample of self-regulatory codes to identify deficiencies in the way philosophical understandings of identity and ethics have been applied to journalism. By highlighting the gaps in the conceptual paradigm that frames the current theories of journalism and journalism ethics, I offer insights into key problems facing industry self-regulation. Given its grounding in substantive data analysis, the theory developed in this study is able to offer significant insights into ways of improving journalistic self-regulation to encourage ethical journalism. By categorising the self-regulatory codes according to ideology, I aim to explain how core journalistic values can be marginalized. Thus, this study aims to reveal problems with the way in which journalism self-regulation has been conceptualised and operationalised. In this way, it uses the tools of meta-ethics and normative ethics to analyse an ethical problem. Thus the grounded theory emerging from this study falls into the conceptual category of applied ethics. This approach offers a flexible methodology that allows the development of an emergent theory based on raw data derived from the various codes that operate within the journalistic self-regulatory environment. The research problem starts broadly, looking at the ability of the current system of journalistic self-regulation to encourage ethical journalism. The focus of the study is on organizational ideology and conceptions of journalism, rather than individual values of journalists. Through a process of constant comparison I will focus the research problem, constructing a theoretical framework to evaluate whether the current system of journalistic self-regulation can encourage ethical journalism. To achieve these objectives, the study will canvass both process (the ability of self-regulation to give effect to ethical journalism) and action (building a theoretical framework for conceptualising reform). A grounded theory approach offers a way of categorising conceptions of journalism and self-regulation allowing me to develop an alternative theory of journalism that promotes a holistic approach to journalism ethics. This study does not purport to offer final solutions to the ethical problems within Australian journalism. It does, however, aim to present an alternative pathway towards reform of journalistic self-regulation in Australia that focuses on encouraging ethical journalism and expanding the theoretical paradigms that shape current approaches to ethics.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">journalists</field><field name="subject">journalistic</field><field name="subject">ethic</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">ethical</field><field name="subject">self-regulation</field><field name="subject">code</field><field name="subject">codes</field><field name="subject">charter</field><field name="subject">charters</field><field name="subject">conduct</field><field name="subject">principles</field><field name="subject">practice</field><field name="subject">self-regulatory</field><field name="subject">grounded theory</field><field name="subject">values</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040628.102346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Physical Habitat Modification for Mosquito Control, Runnelling, on Selected Non-Target Saltmarsh Resources</field><field name="creator">Breitfuss, Mark</field><field name="description">Runnelling is a popular method of physical habitat modification employed on saltmarshes to control pest mosquito populations.  The runnelling method involves linking the tidal source to isolated mosquito breeding pools via shallow channels that enable slow water movement of low amplitude tides.  Increased tidal flushing inhibits mosquito development.  The range of organisms which inhabit saltmarsh are likely to be influenced by altered tidal conditions as they exhibit specific physicochemical requirements for feeding, burrowing or growth.  The dynamic nature of saltmarsh may mean that changes to the tidal frequency of a particular region of the saltmarsh promotes extension of marine-like conditions. Because runnels increase the frequency of flooding tidal events in specific regions of the saltmarsh this study predicted that resulting changes would be evident in the physical conditions of saltmarsh substrate, in the transport of buoyant vegetative propagules, in the population characteristics of surface grazing snails and in the density and aperture of crab burrows after flooding and non-flooding tidal events. The physical impacts of runnelling were determined at three marshes which appeared similar in terms of topography, substrate and tidal conditions.  Soil water content and consolidation were measured using two sampling protocols: a) comparisons between modified and unmodified shores; and, b) comparisons with increasing lateral distance across the shore from the runnel edge.  At one marsh, moisture levels were significantly higher at runnelled than at unrunnelled sites when tides filled the runnels, but this pattern was not found at the other marshes.  Soil consolidation was greater at higher shore heights, but was not different between runnelled and unrunnelled shores.  Measurements at different lateral distances from runnels demonstrated higher moisture levels and lower consolidation up to 5 m from the edge but not further away. Groups of marked Avicennia marina propagules were released at the three runnelled saltmarshes during flooding and non-flooding tidal events. Groups of propagules released within 10 m of a runnel were always transported significantly further from the starting position and further up the saltmarsh shore after both flooding and non-flooding tides than any other groups.  In addition, the pattern of stranding on saltmarsh for significantly different groups was closely associated with the path of runnel construction so that propagules were located either in the runnel or in depressions linked to the runnel that had been isolated mosquito-breeding pools prior to runnelling. It is likely that altered physical soil conditions significantly affected the distribution and size structures of Salinator solida and Ophicardelus spp. snails recorded at the three saltmarshes.  The interaction of tidal period and the presence of a runnel contributed to patterns with significant differences between runnelled and unrunnelled regions of the marsh.  Generally, the runnel population of snails exhibited flood-like features even during non-flood periods.  The distribution and size classes of snails did not differ with lateral distance from runnels. The burrow characteristics of the crab Helograpsus haswellianus were compared to increase the accuracy of estimating abundance from burrow counts.  Including only those burrows which were obviously maintained by resident crabs significantly increased the confidence limits of estimating crab abundance using only burrow density counts.  This method was applied to runnelled and unrunnelled sites to assess any changes in the density of burrows associated with the presence of runnels.  Again, it is likely that physical soil conditions resulting from increased tidal frequency at the runnel did influence crab burrowing with fewer small burrows being found at the runnelled site, low on the shore.  In addition, mid- and large-sized burrows tended to dominate close to the runnel edge. Site-specific soil characteristics may help to explain the lack of continuity in patterns associated with runnel effects on non-target saltmarsh resources.  While the runnel may increase the soil water content of clayey substrates at some sites it could also result in de-watering of porous sandy soils at other shores.  This was evident in the structure of the snail population and distribution of crab burrows which appeared to reflect altered soil physical characteristics associated with the runnel. Runnelling does affect non-target organisms in saltmarsh.  However, the scale of impact was usually locally restricted (&lt; 10 m from the runnel edge).  The fact that patterns were not recorded at all sites suggests that the influence of runnels is variable and limited by substrate and some biological conditions.  Given the efficiency and popularity of runnelling as a physical control method for reducing pest vector mosquito habitat, this study found no evidence to suggest that its use should be discontinued on any ecological basis measured.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">runnelling</field><field name="subject">intertidal wetlands</field><field name="subject">wetland ecology</field><field name="subject">saltmarsh ecology</field><field name="subject">habitat modification</field><field name="subject">crabs</field><field name="subject">snails</field><field name="subject">mosquitoes</field><field name="subject">mosquito control</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031126.074304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">English Language Immersion: Theorising from Stakeholders' Accounts</field><field name="creator">Bridges, Susan Margaret</field><field name="description">This research is a case study of stakeholders' perceptions of learning and provision during a specific English language program. The pedagogical context of the program was clearly defined. English teachers from Hong Kong who had either Cantonese or Mandarin as their first language (L1) came to Australia for intensive language proficiency training and assessment. The Hong Kong government determined the program's syllabus, including assessment instruments and criteria in the Syllabus Specifications for the Language Proficiency Assessment for Teachers (English Language) (LPATE) (Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), 2000). The Australian provider had created the program from the specifications and had developed appropriate teaching and assessment materials for its implementation in all syllabus components. Additionally, the provider was responsible for administering and marketing the program. Delivery was in immersion mode with the Hong Kong teachers travelling to Australia and residing with Australian 'homestay' families for the 6-week program. The 'guiding issue/question' for the case study was: How did the multiple stakeholders perceive learning and provision? The study drew on a corpus of data collected from the perspectives of various stakeholders within provision of a 6-week in-service and education training program (INSET) (Bolam, 1986) for Chinese first language (L1) primary and secondary school teachers. Stakeholders represented in the study were teachers who participated as learners; the researcher who was a part-time language instructor; a course designer who was a full-time language instructor in the program; and an administrator who also held a wider role in the general marketing of INSET. Multiple forms of data were collected and analysed within a case study design (Stake, 1995, 2000). These included: a document analysis; pretest and posttest questionnaires; semi-structured interviews from individuals and focus groups; stimulated recall interviews from individuals; learner journals; and a researcher journal. Existing knowledge was reviewed through a search of literature, policies and accounts that examined four contextual layers that framed the study and situated it in terms of global, local and intercultural issues. Specifically, the layers were: (a) imperatives for Australian higher education to internationalise; (b) provision of INSET for teachers of English as a Second or Foreign Language (ESL/EFL); (c) language education and proficiency in Hong Kong; and (d) intercultural communication and culture learning as they pertained to an immersion program.  While higher education institutions in Australia have recognised the imperative to internationalise, some recent initiatives are poorly researched. Bodycott and Crew (2001a, p. 23) noted a 'dearth' (p. 2) of literature surrounding short-term, immersion versions of INSET such as that used in the current research.  A review of literature where INSET had been used for the education of language teachers provided important insights into issues that might affect learning and provision. These involved the extent to which teachers' home country contexts were included in the design and content of programs, whether 'one-off' programs could be effective in the long-term, and what models underpinned the current design of INSET. The major gaps in the literature were (a) reported research on INSET where it is delivered as a short-term, immersion program to South East Asian teachers; and (b) published work on the LPATE as a learning-teaching experience. The current study attempted to address these gaps. While there was an absence of literature on the specific context of the INSET under study, the literature did reveal ways for the teacher/researcher to objectify and reflect on INSET provision. Literature on interactionism and social constructivism provided insights into the role and effect of the teacher/researcher in a data-gathering process. The case study approach was reviewed and Stake's (1995, 2000) design used in the study within a theoretical framework of social constructivism. In its reporting, the case accounts for forces of change surrounding the participants' INSET. These included the internationalisation of Australian higher education and curriculum reform in Hong Kong. At more personal levels, participants provided reflective data throughout the immersion experience. These data from the Hong Kong teachers indicated perceptions of strong positive growth in their English proficiency. This is an outcome consistent with the purpose of the INSET, which was to improve and benchmark proficiency standards. The data also revealed that the teachers had learned much about pedagogy and culture, which formed insights into intercultural negotiation and learning. The providers - an administrator and an instructor - supported accounts their learners had given of learning and provision. Yet, each had particular views regarding what constituted success in delivery of an INSET. While the case study provided detailed explication of the 'nature' of this particular INSET, this researcher supports Crew and Bodycott's (2001) call for further, longitudinal research into the phenomenon. Drawing on findings from this study, specific research questions are suggested to investigate the effects of immersion INSET. Within the constraints of case study method, implications are drawn for the design and delivery of future short-term, immersion INSET. A detailed mapping of what stakeholders reported as culture learning and cross-cultural experiences provided an account of this aspect of the phenomenon. There was strong evidence that a component based on intercultural communication should be included in any future trial to inform INSET design. A new model, entitled 'Intercultural INSET', is proposed for future implementation and research. It incorporates domains of learning established from the case study data and is informed by a theoretical construct designed in the current study and termed, 'Positive Effect Chain'. The proposed model embeds the design within contexts significant to the teacher/participants and to their ongoing critical reflection. This ongoing reflection informs thinking about the proposed INSET course evaluation. Finally, the proposed model extends INSET into a post-immersion phase. This subsequent phase extends participants' INSET interaction, once they have returned to their own countries and to their work in home classrooms. The model seeks enduring and effective learning and requires trial and further study. The case study approach provided a successful vehicle for organising the data of the research and for framing the discussion. It also yielded indications as to the means by which INSET providers might structure ongoing feedback and assessment of their intended curriculum design. These indications are reflected in the proposed 'Intercultural INSET' design.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language immersion</field><field name="subject">Chinese TESOL students</field><field name="subject">Mandarin first language</field><field name="subject">Cantonese first language</field><field name="subject">intercultural INSET</field><field name="subject">in-service education training</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060322.144245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relevance of Accounting Information for Valuation and Risk</field><field name="creator">Brimble, Mark Andrew</field><field name="description">A key theme in capital markets research examines the relationships between accounting information and firm value. Two concerns relating to the value relevance of accounting information are: (1) concerns over the explanatory and predictive power of the evidence presented in the prior literature (Lev, 1989); and (2) the evidence of a deterioration in the association between accounting information and stock prices over the past four decades (Collins, Maydew and Weiss, 1997; Francis and Schipper, 1999; Lev and Zarowin, 1999). These concerns provide the key motivation for this thesis which examines: (1) the usefulness of the clean surplus accounting equation in valuation; (2) the role of accounting information in estimating and predicting systematic risk and; (3) the changing nature of the relationship between accounting information, stock prices and risk over time. The empirical research provides evidence of the value-irrelevance of the clean surplus equation and that controlling for the functional form of the earnings-returns relationship is more important. Evidence is also provided that accounting variables are highly associated with M-GARCH risk betas and also possess predictive ability relative to these risk measures. Finally, the relationships between stock prices, risk models and accounting information are shown to have not deteriorated over time, contrary to prior evidence. Rather, the functional form of the relationship has changed from linear to a non-linear arctan association. Overall, accounting information continues to play the central role in the determination of stock prices and risk metrics.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corporations</field><field name="subject">corporation</field><field name="subject">firms</field><field name="subject">firm</field><field name="subject">value</field><field name="subject">valuation</field><field name="subject">accounting</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">stock price prediction</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030829.120234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of DNA Evidence on the Criminal Justice Process</field><field name="creator">Briody, Michael</field><field name="description">This research examines the effects of forensic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence on decisions in the courts and on the conduct of criminal investigations.  To assess effects on court decisions, quantitative analyses were conducted using primary data from the State of Queensland.  A control-comparison method was used to assess the effects in court, and this was made within a context of other evidentiary and extra-legal factors that had a bearing on case outcomes.  These other factors included defendant confessions, independent witness testimony and fingerprint and photographic evidence.  A sample of 750 cases referred by police for prosecution and finalised past the appeal stage in court, was selected for examination.  Half of these cases utilised DNA evidence, while the other half, as a control group, did not.  Cases were selected in four categories: sexual offences, serious assaults, homicides and property crime.  Data on the cases were analysed using advanced statistical methods and predictor models were developed to demonstrate how, given case configurations, the addition of DNA evidence could potentially alter court outcomes. Results for the three serious offence types were that DNA evidence emerged as a positive predictor that prosecutors would pursue cases in court, and it demonstrated a powerful influence on jury decisions to convict.  Incriminating DNA evidence demonstrated no significant effect on inducing guilty pleas from defendants for serious crimes against the person.  However, it did correlate significantly to cases reaching court and to guilty pleas being entered for property offence cases. The analysis of the effects on investigations relies on data from jurisdictions other than Queensland.  Secondary data and the literature were used to assess the potential for strategically using forensic intelligence, along with dedicated investigative resources, to reduce property crimes like burglaries and car thefts.  In the one study available that employed adequate research methods, three patrol areas in New South Wales, where a police operation was trialled, were compared to other areas that acted as a control.  The police operation aimed at 100% attendance at property crime scenes, the use of intelligence from DNA and fingerprint identifications and specialised investigative resources to reduce crime levels.  While the operation failed to achieve its goal, it did provide some valuable lessons. The effectiveness of the national criminal DNA database in the UK, reputed to lead the world, was then evaluated in relation to domestic burglaries.  Its Australian CrimTrac counterpart did not commence operations until March 2003, and by 2004 was not operating at maximum capacity.  Because no published studies were located that measured any effects of the UK database on crime levels, the criterion selected to measure performance was the proportion of convictions achieved through the database to reported crime.  For domestic burglaries, this ratio was calculated from secondary official data to be close to one percent (0.01), a figure that included the additional convictions achieved through the intelligence that the database provided. The research also examined forensic DNA in relation to issues of privacy and civil liberties.  Privacy issues are discussed beginning with an historical background to the use and misuse of genetic data.  This includes the searches for a 'criminal gene' and for genetic links to criminal behaviour.  DNA databases are contrasted with databanks, and it is questioned, since we leave our DNA wherever we go, whether it really is private.  Civil liberties issues that are discussed include whether providing DNA is a form of self-incrimination; how DNA has helped exonerate the convicted innocent; wrongful convictions based on flawed DNA evidence; whether occasional 'mass screenings' with DNA are a reversal of the onus of proof; concerns with DNA databases and 'function creep', and the planting or 'forgery' of DNA evidence including the use of amplicon contamination. In the final chapter, a balance is sought between on one hand, the goal of police and government to provide a safe society, and on the other, the rights to privacy and civil liberties expected by individuals in Western liberal democracies.  The chapter addresses the issues of concern raised in the earlier chapter about privacy and civil liberties, and makes recommendations on how these may be resolved.  The general approach favoured is to increase police powers in specific situations, but to couple these with the protection of individual rights through greater regulation of those powers.  The research also developed a case prioritising system aimed at helping clear laboratory backlogs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic science</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">criminal investigations</field><field name="subject">police</field><field name="subject">criminal databases</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050818.155533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Age and Aerobic Training on T Helper Lymphocyte Proliferation</field><field name="creator">Broadbent, Suzanne</field><field name="description">Deficiencies in immune responses can lead to increases in the rate of infections and chronic diseases, such as cancer. Critical to the adaptive immune response is the activation of the T helper (Th)/CD4+ cell, the subsequent production of interleukin 2 (IL-2), expression of IL-2 and transferrin receptors (IL-2R, TfR) and transcription of genes resulting in DNA synthesis and T cell clonal expansion. The CD4+ lymphocyte response is impaired with ageing. Recent evidence suggests that moderate, regular aerobic training may increase the responsiveness of CD4+ lymphocytes to antigenic and mitogenic challenge, and thereby improve immune function in the older individual. Large volumes of chronic endurance training, and also high intensity training, may adversely affect the immune response, leading to immunosuppression and increased risk of infections. Impaired immune function and increased rates of URTI are found in athletes who undergo large volumes of training, often at high intensity. Purpose: To investigate if long-term aerobic training improved the immune response in men and women aged 65 to 75 years and, and to investigate if long-term  endurance training depressed the immune response in male athletes aged 23 to 36 years. Methods:T helper lymphocyte proliferation was assessed monthly, by inducing the expression of CD25 (IL-2R ) and CD71 (transferrin) receptors with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Percentage of CD4+ cells positive for the receptors, and the receptor density, were measured using two colour flow cytometry. Concentrations of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and iron (Fe3+) were also measured monthly to determine the effect of endurance training on intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and Fe3+ ([Fe3+]i) within the CD4+ lymphocyte signal transduction pathway. Results: After twelve months of moderate aerobic training the percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes positive for CD25 increased in males aged 65 to 75 years, but not in females. There was no training effect on the density of CD25 in either gender, nor was there a training-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, total intracellular [Ca2+] from endoplasmic reticulum stores ([Ca2+]t) or [Fe3+] in this age group. Significant month to month variations in leucocyte, erythrocyte and haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, platelets, CD25 expression, CD71 expression, [Ca2+] and [Fe3+] were documented for both trained and untrained male and female groups. Aerobic capacity increased significantly with training for both men and women, with increases in  peak, peak power and peak ventilation (p less than 0.05). Twelve months of chronic endurance training produced significantly lower haemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin and platelet concentration for six ([Hb]) and nine months ([MCHC], platelets) of the year in Ironman-distance triathletes, compared to sedentary males aged 23  to 36 years. There was no evidence of immunosuppression in the trained group, with no significant differences between groups in the percentage of CD4+ cells positive for CD25. The trained group showed a significantly higher density of CD25 receptors in October, January and June, suggesting a better immune response during these months. Endurance training did not effect [Ca2+] or [Fe3+]. The trained group did not show a reduced leucocyte concentration, and reported significantly fewer cases of URTI in twelve months than their sedentary counterparts. The 23 to 36 years age group showed seasonal changes in haematological and immunological indices similar to older individuals, indicating that autumn, late winter and late spring are periods of reduced immuno-competency. Conclusion: Twelve months of moderate intensity training significantly increased functional capacity in older men and women, and the percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes expressing CD25 in older men, thereby improving the lymphoid immune response. Twelve months of endurance training significantly increased CD25 density in CD4+ lymphocytes in Ironman triathletes compared to sedentary young males. The monthly changes in immune variables in young and older subjects suggested that autumn, late winter and late spring might be periods where individuals were more at risk of succumbing to infections due to decreased lymphocyte responsiveness. Summer months appeared to be a period of increased lymphocyte responsiveness and proliferation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunodeficiency disease</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">immune</field><field name="subject">immune response</field><field name="subject">T-helper</field><field name="subject">lymphocyte</field><field name="subject">lymphocytes</field><field name="subject">aerobic training</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050113.115912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career and Family: The Role of Social Support</field><field name="creator">Broers, Catharina Maria</field><field name="description">Balancing a successful career with a family life can be challenging and impact on a person's satisfaction in their work and family roles, affecting not only the person but their partner and children as well. This study examined the influence of social support from family and work associates on the role satisfaction of female and male managers, and their children's adjustment. Participants were 96 male and 100 female managers and their families. The first aim of this study was to examine the relative importance of work and family support for satisfaction in the roles of paid worker, spouse and parent. Findings showed that social support had a domain-specific effect, with work support associated with job satisfaction, and family support associated with marital and parenting satisfaction. The second aim of the study was to evaluate gender differences in perceived social support, and the association of support with role satisfaction. Although there were considerable differences in the managers' work and family arrangements, female managers and male managers reported receiving similar levels of work and family support, and the strength of the relationship between social support and role satisfaction was similar for both genders. The final aim of the study was to examine the role of social support in the larger family system, as research has mainly focussed on the influence of social support on the support recipient. This study extended research on the relationship between social support and role satisfaction, by showing that family support was not only associated to managers' role satisfaction, but also to managers' interactions with their children, and their children's adjustment. Work support on the other hand, was related to job satisfaction, but not to parent-child interactions and child adjustment. The findings from this study could inform clinicians' treatment of families with children experiencing problems by addressing the relationship of family support with child adjustment. Findings could also inform governments' work and family agendas, which generally focus on providing assistance to employers with the development of workplace policies to improve work-family balance. Governments should also promote the role of family support, and provide information for families on how to arrange household and childcare tasks and provide support to each other to facilitate work-family balance. Furthermore, the current study showed that work support is positively related to employee's job satisfaction, which is important for employees as well as employers. Employers can promote supportive relationships among employees through establishing networking opportunities for their employees, such as breakfast meetings, workshops and seminars, and business planning days. This study showed that some people can have it all - a satisfying and successful career, a happy marriage, and fulfilling parenthood - and social support appears to play a significant role in achieving this.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Career and family</field><field name="subject">family roles</field><field name="subject">career roles</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="subject">family arrangements</field><field name="subject">parent-child interactions</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070110.095525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stakeholders' Meanings of Effective School Leadership: A Case Study in a New Zealand Primary School</field><field name="creator">Brooker, Barry N</field><field name="description">Guided by the theoretical underpinnings of symbolic interactionism, this study set out to describe and analyse how stakeholders in a New Zealand Primary School understand effective school leadership, and how their meanings of leadership are influenced by the context in which they work. Review of the school leadership literature indicated that there was widespread agreement on the importance of leadership for school effectiveness but limited empirical data on how, or why, this was the case. To gain an understanding of stakeholders' meanings of effective leadership the study adopted a qualitative, case study design. Purposive, criterion-based selection was used to select a school considered to have highly effective leadership practices and to identify a cross-section of stakeholders within that school. The participants were the principal, Board of Trustees chairperson, assistant principal, teacher, general staff member, and student. Data were gathered from concept maps, semi-structured interviews and selected school documents such as the school's Education Review Office report and staff job descriptions. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods of analysis, specifically the use of constant comparison through open and axial coding. The findings of the study are presented and examined in terms of three theoretical propositions that encapsulate the stakeholders' meanings of effective school leadership. The first proposition examines three core values - concern for the individual, a commitment to learning, and an expectation of high performance - that permeated the school and influenced stakeholders' meanings and leadership practices. The second proposition examines the provision of direction, which involved articulation of a strong vision, use of symbols and ceremonies, modelling valued practices and beliefs, and raising the aspirations of staff and students. The third proposition examines leading and managing processes, which included the development of a team structure, leading and managing staff appointments and non-performance, managing communications, meetings and time, and providing opportunities for decision-making and leadership. Although considered in separate chapters, the three theoretical propositions are inter-related. The findings from this study highlight the importance of a set of core, common values for school leadership, confirm the role that leaders play in providing direction through a variety of symbolic activities, re-emphasise the need for studies of leadership to consider the context specific and people-based aspects of leadership, and confirm the place of teams in achieving a school's goals and reinforcing its values. The findings of the study also identify a need for team learning and development, and for a greater focus on values and beliefs in development programmes for principals. In addition, from both a theoretical and practical perspective, the findings establish a need for further research into the conception and practice of distributed leadership, and indicate that principals continue to play a central leadership role in self-managing, primary schools. The study's findings, thus, add to an at present limited base of empirical data on school leadership, and provide an insight into the perspectives of those involved in the leadership processes. Although the study's findings are based on a single school, in a particular context, the research design and methodology, including use of theoretical propositions, means the findings and conclusions generated from the study are pertinent to leadership theory, leadership research and leadership policy and practice in various contexts. The findings of this study are therefore likely to be of use to researchers of educational leadership, school principals, other school leaders, educational policy makers, and those designing and implementing professional learning programmes for principals and other school leaders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School leadership</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Primary School</field><field name="subject">Education Review Office</field><field name="subject">School Board of Trustees</field><field name="subject">provision of direction</field><field name="subject">concern for the individual</field><field name="subject">leading and managing processes</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061023.151530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of the Constructs of Ageing on Gerontic Nursing Practice and Education: Reviewing the Past and Suggesting the Future</field><field name="creator">Brooker, Jennifer Anne</field><field name="description">This narrative inquiry traces and recounts an epiphaffic experience of a registered nurse on entering gerontic nursing, and her subsequent three-decade journey through the complexities and mazes of this nurse specialty. Such inquiry seeks to enable a better understanding of the realities of ageing and caring for older adults by opening up thinking and beliefs underpinning gerontic nursing work. Modern aged healthcare involves complex gerontic nursing actions, requiring highly skilled nursing personnel, but on the whole, gerontic nursing is dimly perceived and misunderstood by professional colleagues and the general public. Much of this misunderstanding is a legacy of an outdated ideology of gerontic nursing; yet these public beliefs, attitudes and interpretations are extremely powerful in determining aged care policy. As the population ages and more elderly people access healthcare services, society will be faced with an array of complex political and socioeconomic factors. This thesis aims to untangle such choices by pursuing the questions of: How have the constructs of ageing impacted on gerontic nursing practice and education?, What type of gerontic nurse will be required to provide future elderly care? and How will these people be educationally prepared for their new roles? Many of the constructs explored are dialectical in nature; that is, they have developed by inner conflict, the scheme of which is thesis and antithesis, or an original tendency and its opposing tendency. Such dialectical thinking has underpinned much of this thesis and in many instances, particularly in chapter 7, has taken the next step to the unification of these opposing tendencies; that is, synthesis, to create new understanding or meaning. Issues explored relate to: the ontology of ageing; the meaning of life; gerontophobia; Australia's changing population profile; changing aged healthcare systems; gerontic nursing cultural dilemmas; workforce planning; elder health in the future and gerontic nursing practice and education shifts. In a theoretical and methodological context, increasing difficulty with conventional epistemologies and the science founded on them is leading nurse theorists ever nearer to a postmodernist position. Narrative becomes a means through which gerontic nursing can accumulate and express cultural knowledge and critique procedure. The thesis exemplifies narrative's profound potential for underpinning the reconceptualisation of gerontic nursing practice and education. It is narrative's capacity to foreground the relationship between daily practice and knowledge that makes it a critical tool for the future of gerontic nursing inquiry. Narrative facilitates the paradigm, or more ontological shift from the dominant medical model of aged healthcare and 'tender loving care' rhetoric, to a therapeutic, caring-healing approach which has been in the margins in gerontic nursing practice. In the context of gerontic nurse education, narrative pedagogy offers new ways of thinking even in the midst of oppressive practices. Many issues remain unresolved about how gerontic nurses can be educated for future gerontic nursing practice. It would seem that aged care in Australia is a site of such organisational and cultural change, it threatens to undermine knowledge, care and understanding and shift care to untrained staff. The thesis illustrates how such approaches cloak much of gerontic nursing practice and devalue the intimate work of caring intelligently, emotionally and physically for frail older adults. However, while such tensions abound in gerontic nursing practice, the 2l~ century offers skilled gerontic nurses the opportunity to become key components in the refigured and redesigned aged healthcare delivery system. Research indicates that because few know enough about the sum of the future to impede well-constructed attempts at engaging in any new model design, taking any action is infinitely better than none. It is on this premise that Chapter seven posits a new model design for residential long-term aged care for older adults, believing that by imagining a different future, it can then be created and become a reality.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gerontic nursing</field><field name="subject">aged healthcare</field><field name="subject">registered nurses</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050906.140153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Frozen Continent: The Fall and Rise of Territory in Australian Constitutional Thought 1815-2003</field><field name="creator">Brown, A. J. (Alexander Jonathan)</field><field name="description">Through the late 20th century, global society experienced waves of unprecedented political and institutional change, but Australia came to be identified as "constitutionally speaking... the frozen continent", unable or unprepared to comprehensively modernise its own fundamental laws (Sawer 1967).  This thesis opens up a subject basic to, but largely unexplored in debate about constitutional change: the territorial foundations of Australian constitutional thought. Our conventional conclusions about territory are first, that Australia's federal system has settled around a 'natural' and presumably final territorial structure; and second, that this is because any federal system such as possessed by Australia since 1901 is more decentralised and therefore more suitable than any 'unitary' one.  With federalism coming back into vogue internationally, we have no reason to believe our present structure is not already the best. Reviewing the concepts of territory underpinning colonial and federal political thought from 1815 to the present day, this thesis presents a new territorial story revealing both these conclusions to be flawed.  For most of its history, Australian political experience has been based around a richer, more complex and still evolving range of territorial ideas.  Federalism is fundamental to our political values, but Australians have known more types of federalism, emerging differently in time and place, than we customarily admit.  Unitary values have supplied important symbols of centralisation, but for most of our history have also sought to supply far less centralised models of political institutions than those of our current federal experience.  Since the 1930s, in addition to underutilising both federal and unitary lines of imported constitutional theory, Australian politics has underestimated the extent to which our institutional treatment of territory has itself become unique. Despite its recent fall from constitutional discourse, territory is also again on the rise.  While political debate has been poorly placed to see it, Australia has experienced a recent resurgence in ideas about territorial reform, offering the promise of a better understanding of the full complexity of our constitutional theory and a new 'unfreezing' of the assumption that territorially, Australia will never change.  This thesis seeks to inform these vital new debates.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian history</field><field name="subject">territory</field><field name="subject">territorial</field><field name="subject">federation</field><field name="subject">federal government</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">political</field><field name="subject">constitutional</field><field name="subject">Constitution</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041105.092443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote Intelligent Air Traffic Control Systems for Non-Controlled Airports</field><field name="creator">Brown, Glenn</field><field name="description">Non-controlled airports are literally that - uncontrolled. Safe separation is achieved by pilot vigilance. The consensus of reports on incidences at noncontrolled airports generally conclude that pilots cannot rely entirely on vision to avoid collision and attempts should be made to obtain all available traffic information to enable a directed traffic search. Ideally, a system is required which has the ability to provide advice to all parties to ensure separation minima is maintained. Provision of a such a system would remove a measure of pressure from the pilot to allow that person to devote their attention to their prime responsibility of flying the aircraft. To this end, research on use of intelligent remote advisory systems for non-controlled airports was undertaken with emphasis on those systems which could minimize human resources and associated recurring costs, to provide a measure of repeatability and to provide an acceptable level of safety. A rule based system was developed and evaluated. The evaluation showed that use of a rule based system as the basis of an intelligent remote air traffic control system for non-controlled airports is a viable proposition. In test scenarios, collision hazards were identified and evasion tactics generated. For a full operational system, the application of the rules and definition of the aircraft circuit area may need refining; however, the results are certainly encouraging.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ATC</field><field name="subject">air traffic control systems</field><field name="subject">collision avoidance</field><field name="subject">intelligent remote advisory systems</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040225.084516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient Removal and Plant Growth in a Subsurface Flow Constucted Wetland in Brisbane, Australia</field><field name="creator">Browning, Catharine</field><field name="description">One of the major water quality issues affecting waterways is eutrophication. Controlling the input of nutrients from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WTP&#146;s) is a significant step in reducing eutrophication. Tertiary wastewater treatment for water quality improvement in particular Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) is often expensive to construct with high maintenance costs. Constructed wetlands (CWs) offer an alternative wastewater treatment and have been used successfully worldwide to treat various types of wastewater. This study investigated the effectiveness of the Oxley Creek horizontal subsurface flow (SSF) CW for tertiary municipal wastewater treatment and the suitability of four native macrophyte species, Baumea articulata, Carex fascicularis, Philydrum lanuginosum and Schoenoplectus mucronatus. The investigation consisted of four main components: 1) Plants: monitoring plant establishment, growth, impact of cropping, gravel size, nutrient content and storage for the four macrophyte species trialed; 2) Water quality - effluent treatment: monitoring water quality and quantity entering and leaving the wetland to determine wastewater treatment; 3) Organic matter: accumulation of organic carbon within the wetland cells for the different gravel sizes (5mm and 20mm) and 4) Mass balance: combining nutrient storage by macrophytes with wastewater nutrient removal to determine proportion of nutrient removal by plant uptake. The Oxley horizontal SSF CW is situated at the Oxley Creek WTP in Brisbane (South- East), Queensland, Australia which has a sub-tropical climate. The experimental design involved four different substrate treatments: Cell A new 5mm gravel, Cells B and C old 20mm gravel and Cell D old 5mm gravel. Cells B, C and D had been operational since 1995 whereas Cell A had been in use since 2000. The wetland received secondary treated effluent direct from the Oxley Creek WTP at an average flow rate of 8L/min with a median hydraulic loading rate (HLR) of 0.12m/day and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 to 3 days. Each cell consisted of three gravel sections (Section 1 to 3) separated by 1m wide open water sections. Gravel Sections 2 and 3 were planted out with the four macrophyte species in October 2000, Section 1 remained unplanted. Plant health and leaf height was monitored to assess plant establishment and growth. Investigations into plant establishment and growth demonstrated that Carex was most suitable. Carex achieved the highest maximum leaf height and was not affected by pests and disease unlike Schoenoplectus and Philydrum. Above ground biomass was cropped in May and August 2001, with biomass of cropped material measured on both occasions. Plant health and re-growth following cropping of above ground biomass in May and August 2001 demonstrated that cropping retarded regrowth of Schoenoplectus and Philydrum. Carex and Baumea recovered quickest following cropping, with Carex achieving leaf height prior to cropping within 6 months. Proportion of biomass contained above and below ground was measured by collecting biomass samples three times over 9 months and dividing into plant components (roots, rhizomes, leaves, flowers and stems). Investigations into the proportion of above and below ground components indicated that &gt;80% of biomass is contained above ground. Therefore cropping above ground biomass would potentially remove a significant proportion of nutrient storage from the CW. The results indicated that the ideal time for cropping was in spring/summer when plants are flowering particularly for Philydrum, whose flowering stems comprised 40% of total plant biomass. Flowering stems of Philydrum could potentially have a commercial use as a cut flower. Nutrient content of the four species in each cell was measured for individual plant components when first planted and after three (summer) and six (autumn) months growth. This was combined with biomass data to quantify nutrient bioaccumulation (nitrogen and phosphorus) by the four species in each cell. In terms of ability to bioaccumulate nitrogen and phosphorus, measurements of nutrient content and storage indicated that all four species were suitable. Nutrient storage was highest for Baumea and Carex. However high nutrient content may make the macrophytes more susceptible to pest and disease attack as found in this study for Philydrum and Schoenoplectus. Nutrient storage was highest in Cell A (new 5mm gravel) as a result of higher biomass achieved in this cell. The cropping and nutrient storage experiments indicated that Carex was the most suitable species for use in SSF CWs. Carex achieved the highest nutrient storage and had the fastest regrowth following cropping. Organic carbon accumulation between gravel particles measured as the proportion of material lost at 500oC was determined for gravel samples collected from each section for all four cells at 10cm depth increments (0-10cm, 10-20cm and 20-30cm). Investigations into organic carbon accumulation within the gravel substrate showed that organic accumulation was higher in the planted sections particularly for cells that had previously been planted with Phragmites australis. Organic accumulation was highest in the top 20cm of the gravel, which can be attributed to litter fall and root material. The effect of gravel size on plant growth, biomass, root depth and organic accumulation was assessed throughout the study. Investigations indicated that gravel size did not appear to affect biomass, maximum root penetration, re-growth following cropping and organic accumulation. Water quality from the inlet and outlet of each cell was measured fortnightly over 12 months (May 2001 to May 2002). Water quantity (HLR) was measured weekly using tipping buckets located at the inlet and outlet of each cell. Water quality and quantity were combined to investigate the nutrient removal efficiency of the wetland. The Oxley wetland was highly effective in reduction of TSS (&lt;2mg/L) and COD (&lt;30mg/L). Principal TSS and COD removal mechanism was physical with the first gravel section acting as a filter removing the majority of particulate material. Average loading rates to the wetland were 7.1 kg/ha/d PO4-P, 14 kg/ha/d NH4-N and 5.4 kg/ha/d NOx-N. Average daily mass removal rates ranged from 7.3 kg/ha NH4-N in Cell D to 4.6 kg/ha in Cell C (i.e. 37%-22% removal efficiency respectively); 5.2 kg/ha NOx-N in Cell C to 1.3 kg/ha in Cell A (i.e. 75%-22% removal efficiency) and 0.8 kg/ha PO4-P in Cell A to 0.1 kg/ha in Cell C (i.e. 10%-1% removal efficiency). Removal efficiency was calculated on a loads basis. Insufficient retention times (2-3 days based on tracer study) and anaerobic conditions (&lt;1mg/L) limited further nitrogen removal. Negligible phosphorus removal for all cells was attributed to short retention time and likelihood of phosphorus adsorption being close to capacity. Investigation into the proportion of nutrient removal attributed to plant uptake demonstrated that nutrient uptake and storage in plant biomass accounted for &lt;12% TN and &lt;5% TP. This research project has provided several useful outcomes that can assist in future guidelines for designing effective SSF CWs in the subtropics/tropics. Outcomes include the importance of maintaining an adequate water level during the initial establishment phase. Maximising effluent treatment by pre-treatment of wastewater prior to entering SSF CWs to enable ammonia to be converted to nitrate and ensuring adequate hydraulic retention time. Carex fascicularis was the most suitable species particularly where harvesting regimes are employed. Philydrum flowering stems could be used as a cut flower in the florist trade.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">constructed wetlands</field><field name="subject">plant growth</field><field name="subject">biological nutrient removal</field><field name="subject">BNR</field><field name="subject">eutrophication</field><field name="subject">subsurface flow</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040226.092311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of location and other attributes on the price of products which are place-sensitive in demand</field><field name="creator">Bull, Adrian Osborn</field><field name="description">There is a particular class of products where people must visit the point of production in order to be consumers, and these products are normally lifestyle, tourism or leisure services. Examples include environmentally-based leisure facilities, housing, and tourist accommodation. Frequently the assertion is made that location makes one product 'superior' to another, in terms of both its production and consumption. This study enquires into the asserted significance of location in product differentiation, with special reference to hospitality and tourism products. The study is particularly concerned with commercially tradeable products offered to a consumer market by a number of competitive firms, rather than being concerned with one-off markets for assets for exclusive use, such as houses. By the use of characteristics theory, this study shows that the role of geographic location within a product such as hotel accommodation is that of a product-differentiating characteristic, or set of characteristics. However, the location of such a product is an example of a fixed, or unalterable, characteristic, once a supplier has entered a market. With most product-differentiating characteristics, a supplier can attain an optimal  business position by enhancing the differentiation for as long as customers' willingness to pay 'the extra' (marginal revenue) exceeds or equals the cost (marginal cost) of product enhancement. However, a supplier cannot easily do this for a fixed characteristic. So what is the value of a particular location to a supplier of this type of product? This study develops a model to identify the specific elements of a location that are important to consumers, and then to estimate their values. It is argued that the values of each specific element (locational characteristics) should contribute in a predictable way to the overall price of each product in the market place. It is also shown in this study that individual suppliers who cannot identify, or who incorrectly set, prices based on locational characteristics face a measurable variation in demand from the mean in the market place. The model and methodology are tested empirically in the market for international-standard hotel accommodation on the Gold Coast, Queensland. It is shown that this constitutes a single, coherent market as a tourist destination, where a limited number of producers compete with differentiated products. Those product characteristics that are important to the market are identified, and it is shown that elements of location and other characteristics can be valued accurately across the market. The relationship between suppliers' 'overpricing' or 'underpricing' of their product characteristics and variations in demand from the market average is explored. This study therefore has implications for pricing strategy, as well as for land valuation and planning. The study can be seen as contributing primarily to the economics literature, in the area of industrial economics, but also to the marketing, and hospitality and tourism literature.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">industrial economics</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">pricing</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">hotel industry</field><field name="subject">location</field><field name="subject">hedonic pricing</field><field name="subject">product attributes</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030102.085840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Relational Complexity Approach to the Development of Hot/Cool Executive Functions</field><field name="creator">Bunch, Katie</field><field name="description">Previous research indicates that many important changes in executive functions, or higher cognitive capacities, occur between the ages of three and five years. Additionally, a distinction can be made between the cognitive functions associated with two different cortical regions. The functions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC) are assessed using 'cool' tasks that are abstract and decontextualised. In contrast, the functions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are assessed using 'hot' tasks that require flexible appraisal of the affective significance of stimuli (Zelazo &amp; M&#252;ller, 2002). Different clinical populations have been hypothesized to differ in terms of their impairment on tasks associated with each area of functioning. Current research conclusions regarding the primacy of hot versus cool executive function impairments are limited, however, as they have not taken complexity into account. That is, tasks currently used in investigations of hot and cool executive functions might differ in terms of the complexity of the cognitive processes that the tasks require. Therefore, comparisons across tasks may be misleading because these tasks vary in terms of the demands they place on participants as well as their hot versus cool status. While complexity theories have been applied to a number of cool tasks, only one hot task, those measuring theory-of-mind abilities, have been analysed in terms of complexity. One aim of the current research was to modify several tasks presumed to measure OFC performance to include a complexity manipulation. Tasks from three hot domains (conditional discrimination, the Children's Gambling Task, and future-oriented decision-making) were analysed in terms of their relational complexity, that is, the number of related entities or arguments inherent in a task or concept (Halford, 1993). Based on these complexity analyses, binary-relational and ternary-relational items of each of these tasks were developed or existing tasks were selected and/or modified. The binary-relational items were closely matched to the ternary-relational items in terms of stimuli and procedure, however, they were lower in complexity. After pilot testing, the three new measures of hot executive functioning were included in a larger test battery that was administered to a sample of 120 normally developing 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-year-old children. Existing binary- and ternary-relational items assessing theory-of-mind (a hot task) and three cool measures (transitivity, class inclusion and the Dimensional Change Card Sort test) were also included. The inclusion of measures of both hot and cool executive functions, each with complexity manipulated, allowed for the examination of a possible differential age of emergence of executive abilities associated with the DL-PFC versus the OFC. In support of the relational complexity approach, significant complexity effects were found across all seven tasks. Items at a higher level of complexity were experienced as relatively more difficult by children of all ages. Significant effects of age were also observed, with performance across all tasks increasing with age. The age effects were strongest on the ternary-relational items. The pass-fail data indicated that the majority of children in all age groups succeeded on the binary-relational items. However, it was not until a median of five years of age that children were able to process ternary relations. Consequently, the ternary-relational items produce the greatest differences in performance between the four age groups. The overall pattern of the results also suggested that a distinction can be made between the ages of emergence of abilities associated with the OFC versus the DL-PFC. The results of the pass-fail percentages, patterns of age-related change and age effects on domain factor scores all suggested that while hot executive functions may begin to develop around four years of age, similar levels of improvement are not seen in cool executive functions until five years of age. Thus, the ability to succeed on ternary-relational items of hot executive function tasks appeared to emerge slightly earlier than the cool executive function tasks. Complexity appears to be a critical factor underlying children's performance on executive function tasks, and future assessment regarding the development of executive abilities will benefit from keeping this in mind. While some refinement of new task items may be beneficial, the current test battery may have utility in further examinations of the executive profiles underlying clinical groups, such as children with autism and ADHD.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Executive functions</field><field name="subject">dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</field><field name="subject">orbitofrontal cortex</field><field name="subject">binary-relational items</field><field name="subject">ternary-relational items</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070713.121052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living Life to the Full: a Qualitative Study of Community Theatre, Older People and the Construction of Leisure</field><field name="creator">Burden, Josephine E</field><field name="description">Older women and men were participants in this qualitative research of three case studies of community theatre. Their stories, gathered through in-depth interviews and participant observation of the theatre projects over a four year period, informed the development of a theoretical model of leisure as process. Through devising and presenting their theatre pieces, 50 older people, ranging in age from 45-8 5 years, with differing cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, reflected on personal experiences, negotiated their own processes for working collaboratively, and presented the stories of theft lives publicly in a way which affirmed their actions and understandings of themselves and theft world. Interviews with more than 30 of these people allowed an analysis of the ways in which older people negotiated the processes of play-building and constructed meaning in their lives at a time when the social structures of paid work and family were becoming less central as people moved into their third age. This research has located the study of individual agency through leisure in the context of the social structures which shape constraints to leisure and in turn limit individual agency. As such, the research has been concerned both with the self and with social relationship and has theorised leisure as a process of negotiation. Since process implies change over time, the research methods used and the leisure context selected for study were also process oriented. The research methodology was emergent and took on qualities of action research as the study progressed. By focusing on community theatre as the social context for leisure, the nexus between community development, community theatre and action research was examined and found to inform a broader understanding of leisure as process. The research has also expanded knowledge of community theatre as a collaborative process which draws on individual and collective reflections to build public presentations of issues of concern to participants. The processes of community theatre have received no attention to date in the leisure literature. The negotiation of self takes place in different social contexts for women and for men, for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, for old and young, and for people from different socio-economic backgrounds. This research demonstrated that changes in personal situations as a result of the aging process, changes in family context and changes in work context are associated with changes in the negotiation of self, and these changes are expressed through leisure activity as well as other involvements less clearly classified as leisure. Purposive aspects of leisure assumed greater significance as people grew older and this was expressed in the culture of busyness and a pride in 'never being home'. Older women, in particular, developed friendships and community networks outside the family unit as relationships with husbands and children changed. These social connections were found to facilitate difficult transitions such as divorce or the death of a spouse. Community theatre supported the development of community networks, and presented an opportunity to claim a voice in the public arena and challenge the invisibility of older age. The research added to knowledge about constraints on leisure involvement by older people, and identified personal, social and material constraints. The most significant of these were the personal constraints of fear and of ill-health. However, participants in this research continued to negotiate a path through constraint in order to live their lives to the full. Analysis of their stories indicated that whilst constraint sometimes operated as a hierarchical process of control pushing people into isolation, people who were supported in their efforts to negotiate constraint through the development of community networks gained self-confidence and a heightened sense of agency. The processes of community development used in community theatre were found to facilitate the negotiation of constraint by developing personal skills and strengthening social support. The constructivist orientation of the research acknowledged the dialectical nature of knowledge construction and the possibility of social change through research. Aspects of action research were demonstrated in the processes of community theatre, which also seeks social as well as personal change. The research has a political motivation in that it seeks to strengthen the position of participants. Concern with the power relationship between researcher and researched facilitated a deeper understanding of the role of power in the process of leisure. The research opens up one small window on the processes whereby people may continue to live life to the full through active engagement in life and leisure.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community theatre</field><field name="subject">leisure involvement</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">personal situations</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050914.125729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toxicology Investigations With The Pectenotoxin-2 Seco Acids</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Vanessa Anne</field><field name="description">Pectenotoxins (PTXs) are a group of large cyclic polyether compounds associated with diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) as they are often found in combination with other DSPs such as okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysis toxins (DTXs) in shellfish. Although classified and regulated with the DSPs, there is debate over whether these toxins should be classified with DSP toxins. To date, ten different analogues of PTXs have been identified from shellfish and algae, and of these, the pectenotoxin-2 seco acids (PTX2-SAs) are of particular interest as they have previously been implicated in a shellfish poisoning incident in Australia, but relatively little was known of their toxicology. One such incident occurred in December 1997, when approximately 200 people were reported with severe diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning in Northern New South Wales (NSW). Analysis of the shellfish associated with this incident revealed relatively high PTX2-SA concentrations (approx. 300 micrograms/kg shellfish meat), with only trace amounts of pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2) and OA. Following this incident, PTX2-SAs were considered a health threat and guidelines were implemented in the absence of toxicological data, which has caused a great economic burden to shellfish industries around the globe, in particular to Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. Such regulation created in the absence of scientific data demonstrated the need to determine the toxicology of PTX2-SAs in commercial shellfish. Thus a comprehensive study on the toxicology and possible health implications of the PTX2-SAs in Australian shellfish was conducted. PTX2-SAs were isolated in different batches from shellfish (pipis, oysters and mussels) and from algal bloom samples of Dinophysis caudata. Toxin extraction was conducted with several purification stages and chemical analysis was performed with high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS). The chemical stability of the PTX2-SAs was investigated to ensure consistency of doses between toxicology experiments. Acute dosing studies with mice were then performed and included toxicopathology investigations with light microscopy and electron microscopy, in addition to toxin distribution studies and investigation of in vivo lipid peroxidation. In vitro studies with HepG2 cells included cytotoxicity assays, cell cycle investigations using flow cytometry and gene expression profiling of cells exposed to PTX2-SAs employing cDNA microarray technology. Acute pathology studies demonstrated that the PTX2-SAs do not cause the characteristic symptoms or lesions associated with DSP toxins. No diarrhoea was observed at any dose level in mice and no deaths occurred up to the maximum dosing level of 1.6mg/kg PTX2-SA. Only one batch of PTX2-SA extract produced toxic lesions characteristic of a DSP toxin (batch 1-pilot study) but after follow up studies, it was determined that this first batch of shellfish most likely contained an additional unidentified shellfish toxin or contaminant that co-extracted with PTX2-SAs during toxin isolation and purification procedures. This finding highlighted the importance of supporting the inclusion of the mice bioassay in procedures for shellfish toxin testing to enable detection of new toxins, and also highlighted the importance of toxin purification for toxicology studies. A significant rise in malondialdehyde excretion was observed within 24 hours of dosing mice, indicating that the PTX2-SAs may cause damage by lipid peroxidation in vivo. In vitro studies showed HepG2 cells to have cell cycle and gene expression changes within 24 hours of a dose of 800ng/mL PTX2-SAs. Cell cycle arrest was observed at the G2/M checkpoint and gene expression changes included alterations in genes involved in cell cycle control, lipid metabolism and transport, lipid genesis and trace metal transport. Many genes involved in DNA repair processes were moderated at the 24 hour point, but as no apoptosis was observed up to 72 hours post dosing it is a promising indication that any DNA damage that may have been caused by the administration of PTX2-SAs was not lethal, and was able to be repaired. In light of the information provided by toxicology investigations in this PhD, with particular reference to evidence of in vivo lipid peroxidation by raised levels of MDA in mouse urine, and changes in cell cycle distribution and gene expression in a cultured human cell line, it is concluded that there is potential for these toxins to induce biological changes in mammalian cells in vivo and in vitro, and hence potential for PTX2-SAs to cause health effects in humans. During the course of this three-year study, developments in techniques for shellfish toxin identification within our laboratories have revealed that the shellfish responsible for the 1997 NSW poisoning incident contained significant concentrations of okadaic acid acyl esters that were not detected at the time of the NSW incident. Although reportedly less toxic than okadaic acid itself, the OA ester concentrations present may have been sufficient to cause the observed symptoms. It is also theorized that these esters could be hydrolyzed in the human gastro-intestinal tract to release okadaic acid. In the light of this new evidence and with no pathology lesions or symptoms of diarrhoea being observed in PTX2-SA dosing studies with mice, we now believe these OA acyl esters to be the causative agent in the 1997 NSW DSP incident and not the PTX2-SAs. Nothing is currently known of the chronic toxicology of PTX2-SAs and thus their potential implications to public health in the long term cannot determined. The toxicology investigations in this thesis were acute studies, and it has not been established if the observed changes could be repaired or returned within normal limits without the manifestation of illness or disease occurring. Utilizing the acute toxicology information in this thesis, a health risk assessment for consumption of PTX2-SA contaminated shellfish was performed. This risk assessment, employing numerous safety factors essential for an incomplete data set, produced guideline values that are lower than the current recommend concentrations. To date, there has been no solid evidence that PTX2-SAs cause illness in humans &#150; all documented incidents involving the PTX2-SAs have also included other DSP contaminants that are known to cause human illness. Pathology has not unequivocally been demonstrated in animal studies and thus, in consideration of the epidemiological evidence, PTX2-SAs cannot be considered as high a risk to public health as was previously thought. For the reasons discussed above, and weighing up risk-benefit considerations of the economic burden the current guideline values are causing to shellfish industries around the globe, it is recommended that levels of PTX2-SAs be monitored in recognition of the precautionary principle, but no longer regulated as tightly with other DSPs until such a time that toxicological or epidemiological evidence can prove that the PTX2-SAs are a DSP and are a more considerable threat to human health than has been indicated by toxicology studies in this thesis. This study has produced a substantial amount of acute toxicology data and has provided a good basis for future chronic toxicology investigations with the PTX2-SAs for regulatory purposes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pectenotoxins</field><field name="subject">PTX</field><field name="subject">PTXs</field><field name="subject">diarrhetic shellfish poisoning</field><field name="subject">shellfish toxins</field><field name="subject">seco acids</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030905.090222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ABC Online: Becoming the ABC</field><field name="creator">Burns, Maureen</field><field name="description">This thesis combines histories of the implementation of ABC Online (the website of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Australia's largest national Public Service Broadcaster) with the political philosophies of Foucault, and of Deleuze and Guattari.  Following the Deleuzian argument that institutions of enclosure are in crisis because they exist in between diagrams of the disciplinary and control societies, the thesis tests each of the Foucauldian diagrams of discipline, governmentality and control against the ABC as Public Service Broadcaster. It explores issues such as which ABC strategies belong to which diagram, and the ways in which changes in communications technologies altered governing rationales of these diagrams at the ABC. The thesis uses the implementation of ABC Online to explore the idea of the ABC in the late 1990s as operating in between social diagrams.  One way of examining this 'in between-ness' is to use the Public Service Broadcasting idea as an instance of arboreal thinking and the internet idea as rhizomic. The thesis employs that model to argue that Public Service Broadcasting as it is practised is not merely an arboreal assemblage, and that actual implementations of the internet are more than merely rhizomic assemblages. The thesis details some of the earliest relations between broadcasting and the internet at the ABC, and describes the relations between rhizomic and arboreal images of the ABC at particular sites and in various discourses. This examination concludes that both ways of imagining the ABC - the arboreal and the rhizomic - have been essential to the success of ABC Online. While the position of the ABC in between social diagrams caused a sense of crisis, ABC Online was in fact successful largely because of its position in between social diagrams.  Not only was ABC Online remarkably successful in its first five years, but it was successful in ways which could not be accommodated in such documents as the ABC Charter. The public silences of ABC Online both allowed it to thrive, and conversely supported arboreal stratified ways of defending the ABC. Defences of the ABC that used arboreal thinking as a rhetorical strategy continued to dominate public discussion of the ABC, despite the successes of contrary examples in practice. One such example was the successful implementation of Radio Australia Online at a time when the Mansfield Review sought to limit the scope of the ABC to domestic free-to-air broadcasting. When some ABC Online practices were publicised in relation to the proposed Telstra deal, the resultant controversy concentrated on the non-commercial/commercial boundary at the ABC. The controversy also highlighted fears that the Online environment may alter the ethical relations between the ABC and its publics. In particular, the ethical goals of independence and integrity were perceived as being under threat in the World Wide Web environment. These goals were further problematised within the organisation by the demands of interactive subsites. These subsites demonstrated an altered ethical relation between the ABC and its user in the online environment of the control society.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ABC</field><field name="subject">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</field><field name="subject">public service broadcasting</field><field name="subject">public service broadcasters</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">website</field><field name="subject">websites</field><field name="subject">Michel Foucault</field><field name="subject">Gilles Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Felix Guattari</field><field name="subject">World Wide Web</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040520.111544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regaining Equilibrium: Understanding the Process of Sibling Adjustment to Pediatric Acquired Brain Injury</field><field name="creator">Bursnall, Samantha</field><field name="description">This study developed a comprehensive framework for understanding the process of sibling adjustment to pediatric acquired brain injury (ABI). Grounded theory methodology was employed to inductively explore the issues siblings perceived to be their main concerns and how they managed these concerns. Fifty-three interviews were conducted recursively with twenty child and adolescent siblings of individuals with an ABI, four adult siblings of individuals with an ABI and four child and adolescent siblings of individuals with congenital disability. Observational and secondary data from hospital staff and parents were also analyzed. The framework was developed and verified through simultaneous data collection and analysis (Glaser, 1978; Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990). The main issue of concern for siblings following their brother or sister's ABI was the loss of equilibrium in their lives. Losing equilibrium was defined by the concepts of vulnerability and emotional turmoil. Specifically, following ABI, siblings were confronted with the vulnerability of their assumptive world, which was influenced by their exposure to unforeseen circumstances, mortality, the enduring nature of their brother or sister&#146;s injury, and the perceived vulnerability of their family unit. In response to these losses, siblings experienced emotional turmoil, including acute anxiety, chronic worry, ambivalent emotions and disenfranchised grief. Losing equilibrium was an ongoing concern for siblings that threatened their sense of security, safety, predictability and control for many years post injury. To manage these ongoing concerns, siblings employed a variety of interrelated strategies to regain equilibrium. These strategies were conceptualized by the concepts, navigating and sacrificing. The purpose of these strategies was to restore safety, predictability and control in the siblings' environment. Navigating required siblings to negotiate the enduring disequilibrium in their lives, by challenging new rules with old tools, withdrawal, trying and buying, merging the familiar and the unfamiliar and integrating. Sacrificing required siblings to relinquish their needs and desires to regain equilibrium and was illustrated through the concepts, surrogate parent, surrendering parental attention, emotional repression, and self-blame. These self-sacrificing strategies appeared to influence siblings' long-term personal development. For instance, siblings believed that they became more responsible, understanding, tolerant, and cautious in everyday activities. The data indicated that these personal changes subsequently maintained siblings sacrificing behaviors. Although sacrificing strategies were employed by some siblings from the time of the ABI, most siblings mastered their loss of equilibrium through the navigating process. Like the non-finite nature of losing equilibrium, regaining equilibrium was an ongoing cyclical process. Rather than focusing on adjustment outcomes only, the current study has extended previous research by providing a framework for understanding the process of sibling adjustment to ABI. This framework provides a set of integrated categories, concepts, hypotheses and propositions to inform future research and practice.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">injury</field><field name="subject">damage</field><field name="subject">child</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">pediatric</field><field name="subject">acquired</field><field name="subject">adjustment</field><field name="subject">equilibrium</field><field name="subject">sibling</field><field name="subject">siblings</field><field name="subject">brother</field><field name="subject">brothers</field><field name="subject">sister</field><field name="subject">sisters</field><field name="subject">adolescent</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">adult</field><field name="subject">adults</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040514.114829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution and Partitioning of Trace Metals and Tributyltin in Estuarine Sediments</field><field name="creator">Burton, Edward D.</field><field name="description">An improved understanding of the geochemical partitioning of trace metals and tributyltin (TBT) in sediments is of great importance in risk assessment and remedial investigation. The aim of this thesis was to examine the distribution and partitioning behaviour of trace metals and TBT in benthic, estuarine sediments. This was achieved by a series of field- and laboratory-based studies investigating factors controlling the geochemical behaviour of trace metals and TBT in sediments from south-east Queensland, Australia. The distribution and enrichment of selected trace metals in benthic sediments of the Southport Broadwater (a semi-enclosed coastal body of water adjacent to the Gold Coast city, south-eastern Queensland, Australia) was studied. Sediment contamination for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sn and Zn was assessed by (1) comparison with Australian sediment quality guidelines, (2) calculation of the index of geoaccumulation based on regional background values, and (3) geochemical noi-malisation against Al (i.e. the abundance of alumino-silicate clay minerals). Based on this approach, several sites were found to be strongly enriched with Cu, Pb, Sn and Zn, arising from sources related to either urban runoff or vessel maintenance activities. The geochemical partitioning of Cu, Pb and Zn was examined in sediments collected from three of these sites of sediment contamination. Total Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations in coarse-textured (65 to 90 % sand sized particles), sub-oxic sediments (Eh + 120 to +260 mV) ranged from 8.3 to 194 mg/kg for Cu, 16.3 to 74.8 mg/kg for Pb and 30.1 to 220 mg/kg for Zn, and were related to vertical trends in sediment texture. The association of Cu, Pb and Zn with amorphous oxides, crystalline oxides and organic matter was linearly dependent on the abundance of each phase. For retention by amorphous oxide minerals, the trace metal retention ranged from 5.2 to 23.7 mgcjgFe oxide as Fe for Cu, 1 2.8 to 21 .5 mgpb/gFe oxide as Fe for Pb, and 23. I to 85.7 mgm/gFe oxide as Fe for Zn. Corresponding values for association with crystalline oxides were an order of magnitude less than those for amorphous oxides, indicating a weaker affinity of trace metals for crystalline oxides. The relationships describing association with organic matter ranged from 17.6 to 54.0 mgcu/gorg c for Cu, 6.1 to 9.6 mgpb/gorg c for Pb and 6.4 to 16.4 mgzn/gorg c for Zn. The in-situ solid/pore-water partitioning of TBT and the degradation products, dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MBT), was determined for an estuarine sediment profile with previously identified elevated Sn concentrations. Total butyltin levels were (depending on depth) 220 to 8750 jig/kg for TBT, 150 to 5450 jig/kg for DBT and 130 to 4250 jig/kg for MBT. Pore-water butyltin concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 2.35 jig/L for TBT, 0.07 to 3.25 jiglL for DBT, and 0.05 to 0.53 J.tgIL for MBT. The organic carbon normalised distribution ratios (Doc) were similar for TBT, DBT and MBT, and were io to 106 L/kg. Values for the Butyltin Degradation Index (BDI) were larger than I at depths greater than 10 cm below the sediment/water-column interface, indicating that substantial TBT degradation has occurred in the sediments. This suggests that natural attenuation may be a viable sediment remediation strategy. Factors controlling the partitioning behaviour of Cu, Pb and Zn in nonsulfidic, estuarine sediments were examined in controlled laboratory-based studies with the use of combined sorption curve - sequential extraction analysis. This allowed determination of sorption parameters for Cu, Pb and Zn partitioning to individual geochemical fractions. Partitioning behaviour in sulfidic sediments was also determined by sequentially extracting Cu, Pb and Zn from synthetic sulfide minerals, and from natural sediment and pure quartz sand after spiking with acid-volatile sulfide (AVS). Trace metal sorption to the 'carbonate' fraction (pH 5, NaOAc extraction) increased with metal loading due to saturation of sorption sites associated with the 'Fe-oxide' (NH2OH.HCI extraction) and 'organic' (H202 extraction) fractions in non-sulfidic sediments. Freundlich isotherm parameters describing sorption to the 'Fe-oxide' and 'organic' fractions were dependent on the sediment Fe-oxide and organic carbon content, respectively. Sequential extraction of Cu from pure CuS, AVS-spiked sediment and AVS-spiked quartz sand showed that AVS-bound Cu was quantitatively recovered in association with the 'organic' fraction. However, some AVS-bound Pb and Zn were recovered by the NH2OH.HCI step (which has been previously interpreted as 'Fe-oxide' bound metals) in the sequential extraction procedure used in this study. This indicates that the sequential extraction of Pb and Zn in sulfidic sediments may lead to AVS-bound metals being mistaken as Fe-oxide bound species. Caution should therefore be exercised when interpreting sequential extraction results for Pb and Zn in anoxic sediments. Tributyltin (TBT) sorption to four natural sediment samples in artificial seawater was also examined under a range of modified pH and salinity conditions in controlled laboratory-based studies. Three of the sediment samples were relatively pristine with regard to TBT contamination, but the fourth was a TBT-contaminated sediment from a commercial marina. Sorption of TBT was described well by linear sorption isotherms, with distribution coefficients ranging from 6.1 to 5210 L/kg depending on pH and salinity. Sediment organic C content and particle size distribution were important determinants of sorption behaviour. The presence of resident TBT in the contaminated marina sediment caused a substantial reduction in TBT sorption due to satuaration of high selectivity sites. Desorption of TBT from the marina sediment was described by relatively large observed distribution coefficients ranging from 5100 to 9400 L/kg, suggesting that aging effects may reduce sorption reversibility. Increased artificial seawater salinity generally reduced TBT sorption at pH 4 and pH 6, but enhanced TBT sorption at pH 8. Regardless of salinity, maximum sorption of TBT was observed at pH 6, which is attributed to an optimal balance between abundance of the cationic TBT species and deprotonated surface ligands. Consideration of aqueous TBT speciation along with octanol-water partitioning behaviour suggest that hydrophobic partitioning of TBTCI to non-polar organic matter was important for pH (up to) 6, whilst partitioning of TBTOH was important at higher pH. The effect of aging on the solid/pore-water partitioning and desorption behaviour of TBT in sediments was examined. Three sediment samples with contrasting physical and chemical properties were spiked with 10 mg/kg TBT and aged under sterile conditions for periods of time ranging from I to 84 days. Aging had a negligible effect in a sandy sample with very low organic carbon content (0.2 % w/w). In contrast, for samples with larger amounts of organic carbon (2.6 and 4.8 % w/w), the effect of aging on the solid/pore-water partitioning behaviour was significant. For these samples, the apparent distribution coefficients (Ks) obtained from sequential two hour desorption experiments exhibited a two-fold increase between spiked sediments subjected to aging for 1 day and 84 days. This study demonstrates that aging effects may be an important aspect of TBT fate in contaminated sediments. Overall, the results described in this thesis demonstrate that environmental factors (i.e. pH, salinity, Eh, aging) and sediment composition (i.e. abundance of fine alumino-silicate minerals, organic matter, Fe-oxides, reactive sulfides) exert substantial effects on trace metal and TBT partitioning. The current reliance on measurement of total trace metal and TBT concentrations in contaminated sediment management may consequently lead to inaccurate estimates of environmental risk and inappropriate remediation measures if other factors regulating contaminant distribution and partitioning are ignored.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trace metals</field><field name="subject">tributyltin</field><field name="subject">estuarine sediments</field><field name="subject">Southport Broadwater (Queensland)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050830.161359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Blonde Paradox: Power and Agency Through Feminine Masquerade and Carnival</field><field name="creator">Burton, Laini Michelle</field><field name="description">Blonde hair is a potent and highly visible sign in western culture. Although the popularity and desirability of blonde hair in the West is well documented, since the 1950s, blonde hair has also generated many negative associations and these have contributed to myths around blondeness. In particular, women who dye their hair blonde find themselves in a paradoxical position; they simultaneously evoke desire and derision. This thesis uses the model of feminine masquerade outlined by Joan Riviere (1929) as a locus for discussing the transgressive potential of the knowing use of blondeness as a sign. When women wear blondeness in this way they embrace it as an oblique means to access privilege. This self-reflexivity allows women to enter sites of power that they are otherwise excluded from. Drawing on ideas of the carnivalesque, as described by Mikhail Bakhtin (1968), this thesis also proposes that the carnivalesque is employed by women in order to transgress patriarchal boundaries through an ironic masquerade of the archetypal blonde. These paradoxical meanings of blondeness are evoked in the work of performance artist Vanessa Beecroft. Beecroft stages both the reflexive awareness of today's blonde woman and the way in which she is shaped by socio-cultural forces beyond her control. Through reference to Beecroft's art, this dissertation builds upon the optimism and transgressive potential of Bakhtin's 'carnival' and Riviere's 'feminine masquerade' to re-present the identity/position of blonde women as one of agency and power.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blonde hair</field><field name="subject">feminine masquerade</field><field name="subject">blondeness as a sign</field><field name="subject">Vanessa Beecroft</field><field name="subject">carnivalesque</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070122.110616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Relational Outcomes on Customer Loyalty</field><field name="creator">Butcher, Kenneth John</field><field name="description">Customer loyalty in services is the focus of the research. The research problem sought to determine both indirect and indirect effects of relational outcomes on customer loyalty, conceptualised as a psychological state. Relational outcomes are defined as: the thoughts, feelings, and relationships perceived by customers arising from the interaction with a service employee. This class of variable is differentiated from other relational factors such as the characteristics of the actors in the interaction and their behaviours. The effects of relational outcome antecedents were compared to service evaluation antecedents such as customer satisfaction, quality, and value. Customer loyalty was modelled as a psychological state and grounded in the unique characteristics of services. The pioneering work of Kingstrom (1983) was used as a basis for extending the literature. Customer loyalty is an important variable for both services marketing researchers and industry. Accordingly, the research was justified on both theoretical and managerial grounds. Four factors inspired the identification of the research gap: a lack of service loyalty research grounded in service characteristics, lack of studies that conceptualised loyalty as a psychological state, inadequacy of service evaluation measures to predict customer loyalty, and the perceived importance of social interaction to service outcomes. Data collection included pilot studies, re-analysis of published literature, and three major studies. In the first major study, 23 informants provided insights into the nature of three specific relational outcomes: friendship, social comfort, and social regard. The second study was a cross-sectional survey of 190 hair-dressing customers. The specific relationships between friendship, social regard, social comfort, value for money, service encounter satisfaction, perceived core service quality, and customer loyalty were established in this study. New scales were also developed for friendship, social regard, social comfort, and customer loyalty. A third study collected survey data from 406 customers of hairdressing salons, cafes, and naturopathic clinics. Hypothesised relationships were tested through three nested structural equation models. The results indicate that relational outcomes in general are important to customer loyalty. Their effects on loyalty as a psychological state are both direct and indirect. The strength of the effects of relational outcomes on loyalty compares favourably with the effects of service evaluation measures on loyalty. The construct of friendship between individual customer and service employee was found to be related significantly and positively with customer loyalty. The effect of personal friendship appears to have as strong an effect as perceptions of core quality and service encounter satisfaction. Another major finding was that the two relational outcomes of social comfort and social regard both had an indirect influence on customer loyalty. This effect was mediated through the service evaluation constructs of perceived core service quality and service encounter satisfaction. Social comfort affected both quality and satisfaction whereas social regard only influenced quality. However, the impact of social regard on core quality was substantial. Friendship was not found to have a significant relationship with either quality or satisfaction. These findings suggest that there is a temporal dimension to the influence of relational outcomes. Both social regard and social comfort appear to be more important in the early stages of customer-service provider interaction. It also appears that customers evaluate the core quality of everyday services such as hair salons, cafes, and naturopaths using social cues such as feeling well regarded. A further major finding was the lack of a significant relationship between value for money and psychological loyalty in both quantitative studies. Effects of quality, satisfaction, and friendship appear to be important to loyalty development whereas customer value is not. This finding suggests that value for money may be related directly to actual purchase behaviour or repurchase intentions rather than mediated through psychological feelings of loyalty. Hence, evaluations which reflect pricing considerations are less likely to be associated with psychological loyalty than more relationally oriented constructs. The findings indicate important implications for both marketers and researchers. Marketing strategists need to be clear about pursuing either a loyalty or a value for money strategy. The former may not result from the latter. Relational outcomes lead to psychological loyalty but their interactive effects operate differently. Friendship with a service employee provides a direct contribution to loyalty development. Whereas social regard and social comfort affect customers' evaluation of the service. Pursuing a relational strategy will have implications for the way frontline staff are selected and trained. Theoretical implications include: using the relational outcomes as a basis for middle range theory development, support for the linear-additive measurement approach, use of laddering techniques to determine relevant influencing variables, and additional explanatory power to the service recovery literature. In conclusion, a unidimensional construct of psychological loyalty, grounded in service characteristics, was developed, tested, and evaluated for wide application to service industries. Three specific relational antecedents: Friendship, social regard, and social comfort were found to be important to the development of customer loyalty. The research highlighted how these relational outcomes interacted with service evaluation measures to produce loyal customers. Accordingly, Kingstrom's (1983) work has been extended.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer loyalty</field><field name="subject">relational outcomes</field><field name="subject">social comfort</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050914.140054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Law and the Social Production of Space</field><field name="creator">Butler, Christopher</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationship between law and space by focusing on the role of the land-use planning system in producing the space of Australian urban regions.  The primary aim of the project is to demonstrate the significance of the theoretical and sociological framework of Henri Lefebvre for an emerging field of socio-legal studies concerned with the relationship between law and geography. To this point very few contributions to this field have considered the theoretical connections between law and space in any depth.  This thesis demonstrates how Lefebvre's sophisticated theory of the socially produced nature of space can broaden the scope of 'law and geography' research.  It does so through a detailed survey of Lefebvre's work and a deployment of his ideas in a series of inquiries into the production of space in Australia.  This endeavour is pursued in two stages.  Part I of the thesis begins by examining how explanatory models within the social sciences have become increasingly concerned with the spatial dimensions of social life.  This 'spatial turn' is reflected in a small, but growing literature within socio-legal studies which focuses on the interdisciplinary connections between law and geography.  However the theoretical foundations of this field remain underdeveloped.  Through an analysis of Lefebvre's writings, this thesis identifies an anti-reductionist methodological approach to space and its social production.  This is used to establish a theoretical framework for the study of the spatial dimensions of law. Part II of the thesis uses this framework to address two questions about the law-space relationship. The first of these is concerned with how law is involved in the production of space.  This is considered through three linked studies of the production, planning and legal regulation of space.  The starting point for this investigation is the geographical site of suburbia.  Lefebvrean categories are used to redescribe Australian suburbia as a form of abstract space - simultaneously fragmented, homogeneous and hierarchically organised.  The thesis then argues that the land-use planning system in the post-war decades played a significant role in the development of this form of settlement space, by adhering to a form of bureaucratic thinking that Lefebvre characterises as the rationality of habitat.  This rationality embodied technocratic functionalism, a visualised formalism and a structural imposition of expert authority in planning decision-making.  With the shift to a neoliberal state form in the last two decades, there have been significant changes to spatial planning.  Through an analysis and critique of the Integrated Planning Act 1997 (Qld), it is demonstrated that under neoliberalism there has been a reformulation of the rationality of habitat.  In particular, the Integrated Planning Act relies on two new formal strategies, the exchange form and the integrative form, in instituting its changes to planning practice.  The exchange form abolishes the technique of land-use 'zoning' and increases the use of market mechanisms in the designation of spatial uses.  The integrative form restructures the relationships between local and State government agencies and attempts to channel most forms of public participation into the early stages of policy formation.  This thesis argues that rather than changing the spatial outcomes of land-use planning, by commodifying space and restructuring the hierarchies of state decision-making, the Integrated Planning Act will continue to reproduce the social relations of abstract space. The second question in Part II deals with how Lefebvre's ideas can contribute to critical thinking about public law in general.  It is argued that while law plays a significant role as a producer of space through the planning system, processes of spatial production also shape and structure state institutions.  Two areas of research which could benefit from a Lefebvrean theoretical framework are identified.  The first area concerns explanations of the effects on public law of the reterritorialised state form that has emerged under neoliberalism.  The second is the renewal of critical theory in public law.  In particular, the thesis makes the case that the spatial contradiction between the use and exchange values that are attached to space, challenges the normative orthodoxy within public law scholarship which relies on the values of participation and accountability. This thesis contributes to socio-legal research in three important ways.  Firstly, it uses Lefebvre's theoretical approach to develop a critical planning law, linking state planning to the process of the production of space.  Secondly, the thesis uses Lefebvrean categories to link the study of public law to political struggles which surround spatial production.  It suggests a new way for critical legal scholarship to conceptualise public law in terms of the relationship between state power and the inhabitance of space.  Lastly, these inquiries demonstrate the importance and relevance of Lefebvre's social theory for the discipline of socio-legal studies.  By grounding the concept of 'space' in material processes of production, a Lefebvrean approach provides an alternative to existing theoretical accounts within law and geography research and will deepen our understanding of the relationships between legal and spatial relations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">land-use planning</field><field name="subject">urban planning</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Henri Lefebvre</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">spatial</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040521.141805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local Source Influences Upon the Structure of Dust Plumes in the Channel Country of Western Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Butler, Harry</field><field name="description">Most of the early wind erosion research undertaken in Australia, concentrated on how wind erosion affects cultivated farm land. However, in the 1990's the focus of wind erosion research in Australia started to shift to include rangeland environments. Initially these rangeland experiments used experimental configurations that were developed for cultivated fields. This meant that in most cases a sampler was set up in the middle of a field and it was assumed that the data collected was representative of the field as a whole. It was also assumed that temporal changes in dust fluxes/concentration reflect overall changes in the land type erodibility and wind erosivity. However, recent experiments and field observations within the rangelands, of the Channel Country suggest that this assumption is not valid. These experiments and observations suggest that there are substantial spatial and temporal variations in erodibility within individual land types. Such variations complicate the interpretation of temporal and spatial erosion trends. In particular, this variability implies that it is difficult to compare sampler data between different wind erosion events. To begin quantifying and comparing sampler data between events within the rangeland environments, the Dust Source Interaction Simulation Model (DSism) was developed to simulate the effect that physical processes and spatial variations in erodibility have upon observed dust concentration pro- files. The modelling/simulation approach used is closely linked to experimental data via the extensive use of sensitivity testing. Another key feature of the DSism approach, is its flexibility in allowing different dust source areas to have particle emission characteristics. This combined sensitivity testing and simulation approach has provided new insights into the wind erosion processes. By using DSism, it has been possible to identify several key features of the wind erosion process within rangeland environments. The first observation is that spatial and temporal changes in erodibility produce distinct changes in both the vertical and crosswind dust concentration profiles. Further investigations, indicate that the dispersion processes in operation vary from event to event. In particular, the results presented here indicate that surface heating plays an important role in some wind erosion events. These results also suggest that even small variations in the vertical dust concentration profile can reflect temporal and spatial changes in processes and erodibility.  Finally the simulation results show that the particle size distribution of a vertical dust concentration profile depends on (a) the processes in operation during a given event and (b) the spatial variation in the particle size emission characteristics of the various source areas. These findings have several important implications. In particular, they indicate that both the crosswind and vertical dust concentration profiles can be viewed as amalgamation of several distinct plumes from different dust source areas and that dust concentration profiles contain significant information about both the spatial distribution of sources and the processes in operation during any given event. Most field studies have used regression models to describe the variation in dust concentration with height. A problem with this approach is that it assumes that the variation in dust concentration with height, always has a given functional form (or shape) and that dust concentration always decreases with height. Field observations, indicate that this assumption is only valid for some events within rangeland environments and that dust concentration does not always decrease with height in these environments. In most cases, such variations from the regression fit have been assumed to be the result of experimental 'noise' (error) or spatial variations in erodibility. This thesis presents, modelling and field evidence, which suggests that such variations, are the result of a combination of spatial variations in erodibility and changes in thermal conditions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dust plumes</field><field name="subject">Queensland Australia</field><field name="subject">wind erosion</field><field name="subject">Dust Source Interaction Simulation Model</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051103.155627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industrial Relations Processes in Registered Clubs of NSW</field><field name="creator">Buultjens, Jeremy</field><field name="description">The small business sector has become an increasingly important segment of the Australian economy since the 1970s. Industrial relations in the sector have been assumed to be harmonious. However, to a large extent this belief about industrial relations is based on conventional wisdom rather empirical evidence.  Industrial relations research in Australia has concentrated on medium to large businesses because the centralised nature of the industrial relations system encouraged a collective emphasis. This collective emphasis ensured peak representative bodies and larger organisations had a tendency to dominate while small enterprises and their employees were, to a large extent, excluded.  The perceived non-problematic nature of industrial relations in the small business sector was another reason for the lack of focus on the sector.  The low incidence of strike activity and the low levels of trade union membership have meant research has been concentrated on the more "difficult" areas of industrial relations.  The lack of empirical research into industrial relations in the sector is an important shortcoming. There are a number of commentators who suggest that it is too simplistic to assume harmonious relations. It is likely that there is a range of industrial relations in small business, depending on a number of variables including the personality of the owner/manager and employees, the type of business and the current economic climate. The legislative framework will also have an important affect on industrial relations.  This study addresses the lack of empirical research in industrial relations in the small business sector by examining the differences between small and large registered clubs in NSW. Registered clubs have an unusual ownership structure and unusual business goals.  They are also unusual since they are non-profit organisations formed by groups of people who share a common interest and who have come together to pursue or promote that interest. Registered clubs are governed by a board of directors who are responsible for the formulation of policy and for ensuring that management carries out these policies.  This study found that there were significant differences in regards to some aspects of employment relations.  For example, small clubs were more likely to have lower rates of unionisation than large clubs.  They were also likely to have lower levels of informal bargaining than large clubs.  The methods of communication within the workplace were likely to be more informal in small clubs and they were less likely to have communications with a trade union. Despite this greater degree of informality in employment relations, small clubs were more likely to use award provisions to determine wages for their managers and employees.  Interestingly, despite the lower level of unionisation and the greater use of awards by smaller clubs there were no significant differences between small and large club managers' perception of the impact of awards and trade unions on club flexibility. The findings from this study suggest the deregulation of the Australian industrial relations system may not have any significant benefits for small business.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">registered clubs</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">industrial relations</field><field name="subject">workplace relations</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">small businesses</field><field name="subject">small enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040514.140227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Alignments in Ritual, Ceremony and Celebration</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Roger Neil</field><field name="description">Increasingly, cultural workers and artists from many disciplines are finding themselves involved in the creation of public and private rituals, ceremonies and celebrations. Focusing on ritual and celebration in Australian contexts, this thesis posits a new categorisation of the types of event that might be encountered, grouping and examining them according to their action upon participants with the aim of enabling a more practical methodology of design in contemporary societal conditions. Existing categories, which have defined these age-old activities in terms of anthropological observation or social intention, must now be regarded as obsolete because they take no account of rapid and widespread changes in degrees of adherence to traditional belief systems, in social orientation and in Western cultural practices. There is a need to reappraise why individuals and communities might continue to hold rituals and celebrations, and how these can be designed, managed and operated most effectively.  The thesis identifies four major categories of ritual: Transformation, Reinforcement, Transcendence and Catharsis. It argues that, by recognising the differences between how each category operates for participants and also certain commonalities across categories, effectiveness of design is facilitated. In developing parameters for each category and giving examples of contemporary praxis, the writer stresses the importance of understanding traditional ceremonies so that elements of a rich repertoire of techniques developed over long periods can be planned into new rituals for contemporary application, despite the dissipation of shared, coherent belief systems in a highly secularised culture. This impels consideration of questions of cultural sensitivity, raises the need for close community involvement in design, and requires exploration of managing the challenges of multiple signification. Contemporary cultural contexts for ritual and celebratory events are marked by plurality, multi-vocalism and multicultural experience. Designers thus need to achieve, out of difference, an event that produces coherence, deep effects for each participant and a sense of shared experience. The thesis demonstrates means to this end through informed praxis, that is, by practitioners ensuring that theory and practice are working together in these complex contexts that involve the well being of individuals and communities. The categories have been identified through investigations into the literature of myth, ritual and celebration, helpful frameworks developed in cognitive science, and extensive research provided by thirty years of practice in the field. As a designer and director of rituals and celebrations, the writer seeks both to confirm the importance of the artist within the process and to demonstrate a new, practical, ethically located and effective approach for the education of intending practitioners. No claim is made that the four categories are definitive or mutually exclusive of one another. It is accepted that in many situations the categories might coalesce, be added to and/or fragment. However, the categorisation provides a fresh vantage point from which to view the potentially powerful effects of ritual experience, an effective tool of construction for the use of artists and cultural activists working in this field, and an informed basis for praxis. In developing this new categorisation the writer argues an ongoing need for rituals and celebrations to clarify and enrich the lives of individuals and the community while stressing the importance of careful and appropriate design of such events.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ritual</field><field name="subject">rituals</field><field name="subject">belief systems</field><field name="subject">beliefs</field><field name="subject">celebration</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">West</field><field name="subject">Western</field><field name="subject">myth</field><field name="subject">mythology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050627.105721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flow Variability and Vegetation Dynamics in a Large Arid Floodplain: Cooper Creek, Australia</field><field name="creator">Capon, Samantha Jane</field><field name="description">Throughout arid and semi-arid inland Australia, many extensive floodplains occur in association with rivers which are amongst the most hydrologically variable in the world.  As rainfall in these areas is characteristically low and patchy, conditions in Australia's 'dryland' floodplains fluctuate unpredictably between extended periods of drought and huge floods that transform vast areas into wetlands, often for months at a time.  Vegetation in these floodplains is commonly dominated by short grass and forb associations and patches of open succulent shrubland which are attributed with high ecological and socio-economic values due to their provision of habitat to a diverse array of terrestrial and aquatic fauna and their productive native pasture growth.  In temperate and tropical floodplains, a substantial number of studies have shown that plant community composition and structure is determined primarily by flow and alterations to flow in these areas, through water extraction or river regulation, have resulted in many changes to the vegetation including loss of biodiversity and mass invasions of exotic species.  Despite increasing pressure for water resource development in 'dryland' regions, relatively little is known regarding the effects of highly variable flows on the vegetation dynamics of arid floodplains, particularly in Australia.  This thesis addresses this knowledge gap by examining the role of flow in the vegetation dynamics of a large arid floodplain in central Australia: the Cooper Creek floodplain.  The effects of flow on plant community dynamics, from an organism level to that of the landscape, are examined across a range of spatial and temporal scales.  Results are presented from a two year temporal vegetation survey during which time two flood pulse events of differing sizes occurred.  A large-scale spatial survey was also conducted to determine the effects of flood history on spatial variation in plant community composition and structure.  The composition of the soil seed bank and its contribution to vegetation dynamics were additionally investigated through a series of germination trials.  Amongst common arid floodplain plants, life history traits that enable persistence under variable hydrological conditions were also considered via several experiments aimed at determining the effects of flow on the outcomes of various life history stages including germination, growth and dispersal.  Throughout the study, results are presented for plant groups that were predefined on the basis of life form, life span and taxonomic divisions within these categories.  Plant community composition and structure in the Cooper Creek floodplain exhibits significant shifts both temporally, in response to flood pulse wetting and drying, and spatially, in response to flood history.  Flood pulse inundation has the potential to influence each life history stage across the range of plant groups present and the outcomes of these appear to be determined by hydrological attributes such as flood pulse timing, duration and rate of drawdown.  Vegetation consequently exhibits gradual zonation on a gradient of flood frequency along which plant groups occur at predictable locations depending on their life history traits and recent hydrological conditions.  A substantial proportion of species display ruderal life history traits including large, persistent soil seed banks and rapid life cycles which enable escape in time from the stresses associated with flooding and drought.  These species, mostly comprising annual monocots and forbs, are widespread throughout the landscape and their presence in the extant vegetation is related primarily to the time since the last flood pulse event and the hydrological attributes of this.  Perennial species, particularly shrubs, do not appear to rely similarly on the soil seed bank for recruitment and their distribution in the floodplain vegetation is likely to be determined more by their ability to tolerate either flooding or drought.  Overall, this study demonstrates that flow, despite its variability, has an overriding influence on vegetation dynamics in the arid floodplain of the Cooper Creek.  The spatial and temporal variability of flow maintains a heterogeneous mosaic of plant communities of differing composition and structure.  Given this close relationship between flow and vegetation dynamics, anthropogenic alterations to flow are likely to result in changes to the vegetation including homogenisation of plant communities across the floodplain landscape and eventual loss of biodiversity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">stream flow</field><field name="subject">river</field><field name="subject">rivers</field><field name="subject">stream</field><field name="subject">streams</field><field name="subject">floodplain</field><field name="subject">floodplains</field><field name="subject">arid</field><field name="subject">vegetation</field><field name="subject">plant communities</field><field name="subject">germination</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">dispersal</field><field name="subject">variable</field><field name="subject">variability</field><field name="subject">soil seed banks</field><field name="subject">drought</field><field name="subject">flood</field><field name="subject">flooding</field><field name="subject">dryland</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Cooper Creek</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040513.110733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Contemporary and Historical Processes on Population Genetic Structure of Two Freshwater Species in Dryland River Systems (Western Queensland, Australia)</field><field name="creator">Carini, Giovannella</field><field name="description">Arid and semiarid river systems in Western Queensland, Australia, are characterized by the unpredictable and highly variable nature of their hydrological regimes as a result of the episodic nature of rain events in the region. These dryland rivers typically experience episodic floods and extremely low or no flow periods. During low or no flow periods, water persists only in relatively wide and deep sections of the river channels, which are called 'waterholes'. These isolated waterholes serve as refugia for aquatic species during protracted intervals between floods. In such discontinuous riverine habitat, dispersal of freshwater species may be achieved only during wet seasons, when water is flowing in rivers and the nearby floodplains. Obligate aquatic species occur in habitats that represent discrete sites surrounded by inhospitable terrestrial landscapes. Thus, movements are very much limited by the physical nature and arrangement of the riverine system. In addition, the distribution of a species may be also largely dependent on historical events. Landscape and river courses continually change over geological time, often leaving distinct phylogenetic 'signatures', useful in reconciling species' biology with population connectivity and earth history. The main aim of this study was to resolve the relative importance of contemporary and historical processes in structuring populations of two freshwater species in Western Queensland river systems. To address this aim, a comparative approach was taken in analysing patterns of genetic variation of two freshwater invertebrates: a snail (Notopala sublineata) and a prawn (Macrobrachium australiense). Mitochondrial sequences were used for both the species. In addition, allozyme and microsatellites markers were employed for N. sublineata.  These species have similar distributions in Western Queensland region, although N. sublineata appears to be extinct in some catchments. M. australiense is thought to have good dispersal abilities due to a planktonic larval phase in its life cycle and good swimming capabilities, whereas N. sublineata is thought to have limited dispersal abilities, because of its benthic behaviour and because this species is viviparous. It was hypothesised that these freshwater invertebrates, would display high levels of genetic structure in populations, because physical barriers represented by terrestrial inhospitable habitat, are likely to impede gene flow between populations inhabiting isolated river pools. Genetic data for the two species targeted in this study supported this hypothesis, indicating strong population subdivision at all spatial scales investigated (i.e. between and within catchments).  This suggests that contemporary dispersal between isolated waterholes is relatively restricted, despite the potential good dispersal abilities of one of the species. It was hypothesised that levels of gene flow between populations of aquatic species were higher during the Quaternary (likely movements of individuals across catchment boundaries) and that they have been isolated relatively recently. There is evidence that historically gene flow was occurring between populations, suggesting that episodic dispersal across catchment boundaries was likelier in the past. Episodic historical movements of aquatic fauna were facilitated by higher patterns of river connectivity as a result of the climate changes of the Pleistocene. Because the two species targeted in this study exhibit analogous spatial patterns of evolutionary subdivision it is likely that they have a shared biogeographic history. The unpredictable flow regime of rivers in Western Queensland is likely to have considerable effects on the genetic diversity of aquatic populations. First, if populations of obligate freshwater organisms inhabiting less persistent waterholes are more likely to experience periodic bottlenecks than those inhabiting more persistent ones, they would be expected to have lower levels of genetic diversity. Second, if populations inhabiting less persistent waterholes periodically undergo local extinction with subsequent recolonisation, there should be higher levels of genetic differentiation among them, due to the founder effects, than among those populations inhabiting more persistent waterholes. Contrary to the first prediction, the observed levels of genetic diversity in both N. sublineata and M. australiense were high in both more persistent and less persistent waterholes. There was no tendency for genetic diversity to be lower in less persistent than in more persistent waterholes. However, when Cooper waterholes were ranked in order of persistence, positive correlation between water persistence time in waterholes and genetic diversity was detected in N. sublineata but not in M. australiense. Contrary to the second prediction, highly significant genetic differentiation was found among populations from both less persistent and more persistent waterholes. This indicates that not only populations from less persistent but also those from more persistent waterholes were very dissimilar genetically.  This study demonstrated the importance of both contemporary and historical processes in shaping the population structure of obligate freshwater species in Western Queensland river systems. It has indicated that contemporary movements of freshwater species generally are extremely limited across the region, whereas episodic dispersal across catchment boundaries was possible during the Pleistocene, due to different patterns of river connectivity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dryland rivers</field><field name="subject">arid rivers</field><field name="subject">semiarid rivers</field><field name="subject">river</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">freshwater invertebrates</field><field name="subject">Notopala sublineata</field><field name="subject">Macrobrachium australiense</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050113.081250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Analysis of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer</field><field name="creator">Carless, Melanie</field><field name="description">Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer in the world with a lifetime risk for development as high as 2 in 3 in Queensland, Australia. Mortality is quite low, representing an approximate 360 deaths in Australia annually but cost of treatment is extremely high, estimated at $232 million each year. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are the two most common forms of NMSC. Although BCC generally do not have the propensity to metastasise, they are highly invasive and can be locally destructive. SCC on the other hand is invasive and has metastatic potential. SCC is generally derived from a precursor lesion, solar keratosis (SK), which is also considered to be a biomarker of BCC, SCC and malignant melanoma. According to one theory, SKs actually represent the first recognisable stage of SCC development and therefore may be indicative of the earliest stage of NMSC development. In addition to these common forms of NMSC, rarer forms such as keratoacanthoma (KA), which spontaneously regress, and SCC in situ, which rarely become invasive, may provide clues into protective mechanisms associated with prevention of development. Like all other cancers, NMSC arises from an accumulation of genetic abnormalities that result in severe cellular dysfunction. A number of genes have been proposed in the development of NMSC, including p53, CDKN2a, Bcl-2 and the Ras family of genes, which are typically associated with proliferative and differentiation processes. Also, a number of genetic disorders that predispose individuals to NMSC have also been identified. Genetic abnormalities in these genes may be a result of somatic mutations that may be promoted by environmental carcinogens. For NMSC, ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the primary environmental stimulus that acts upon skin to generate mutations. UV effects are 2-fold; the first being direct damage produced by UVB radiation and the second being indirect damage as a result of UVA-induced oxidative stress. In addition to mutations of genes that directly result in carcinogenesis, polymorphic variants of genes may also play a role in susceptibility to NMSC. These susceptibility genes may have immunogenic, detoxifying or transcriptional roles that could be involved in increased mutagenesis or activation of cancer causing genes. The purpose of this study was ultimately to identify further molecular based mechanisms associated with the development of non-melanoma skin cancer. Initially, this study aimed to examine the effects of aberrant chromosomal regions on NMSC development and also to identify candidate genes within these regions that may be implicated in the development and progression of NMSC. Also, based on chromosomal and functional implications, a number of candidate genes were assessed using association analysis to determine their involvement in susceptibility to the earliest stages of NMSC development. Implicated susceptibility genes were then further investigated to determine their response to UV radiation. Therefore the methodological approach of these studies was based on three broad technical applications of cytogenetic, association and expression analyses. Previous comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) studies implicated the 18q chromosomal region in progression of SK to SCC and this region was therefore suspected of harbouring one or more tumour suppressor genes that were associated with a more malignant phenotype. Following on from this analysis, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis was used for further delineation of this region and possibly to implicate candidate genes involved in progression. Additionally, CGH was used to investigate keratoacanthoma to determine aberrant regions that might be involved in progression and also regression of this NMSC. Genes that had potential functional roles in NMSC development and that were located in or near regions implicated by these cytogenetic analyses were further investigated using association analysis. Association analysis was performed using polymerase chain reaction and subsequent restriction enzyme digestion or GeneScan analysis to determine genotype and allele frequencies in an SK affected versus control population for polymorphisms within a number of candidate genes. This population was carefully phenotyped so that not only genotypic factors could be analysed but also their interaction with a number of phenotypic and environmental risk factors. Genes with polymorphisms that did show association with solar keratosis development were then examined functionally. Specifically, gene expression analysis was undertaken to investigate their response to UV radiation. Both UVA only and combined UVA/UVB treatments were used for short term irradiation and also for long term irradiation with recovery to determine differential effects of UV range and dose in human skin. Relative mRNA expression analysis of these genes was performed using quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to determine if UV radiation imposed gene expression changes in the skin. A combination of these methodologies provided a wide basis for investigation of NMSC. Cytogenetic, association and expression analyses all allow for the identification of molecular risk factors that cause or are associated with NMSC development and progression. These analyses provided diverse results that implicated various molecular mechanisms in the development of NMSC. Cytogenetic analysis is a powerful technique, especially for the identification of a broad range of aberrations throughout the genome. This study employed LOH analysis to investigate an implicated region involved in progression to SCC and to attempt identification of candidate genes that may be involved in this process. LOH analysis was successfully performed on 9 SCCs, 5 SCCs in situ and 2 SKs using 8 microsatellite markers within the 18q region. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify polymorphic regions of these markers and genotypic composition was determined for normal and cancerous tissue within the specimen. In heterozygote individuals, determined by analysis of normal tissue, the cancerous tissue was examined to determine if alleles within the implicated region had been lost. However, after analysis of multiple different samples, there was no LOH detected in any of the samples examined for this analysis. This does not necessarily reject a role for 18q, or genes within this region, as the localisation of candidate tumour suppressor genes within a small region may indicate a tighter region of involvement than was expected. As such, a more targeted study may further delineate this region and implicate candidate genes in progression of SK to the more malignant phenotype of SCC. Further CGH analysis of keratoacanthoma was also undertaken to identify aberrations associated with development and also regression of this skin cancer. CGH was performed using universal amplification and nick translation to incorporate a fluorescent dye. Differentially labelled normal and tumour DNA were then competitively hybridised to a normal metaphase spread and fluorescence emission indicated either amplification or deletion of specific chromosomal regions. In total, 6 KA samples were analysed, with 2 samples each from evolving, matured and regressing stages of KA development. In general, regressing KAs appeared to be more highly associated with deleted regions than evolving and matured KAs. Specifically, the 15q chromosomal region that was deleted in regressing KAs but amplified in evolving or matured KAs, may be significantly involved in the process of KA regression. Also various candidate genes that were being considered for analysis were located in or near some of these implicated regions, including GSTM1, GSTP1 and SSTR2. As such, these candidate genes were targeted for further investigation. A number of susceptibility genes that were located in or near aberrant regions implicated in NMSC development were investigated using association analysis. These genes included members of the somatostatin receptor family (SSTR1 and SSTR2), members of the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) family (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 and GSTZ1) and the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Studies detected a number of interesting interactions between genetic, environmental and phenotypic factors in the development of the early stages of non-melanoma skin cancer. Additionally, genes implicated in NMSC development were further investigated using expression analysis to determine response to UV radiation. Association analysis was initially performed on members of the somatostatin receptor family. Somatostatin is a growth inhibiting factor, amongst other things, that mediates its actions through the somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). The presence of these receptors (SSTR1-5) in tumour cells indicates a potential for somatostatin to bind and suppress growth, as well as allowing for therapeutic treatment with somatostatin analogues. Additionally, expression of these receptors in normal tissue, including skin, should allow for potential protection against tumour growth. The genes for SSTR1 and SSTR2 have been shown to contain dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms, and although these polymorphisms may not directly result in altered expression or binding potential, they may be linked to another functional polymorphism that does. Using association analysis the SSTR1 and SSTR2 genes were investigated to determine whether they play a role in the development of solar keratosis. Results showed that there were no significant differences between SSTR1 and SSTR2 polymorphism frequencies in the tested solar keratosis population (P = 0.10 and P = 0.883, respectively) as compared to an unaffected population. Hence, these studies do not support a role for the SSTR1 or SSTR2 genes in solar keratosis development. Further association analysis and subsequent expression analysis was also performed on members of the glutathione-S-transferase family. The GST enzymes play a role in the detoxification of a number of carcinogens and mutagens, including those produced by UV-induced oxidative stress. This study examined the role of GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 and GSTZ1 gene polymorphisms in susceptibility to SK development. Association analysis was performed to detect allele and genotype frequency differences in SK affected and control populations using PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. No significant differences were detected in GSTP1 and GSTZ1 allele or genotype frequencies, however polymorphisms within both genes were found to be in linkage disequilibrium, as previously reported, and a new allelic variant of the GSTZ1 gene was identified. Significant associations between GSTM1 (P = 0.003) and GSTT1 (P = 0.039) genotypes and SK development were detected, with the null variants of both genes conferring an approximate 2-fold increase in risk for solar keratosis development (OR: 2.1; CI: 1.3-3.5 and OR: 2.3; CI: 1.0-5.0 for GSTM1 and GSTT1, respectively). For the GSTM1 gene, this risk was significantly higher in conjunction with high outdoor exposure (OR: 3.4; CI: 1.9-6.3) and although the GSTT1 gene showed a similar trend (OR: 2.9; CI: 1.1-7.7), this did not reach significance. The increased risk of SK development associated with these genes is likely due to a decreased ability of the skin to detoxify mutagenic compounds produced by UV-induced oxidative stress, and hence a decreased ability to protect against carcinogenesis. Implication of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null variants in solar keratosis development prompted interest in analysis of gene expression changes in response to UV radiation. Due to the high homology of the GSTM1 gene with other GSTM genes, and therefore potential issues with primer specificity, the GSTT1 gene was focussed on for the expression studies. Real time reverse transcription PCR, incorporating SYBR green fluorescence and 18S as a comparative gene, was used to study GSTT1 gene expression changes in response to both UVA and combined UVA/UVB radiation. It was found that only short term UV radiation had an effect on GSTT1 expression changes, whereas no alteration of gene expression was seen after 4 and 12 hours of recovery from long term irradiation between irradiated and matched non-irradiated skin samples. This indicated that changes in gene expression for the GSTT1 gene apparently occur relatively quickly after exposure to UV radiation. Analysis of both UVA only and combined UVA/UVB short term irradiation indicated that an initial decrease in expression, followed by an increase was likely to represent translation into protein and subsequent transcription of mRNA, and in some cases a second decrease indicated further translation. Hence, it appears as though UV radiation does have a significant effect on the expression of at least one GST gene, and that UV radiation in combination with genetic variation of these genes may play a role in the development of NMSC. Finally, association and subsequent expression analysis was also performed on the vitamin D receptor. The hormonal form of vitamin D, 1a25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, has been shown to have numerous cancer-related effects, including antiproliferative, differentiation, proapoptotic and antiangiogenic effects. These effects are mediated through the binding of 1a25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 to the vitamin D receptor and subsequent transcriptional pathways. Polymorphisms within the VDR are known to regulate its transcription and therefore expression, which is linked to the ability of 1a25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 to bind. Association analysis of a 5&#146; initiation codon variant (Fok I) and two 3&#146; variants (Apa I and Taq I) was performed in SK affected and control populations. Although the Fok I variant showed no association with SK development, both the Apa I and Taq I variants were found to be associated with SK development (P = 0.043 and P = 0.012, respectively). In particular, the Aa and Tt genotypes were associated with increased risk of SK. These results were however more complicated, as shown by further analysis. This showed that genotypes containing at least one allele that conferred decreased VDR transcription (ie. AA/Aa and Tt/tt) increased risk of SK development by 2-fold in fair skinned individuals (OR: 2.1; CI: 1.2-3.7 and OR: 1.7; CI: 1.1-2.7 for Apa I and Taq I variants, respectively) but also found to decrease the risk of SK development by 2-fold in medium skinned individuals (OR: 0.5; CI: 0.3-1.0 for Apa I variants). Additionally, genotypes containing 2 alleles conferring decreased transcription of the VDR gene were found to further increase the risk for SK development in fair skinned individuals (OR: 2.5; CI: 1.4-4.5 and OR: 2.4; CI: 1.2-5.0 for Apa I and Taq I variants, respectively), indicating a possible additive effect for the alleles. The highly differential association of the VDR gene polymorphisms amongst phenotypes may reflect a combination between the ability of an individual to synthesise 1a25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 with the binding availability of the VDR. To further investigate the role of VDR in NMSC, expression analysis of the VDR gene was undertaken using real time reverse transcription PCR, with SYBR green fluorescence and 18S as a comparative gene, to examine expression pattern changes associated with UV radiation. It was found that short term irradiation, as well as long term irradiation and recovery were associated with gene expression changes. Short term irradiation resulted in patterns indicative of translation and subsequent transcription, whereas long term irradiated samples resulted in reduction of VDR expression that was recovered after an extended period of time. Thus, VDR expression is clearly influenced by UV exposure. It would be very interesting to see more specifically if particular VDR genotypes, which appear to play a role in NMSC risk, also are affected differentially by UV exposure. It is possible that VDR expression is reduced to limit excessive binding of 1a25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, although since both UVA and UVB radiation affect VDR expression, this may not be mediated the effect of 1a25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 but rather a different pathway resulting from a general UV response. In summary, the detection of a number of susceptibility genes involved in SK development and their subsequent expression analysis in response to UV radiation has given further insight into the molecular changes associated with NMSC. In fact, both detoxification genes (GSTM1 and GSTT1) and a transcription related gene (VDR), were found to confer susceptibility to solar keratosis, an early stage skin lesion with tumourigenic potential. This suggests that even the earliest stages of skin cancer are mediated through a wide range of effects. Additionally, expression changes related to these genes indicate that they are associated with the well known environmental carcinogen of UV radiation and that their effects may be mediated through a wide range of pathways. Although implication of the 18q region in SCC progression was not confirmed in this study, it is still likely to play a role in malignant transformation. The implication of this region, as well as the implication of susceptibility genes has vastly increased knowledge into processes associated with NMSC. Although additional analysis can confirm and further implicate these molecular alterations, this study has resulted in a more comprehensive understanding of NMSC that may ultimately be of benefit in terms of prognosis and treatment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">skin cancer</field><field name="subject">non-melanoma skin cancer</field><field name="subject">squamous cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">basal cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">molecular analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041101.123114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Servicing the Subject: a Feminist Re-appraisal of Prostitution</field><field name="creator">Carpenter, Belinda</field><field name="description">This thesis examines theoretical and popular ways of knowing the prostitute and the client. Its purpose is to intervene in contemporary ways of knowing and articulate a more consistent feminist stance on prostitution. Currently, the prostitute is known predominantly through the discourse of psychology whilst the client is known through the discourse of sexology. She is deviant and he is normal. She is a victim and he is an agent. The issue of inconsistency in the feminist stance on prostitution is related to the recognition that these dualisms figure in the way in which all knowledge of the client and the prostitute is organised. Within feminist theory the prostitute is known through the dualism of victim and agent whilst the client is known through the sex/gender distinction. The former perpetuates certain ways of knowing the prostitute that cannot embrace the complexity and ambivalence of prostitution for women. If she is a victim she is only passive and exploited. If she is an agent she is both active and free. Utilising the latter allows the client to escape scrutiny. This thesis will argue that this is for two reasons. Firstly, because feminists have tended to support the idea of the prostitute as agent within the victim/agent dichotomy. Within such a way of knowing, any critique of the client became a critique of the livelihood of the prostitute, and is best avoided. Secondly, because feminists tend to work within the sex/gender distinction and its associated dualisms of mind and body, nature and culture. As such, they tend to perpetuate, rather than challenge, the sexological relationship between the sexual and the social. In both analyses, the sexual urge is ultimately natural, albeit modified by society. Analyses that argue for the social constitution of sexuality (rather than simply its social construction) still perpetuate the sex/gender distinction by claiming the validity of the mind/body dualism for their analyse. This thesis will argue that these dualisms structure an impossible choice for feminists and help to position them within the divisive prostitution debate. In a political climate that perpetuates only two ways of knowing prostitution, to critique prostitution is to be anti-sex, moralising, prudish and conservative. In contrast, to support prostitution is hailed as pro-sex, pro-women and pro-choice. Within this dichotomising of the political issue, feminists gain either conservative or libertarian allies. Within such a political climate, a consistent feminist position is lost. In order to counter this political and theoretical inconsistency, this thesis argues for a connection between the dualisms through the organisation of modern liberal democracies. To know the prostitute through the victim/agent dichotomy and the client through the sex/gender distinction (and associated dualisms of mind and body, nature and culture) is also to call upon the public/private split as their organising feature. The public/private split gives meaning to the dualisms of victim and agent, sex and gender, mind and body, through its role in the perpetuation of associations between victim, body, sex, private and women, and between agent, gender, mind, public and men. This thesis will argue that these dualisms are not useful for explaining the ambivalent and contradictory status of prostitution as both work and sex, public and private, rational and irrational, embodied and disembodied, sexual and social. However, not only does prostitution challenge the explanatory value of these dualisms, but the experience of prostitution for the prostitute and the client both subverts and inverts these dualisms. The usual configuration of the dualisms public/private, worker/consumer, male/female, mind/body, rationality/irrationality, are public, worker, male, mind, rationality, in contrast to private, consumer, female, body, irrationality. The prostitute is positioned in and through modern liberal democracies as embodied, but claims the status of worker through her experience of disembodiment. The client is positioned in and through modern liberal democracies as disembodied, and continues this proprietorial relationship with his body during the prostitution contract. She becomes the embodied worker and he becomes the disembodied sex partner. This further demonstrates the inability of a dualistic conception of prostitution to take into account the ambivalent and contradictory status of the prostitute and the client. Whilst this thesis will suggest that such an ambivalent status is to be found in all relations between men and women in modern liberal democracies, it will also propose the political implications of this theoretical reconfiguration for the feminist position on prostitution.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prostitution</field><field name="subject">feminist theory</field><field name="subject">dualism of victim</field><field name="subject">dualism of agent</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051109.134329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing Their Own Affairs: The Australian Deaf Community During the 1920s and 1930s</field><field name="creator">Carty, Bridget Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development of and interrelationships among organisations in the Australian Deaf community during the early part of the 20th Century, particularly during the 1920s and 1930s. It focuses on those organisations which Deaf people attempted to establish themselves, or with hearing supporters, in response to their rejection of the philosophy and practices of the existing charitable organisations such as Deaf Societies and Missions. It also analyses the responses of the Societies and Missions to these moves. The thesis adopts a social history perspective, describing events as much as possible from the perspective of the Deaf people of the time. These developments within the Deaf community were influenced by wider social movements in Australian society during these decades, such as the articulation of minority groups as 'citizens', and their search for 'advancement', autonomy and equal rights. Australia's first schools and post-school organisations for Deaf people were closely modelled on 19th Century British institutions. The thesis describes the development of these early Australian institutions and argues that Deaf people had active or contributing roles in many of them. During the early 20th Century most of these organisations came under closer control of hearing people, and Deaf people's roles became marginalised. During the late 1920s many Deaf adults began to resist the control of Societies and Missions, instead aspiring to 'manage their own affairs'. In two states, working with hearing supporters, they successfully established alternative organisations or 'breakaways', and in another state they engaged in protracted but unsuccessful struggles with the Deaf Society. Australian Deaf people established a national organisation in the 1930s, and this led to the creation of an opposing national organisation by the Societies. Most of these new organisations did not survive beyond the 1930s, but they significantly affected the power structures and relationships between Deaf and hearing people in Australia for several decades afterwards. These events have been largely ignored and even strategically suppressed by later generations, possibly for reasons which parallel other episodes of amnesia and silence in Australian history.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian deaf community</field><field name="subject">Deaf Societies</field><field name="subject">minority groups</field><field name="subject">hearing impaired</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060123.131332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Internal Functioning of Cross-Functional Teams: A Social Identity Theory Based Process</field><field name="creator">Cassematis, Peter</field><field name="description">Cross-functional teams are becoming increasingly common in organisations.  However, a large proportion of these teams fail to meet their full potential as social and productive units. The present research was conducted under the assumption that a cross-functional team involves simultaneous intragroup and intergroup contact.  The failure of cross-functional teams often involves the neglect of normal social psychological processes that occur in intergroup contexts that may potentially be employed to increase the likelihood of success with cross-functional teams.  The social identity theory approach to intergroup relations was used to formulate two identity management strategies intended to improve the functioning of a cross-functional team.  One strategy involved social interaction within an intragroup social frame.  The intragroup aspect was apparent in that there was no outgroup present, with participants operating at the intergroup level of psychological processing after exposure to (successful) pre-task manipulations intended to facilitate acceptance of the task group social identity. The intragroup identity management process required increasing pre-task salience of the task group social identity, absence of any outgroup, wearing a team uniform, and performance of an intellectually challenging problem solving as a group.  A second identity management process was based in an intergroup social frame.  The intergroup procedure involved pre-task manipulation of social identity, wearing of a team uniform, and performance of a physically and intellectually involving problem solving task in a competitive intergroup social frame.  Two separate studies were performed. In Study one, 110 university students were randomly assigned to 'mono-functional' teams (teams with no obvious basis for internal intergroup differentiation).  The relative efficacy of either of the two identity management processes was assessed with regards to changes in social identity, subjective uncertainty, conceptualisation of the aggregate, similarity, heterogeneity, effort, and trust.  Pre-post within groups differences were analysed Improving functioning of cross-functional teams by repeated measures ANOVA.  Between groups differences were analysed with ANCOVA.  The results indicated both identity management strategies resulted in improved team functioning. In general, neither strategy was notably superior to the other, however there was less subjective uncertainty reported by participants from the intragroup condition than those from the intergroup condition due to the effect of losing the competition.  Participants from losing teams also became more aware of 'subgroups within the single group' than those from the intragroup condition.  Participants from the intergroup condition were less likely to think of themselves as separate individuals than participants from the intragroup condition.  The social identity theory approach to intergroup relations was useful for interpreting the results as well as developing the two strategies which suggests SIT/SCT provide a potentially useful conceptual base from which to develop team building processes in mono-functional teams. In study 2, 110 university students were assigned to cross-functional teams (composite task groups containing three academic subgroups).  The identity management processes used in Study one were extended by drawing participant attention to the presence of subgroups within the cross-functional teams.  The intragroup process involved pre-task manipulation of social identity, wearing uniforms which denoted both task group and subgroup membership, and performance of an intellectually challenging problem solving task which was performed with out an outgroup present.  The intergroup identity management strategy involved pre-task manipulation of social identity, performance of a physically and intellectually involving problem solving task requiring integration of subgroup knowledge and inter-functional cooperation within a competitive intergroup context.  As in the intragroup condition, participants were made aware of the social complexity of the task group through their uniforms.  Participants responded differently to the two identity management processes, with the intergroup strategy proving more beneficial than the intragroup strategy.  The intragroup process was marked by non-significant pre-post differences, indicating neither Improving functioning of cross-functional teams a marked improvement nor decline in group functioning.  In contrast, participants from the intergroup condition reported results indicating increased post-task self-definition with the cross-functional team, increased trust, and higher effort.  Losing the competition did not impact on post-task levels of any dependent variable with the exception of subjective uncertainty, where 'winners' reported less uncertainty than 'losers'.  The intergroup condition gave rise to the most potential perceived 'distinctiveness threat'; however there was no sign of any threat across the array of dependent variables.  Therefore it can be suggested that the intergroup identity management strategy provided some protection to the cross-functional team from the negative impact of inter-functional distinctiveness threat.  All results could be explained with recourse to the concepts of SIT/SCT which suggests social identity theory has utility for interpreting results as well as developing team building processes in cross-functional teams.  Future research in cross-functional team settings would benefit from the development of comprehensive measures of uncertainty, status, and heterogeneity with item content drawn from social identity and self-categorisation theories.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cross- functional teams</field><field name="subject">intragroup contact</field><field name="subject">intergroup contact</field><field name="subject">social identity</field><field name="subject">self-categorisation theories</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070710.134636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative Analyses of Successful Establishment Among Introduced Land Birds</field><field name="creator">Cassey, Phillip</field><field name="description">Humankind has redistributed a large number of species outside their native geographic ranges. Although the majority of introduction attempts fail to establish populations, the cumulative negative effect of successful non-native species has been and will continue to be large. Historical records of land bird introductions provide one of the richest sources of data for testing hypotheses regarding the factors that affect the successful establishment of non-native populations. However, despite comprehensive summaries of global avian introductions dating back two decades only very recent studies have examined the successful establishment of non-native bird species worldwide. It is clear that a non-random pattern exists in the types of land bird species that have been chosen by humans to be introduced outside their native range. Out of the 44 avian families from which species have been chosen for introduction almost 70% of introduction attempts have been from just five families (Phasianidae, Passeridae, Fringillidae, Columbidae, Psittacidae). Notably, these families include game species, insectivorous song birds, and species from the pet trade. It has been hypothesised that the fate of introduced species may be determined in part by heritable characteristics that are shared by closely related taxa. In my analyses, I have used current comparative methods to demonstrate that intrinsic eco-physiological characteristics are significant predictors of the worldwide success of introduced land bird species. The results of my analyses contribute to a greater ecological understanding of the traits that correlate with the successful establishment of non-native species. Notably, the three major conclusions that I have drawn from this thesis are: 1. Non-random patterns of successful establishment exist for introduced land bird taxa that have experienced a repeated number of introduction attempts. This result supports the idea that introduced species have an inherent likelihood of either succeeding or failing to establish non-native populations. 2. Eco-physiological traits are important correlates for determining the variability in introduction outcome for non-native land bird species. With reliable information on introduction attempts and taxa-specific traits predictive models are possible that quantify the outcome of repeated introduction attempts across non-native species. 3. Islands are not universally less resistant than mainland regions to the successful establishment of non-native species. This perception is a reflection of the greater number of introduction attempts to islands rather than an effect of biotic resistance. Any differences in the success of introduction attempts can be attributed largely to differences in the proportion of introductions that have been made across biogeographic regions. I have highlighted that data are accessible for global analyses of the variability in the successful establishment of non-native species. Although establishment success is not a deterministic process, the characteristics of an introduced species can influence the probability of its succeeding. I have shown that with adequate eco-physiological information, and for introduced land bird species at least, this probability can be predicted. These results refute previous suggestions that the stochastic component of species introductions will always overshadow any emerging patterns of successful establishment among non-native populations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">introduced species</field><field name="subject">introduced animals</field><field name="subject">introduced birds</field><field name="subject">non-native species</field><field name="subject">non-native animals</field><field name="subject">non-native birds</field><field name="subject">biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030915.094001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Evaluation of Software Development Practice and Assessment-Based Process Improvement in Small Software Development Firms</field><field name="creator">Cater-Steel, Aileen Patricia</field><field name="description">As software becomes increasingly important to all aspects of industry, there is a need to encourage practitioners to adopt best practice so as to improve the quality of the processes in use, and therefore achieve targets relating to time, budget and quality.  The software development industry in Australia is dominated by a myriad of small firms.  This presents a challenge in terms of determining the current practices of industry participants, and in devising improvement initiatives which are feasible for small organisations.  Currently, the level of adoption of best practice among local software developers is unknown.  To help improve the software industry, it is necessary to determine the current status of use of practices and techniques.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of assessment-based software process improvement for small organisations needs to be evaluated.  The objective of this research is to understand the extent of software development practices currently in use, and to evaluate the effectiveness of assessment-based software process improvement initiatives for small firms. To achieve this objective, an extensive mail survey of the Queensland software industry was conducted to identify and compare best practice in software development with current practice.  The survey was based on the software best practice questionnaire used by the European Software Institute.  Following on from this, a detailed evaluation of a process improvement program in 22 small firms was carried out.  The program used the Rapid Assessments for Process Improvement for software Development (RAPID) model and method.  RAPID is based on ISO/IEC 15504 (SPICE) and includes eight processes: requirements elicitation, software development, configuration management, quality assurance, project management, problem resolution, risk management, and process establishment.  The evaluation analysed the process capability of the firms as reported from one-day software process assessments and also the extent of improvement as recorded at follow-up meetings held 7 to 16 months after the assessment.  Both quantitative and qualitative techniques were used to analyse the assessment reports. The study confirmed that there is wide variation in the extent of adoption of software development best practice in terms of the individual practices, as well as the organisations.  While project management planning and customer involvement practices are widely adopted, the use of metrics for estimating and testing are barely used by the organisations that responded to the survey.  Overall, practices of a technical nature are more widely adopted compared to techniques related to support and management.  Organisations involved in developing commercial off-the-shelf software have higher adoption than firms which do not develop such systems, and adoption of best practice is associated with the size of the development group.  The leaders in adoption have significantly better practices when compared to the laggards for 40 of the 44 practices included in the survey.  Furthermore, organisations from the finance, insurance and utilities sectors exhibited higher adoption of best practice compared to organisations from other sectors.  The overall adoption of 48 percent implies that the organisations which responded have adopted, on average, almost half of the best practices in the questionnaire.  While this overall adoption rate places the Queensland software industry in a competitive position compared to adoption of firms in European countries, there is scope for improvement. The process improvement assessments of 22 firms also confirmed that the capability of technical processes is higher than that of management processes; and suggested that higher capability is associated with the proportion of experienced staff and the proportion of staff with post graduate qualifications.  Higher process capability is also associated with firms undertaking projects of lengthy durations.  Most of the processes were rated at the lowest levels. Almost one third of all the processes were rated as incomplete (level 0) and 46 percent were rated as performed (level 1). The evaluation of the process improvement program was conducted by analysing the 22 assessment reports, and the 20 final reports from the follow-up meetings.  The extent of improvement is associated with the proportion of technical staff and the proportion of formally qualified staff.  The evaluation revealed that assessment-based process improvement programs are effective for small firms, regardless of the maturity of the processes at the time of the assessment.  As well as detailing the process capability of 22 small software firms, this study provides an interesting insight into the actions, reasons for inaction, and reactions of the firms as far as implementing the recommendations from the assessments.  Analysis of the reactions of the participants of this program suggests that for small firms, mentoring, training and organisation stability are important factors, while senior management support may not be an issue of concern. The study indicates that small firms can benefit from a low cost process improvement program with a restricted scope, a short time frame to evaluation, and mentoring from external assessors/consultants.  It is also crucial that the firm is not disrupted by internal or external events during the course of the software process improvement program.  Furthermore, this study provides a contribution to assessment methods by validating the RAPID model and method, and providing recommendations to improve the RAPID method.  The outcomes from this research have the potential to better equip practitioners and consultants to undertake software process improvement, hence increasing the success of small software development firms in domestic and global markets.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software evaluation</field><field name="subject">software development practice</field><field name="subject">software development firms</field><field name="subject">Queensland software industry.</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060110.180345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of Sources of PM2.5 and PM10 Aerosols in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Chan, Yiu-chung</field><field name="description">Urban health problems and visibility degradation problems are associated with particulate matter in the air, especially PM10 and PM25 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 j.tm and 2.5 jsm, respectively). The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics and sources of PM25 and PM20 aerosols in Brisbane. This study collected aerosol samples over a period of two and a half years at five sites around Brisbane. Source samples of soil dusts, road-side dusts and sea salt were also collected and analysed to provide information on source emission composition. The aerosol samples were analysed by a wide range of techniques, including Ion Beam Analysis and Scanning Electron Microscopy, for their chemical composition and particle size distribution. Some methodologies have been specifically developed in this study. The results presented here show that the chemical composition of PM20 aerosols in Brisbane varies largely with particle size and locations. The chemical composition of the samples are generally related to the land use near the monitoring sites. On average, the major components in the PM10 aerosol samples at five sites in Brisbane were identified as: crustal matter (27% by mass), organic matter (16%), sea salt (12%), soot (11%), and ammonium sulphate (7%). Among the Australian studies, in general, the results show that the composition of the PM25 aerosol samples collected at the Griffith University site (Brisbane) is closest to those of the New South Wales samples. The samples from Melbourne and Perth are generally richer in industry-and vehicle-related species. The major components of the PM25 aerosols at the GU site were identified as: organic matter (27% by mass), elemental carbon (23%), ammonium sulphate (14%), sea salt (9%) and crustal matter (6%). The results show that contribution of emission sources also has large particle size, temporal and spatial variations. Based on the results of source apportionment from the chemical mass balance method, the major contributors of PM20 aerosol mass in samples collected at five sites in Brisbane were found to include: soiL/road-side dusts (25% by mass, results of analysis also indicate a higher contribution from road-side dusts than from soil dusts), motor vehicle exhausts (13%, more than 80% of which are from diesel trucks/buses), elemental carbon and secondary products (around 15%), sea salt (12%), Ca/Ti-rich compounds from cement plant and mineral processing industries (11%), and biomass burning and bioaerosols (7%). On average, the PM25 aerosol mass at the Griffith University (GU) site was found to have contributions mainly from sources related to combustion. These sources include elemental carbon (24% by mass), secondary organics (21%), biomass burning (15%) and secondary sulphate (14%). Although motor vehicle exhausts contribute directly to only 6% of the PM25 aerosol mass at the GU site, their actual contribution could be substantial because most of the elemental carbon and secondary products are related to motor vehcile exhausts. On average, the results show that the visibility degradation problems in Brisbane are worse in winter/autumn than in summer. Soot and sulphate particles are the main visibility degrading species. In terms of visibility degrading sources, the main contributors are (excluding the contribution of NO2 gas): motor vehicles (up to 50%, including the secondary products), secondary sulphates (17%) and biomass burning (10%). In general, emission sources which contribute more to the fine particle fraction, and to gaseous pollutants, are most responsible for the aerosol associated health problems and visibility degradation problems. In Brisbane, these sources include motor vehicle exhausts, soil dusts, biomass burning and industrial dust.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Particulate matter in air</field><field name="subject">aerosols</field><field name="subject">air pollution</field><field name="subject">Brisbane (Qld.)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050906.093804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-Regulation and Wisdom in Relationship Satisfaction</field><field name="creator">Charker, Jillian H</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a program of research which aimed to explore the role of relationship self-regulation (or relationship "effort") and wisdom in relationship satisfaction.  Three separate studies were conducted to examine the association between self-regulation and satisfaction, and the mechanisms for this association.  Study 1 examined self-regulation, wisdom and satisfaction, using a sample of 61 couples in long-term relationships, and found that while wisdom shared little association with satisfaction, self-regulation was a significant correlate of satisfaction for men and women.  Study 2 examined whether the association between self-regulation and satisfaction was mediated by communication skills in a sample of 101 couples in the early stages of their relationship.  Results replicated the self-regulation/satisfaction association found in Study 1, but provided no evidence for mediation by communication.  Study 3 tested for mediation of the self-regulation/satisfaction association by attributions in a sample of 73 newly-wed couples.  The association between self-regulation and satisfaction was partially mediated by attributions, but self-regulation also had a direct relationship with satisfaction.  It was concluded that self-regulation is an important correlate of satisfaction in relationships, and that this association cannot be fully explained by communication or attributions.  Several directions for future research were provided, including the need to examine self-regulation and its predictors longitudinally, ways in which a behavioural measure of self-regulation could be developed, and the implications of self-regulation for couple therapy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">relationship self-regulation</field><field name="subject">relationship effort</field><field name="subject">relationship satisfaction</field><field name="subject">couples</field><field name="subject">couple relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030912.150523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lawyer Problem Solving: An Investigation of the Knowledge Used in Solving Practical Legal Problems</field><field name="creator">Chay, Allan James</field><field name="description">This study investigates the knowledge that legal practitioners use to solve authentic practical legal problems in naturalistic settings. The study examines the declarative and procedural knowledge that practitioners use in that context and whether experienced practitioners use knowledge organised in encapsulated and script form (Boshuizen &amp; Schmidt, 1992; Schmidt, Norman, &amp; Boshuizen, 1990) to enable &#145;expert&#146; performance. The purpose of the study is to provide an empirically-based understanding of the knowledge used in solving real-life practical legal problems, for the information of the providers of practical legal training in Australia and other common law countries. The providers of that training use assumptions about that knowledge and how it is acquired, which do not always rest on coherent theoretical or empirically-derived foundations. The study uses the lawyering literature to identify the knowledge such literature considers is required to solve practical legal problems in lawyer and client interview settings. The study also examines the assumptions about the nature of that knowledge, and how it is acquired, which are apparent in the approaches of the providers of practical legal training. The limitations of those assumptions are identified from a cognitive perspective.  The study examines cognitive conceptions of the knowledge used in problem solving in particular fields and how that knowledge becomes proceduralised and organised into structures called chunks and schemas. A particular examination is made of cognitive theories developed in the field of medical problem solving, which use the concepts of &#145;encapsulations&#146; and &#145;illness scripts&#146; to explain &#145;expert&#146; performance in diagnosing disease in clinical settings.  This analysis is used to synthesise the prediction that experienced legal practitioners may develop and use structures similar to encapsulations and illness scripts in problem solving.  This prediction is based on the similarities between the way medical practitioners and legal practitioners are educated and trained, and are taught to solve problems using a hypotheticodeductive method (or a domain variant in the case of law), and on the similarities between clinical settings and lawyer and client interview settings.  The study also examines theories that explain human problem solving by reference to a metaphorical &#145;problem space&#146;, and synthesises the prediction that practical legal problem solving can be explained by a problem space theory that was developed to accommodate complex, ill-defined problems. That theory uses the concepts of a problem zone to reflect the ill-defined nature of the problem as presented to the problem solver, a search and construction zone to reflect the phenomenon that the problem solver will have to construct operators to use to solve the problem, and a satisficing zone to reflect the phenomenon that there will be no single unambiguous solution to the problem (Middleton, 1998).  The study uses the lawyering literature to identify the characteristics of practical legal problems in a lawyer and client interview setting. The cognitive literature is used to identify the cognitive conceptions that correspond to those characteristics. It is argued that these problems are complex, ill-defined problems that have to be found by the problem solver using weak problem solving strategies such as problem decomposition, attribute identification and means-ends analysis (Simon, 1973; Dillon, 1982; Newell, 1980).  Based on these predictions two research questions are developed as follows: How do legal practitioners find and construct practical legal problems? Are there differences in the knowledge that experienced legal practitioners use and that which novice practitioners use? Do those differences reflect differences in the individual practitioner&#146;s underlying knowledge and how that knowledge is organised?  These questions are investigated in four case studies. Two of these studies involve experienced legal practitioners and two involve novices. These studies reveal that all the subjects used similar general problem solving strategies to find and construct problems. The subjects all constructed a series of problems rather than one large problem. The subjects did not all find and construct the same problems and some subjects&#146; constructions of problems changed as new information came to light. Most subjects did not finish the construction of problems at the interview. The processes that the subjects use to construct problems can be explained by Middleton&#146;s (1998) problem space model, although this study suggests that model needs to be modified to accommodate the on-going emergent character of practical legal problems as they occur in lawyer and client interview settings.  The investigation revealed qualitative differences between the problem attributes and moves that the experienced subjects identified and those that the novices identified. In summary, the experienced subjects identified attributes and moves that were more detailed, more directly related to the &#145;facts&#146; and more concrete than those that the novices identified. Both the experienced subjects and the novices appeared to rely on recognition (Newell &amp; Simon, 1972) to identify problem attributes and moves rather than on any apparent step-by-step legal analysis and reasoning process. This study suggests that the superior performance of the experienced subjects may be explained by their use of knowledge in encapsulated and script form, as predicted.  The study discusses the implications of its findings for practical legal training courses as a need to provide students with general problem solving knowledge, provide them with the knowledge that they will need to recognise problems in specific areas of practice, to help them start to develop knowledge in encapsulated and script form, and to develop an understanding of the limits of institutional training in developing professional expertise.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">legal practitioners</field><field name="subject">practical legal problems</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">common law</field><field name="subject">legal training</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070927.100346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamical Near Optimal Training for Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network (T2FNN) with Genetic Algorithm</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Martin Chun-Sheng</field><field name="description">Type-2 fuzzy logic system (FLS) cascaded with neural network, called type-2 fuzzy neural network (T2FNN), is presented in this paper to handle uncertainty with dynamical optimal learning. A T2FNN consists of type-2 fuzzy linguistic process as the antecedent part and the two-layer interval neural network as the consequent part. A general T2FNN is computational intensive due to the complexity of type 2 to type 1 reduction. Therefore the interval T2FNN is adopted in this paper to simplify the computational process. The dynamical optimal training algorithm for the two-layer consequent part of interval T2FNN is first developed. The stable and optimal left and right learning rates for the interval neural network, in the sense of maximum error reduction, can be derived for each iteration in the training process (back propagation). It can also be shown both learning rates can not be both negative. Further, due to variation of the initial MF parameters, i.e. the spread level of uncertain means or deviations of interval Gaussian MFs, the performance of back propagation training process may be affected. To achieve better total performance, a genetic algorithm (GA) is designed to search better-fit spread rate for uncertain means and near optimal learnings for the antecedent part. Several examples are fully illustrated. Excellent results are obtained for the truck backing-up control and the identification of nonlinear system, which yield more improved performance than those using type-1 FNN.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interval type-2 FNN</field><field name="subject">fuzzy neural networks</field><field name="subject">fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">dynamic optimal learning rate</field><field name="subject">back propagation</field><field name="subject">backpropagation</field><field name="subject">genetic algorithm</field><field name="subject">genetic algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030722.172812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silicon Carbide as the Nonvolatile-Dynamic-Memory Material</field><field name="creator">Cheong, Kuan Yew</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of three main parts, starting with the use of improved nitridation processes to grow acceptable quality gate oxides on silicon carbide (SiC)[1]&#150;[7], to the comprehensive investigation of basic electron-hole generation process in 4H SiC-based metal&#150;oxide&#150;semiconductor (MOS) capacitors [8], [9], and concluding with the experimental demonstration and analysis of nonvolatile characteristics of 4H SiC-based memory devices [10]&#150;[15]. In the first part of the thesis, two improved versions of nitridation techniques have been introduced to alleviate oxide-growth rate and toxicity problems. Using a combination of nitridation and oxidation processes, a sandwich technique (nitridation&#150;oxidation&#150;nitridation) has been proposed and verified to solve the lengthy and expensive oxide-growing process in direct nitric oxide (NO) gas [1]. The nitrogen source from the toxic-NO gas has been replaced by using a nontoxic nitrous oxide (N2O) gas. The best combination of process parameters in this gas is oxide-growing temperature at 1300oC with 10% N2O [2], [3]. The quality of nitrided gate oxides obtained by this technique is lower than the sandwich technique [6], [13]. Using 4H SiC-based MOS with nitrided gate oxides grown by either of the abovementioned nitridation techniques, the fundamentals of electron-hole generation have been investigated using high-temperature capacitance&#150;transient measurements. The contributions of carrier generation, occurring at room temperature, in the bulk and at the SiC&#150;SiO2 interface are evaluated and compared using a newly developed method [8], [9]. The effective bulk-generation rates are approximately equal for both types of nitrided oxides, whereas the effective surface-generation rates have been shown to exhibit very strong dependencies on the methods of producing the nitrided gate oxide. Based on analysis, the prevailing generation component in a SiC-based MOS capacitor with nitrided gate oxide is at SiC&#150;SiO2 interface located below the gate. Utilizing the understanding of electron-hole generation in SiC, the nonvolatile characteristics of memory device fabricated on SiC have been explored. The potential of developing a SiC-based one-transistor one-capacitor (1T/1C) nonvolatile-dynamic memory (NDM) has been analyzed using SiC-based MOS capacitors as storage elements or test structures. Three possible leakage mechanisms have been evaluated [10]&#150;[16]: (1) leakage via MOS capacitor dielectric, (2) leakage due to electron-hole generation in a depleted MOS capacitor, and (3) junction leakage due to generation current occurred at a reverse-biased pn junction surrounding the drain region of a select metal&#150;oxide&#150; semiconductor field&#150;effect&#150;transistor (MOSFET). Among them, leakage through capacitor oxide remains an important factor that could affect the nonvolatile property in the proposed device, whereas others leakage mechanisms are insignificant. Based on the overall results, the potential of developing a SiC-based 1T/1C NDM is encouraging.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silicon carbide</field><field name="subject">microelectronics</field><field name="subject">microelectronic engineering</field><field name="subject">MOSFET</field><field name="subject">MOSFETs</field><field name="subject">NDM</field><field name="subject">nitriding</field><field name="subject">nitridation</field><field name="subject">metal oxide semiconductors</field><field name="subject">metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050115.101233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bionomics of Culicoides molestus (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae): a pest biting midge in Gold Coast canal estates</field><field name="creator">Chitra, Eric</field><field name="description">Culicoides molestus (Skuse) is the major species of biting midge that plagues human comfort in the estuarine Gold Coast region of southeast Queensland. Local authorities have initiated a search for an effective, non-chemical means of control, that would minimize human-midge interaction. The effectiveness of a program to control an organism, such as a biting midge, is dependent upon knowledge of the biology of the particular organism of interest.  This project revolved examines the lifecycle of C. molestus in detail. It addresses questions regarding the location, seasonal distribution, and dispersal of its juvenile stages in the sand of infested beaches, and their response to chemical treatment, the monthly and annual cycles of the adult midge, and the possibilities of achieving laboratory oviposition, as a first step to laboratory colonisation.  The distribution of eggs, larvae and pupae of C. molestus was found to be mostly concentrated around, but below, mean tide level. They also occurred well below the mean tide level. Eggs and larvae have been recovered from as deep as 10 cm in the sand. A seasonal study of the juveniles of this species indicated that they were more strongly influenced by tides than seasons.  After a routine pest-control larviciding treatment, a beach recolonisation study revealed that beaches become suitable for oviposition approximately two months after treatment. Large larvae invaded the sprayed areas within days of treatment, which suggests the existence of a refuge outside of the reach of the insecticide. Larvae found in clean (egg- and larva-free), isolated sand containers, placed on the study beach, indicated that larvae could swim in or on the water as a way of moving around the beach. Extended bite-rate studies highlighted the existence of four peaks in adult midge biting activity during the course of a year, around the mid seasons. The strongest peaks of activity were found to be in autumn and spring, but the data suggest that the species undergoes four generations in a year.  Through a series of trial-and-error experiments, oviposition under laboratory conditions was achieved. Although the time from blood-feeding to egg maturation is not yet well determined, it occurs within an eight day mean survival period. Blood quality appears critical for adult blood-fed midge survival. Midges fed on the blood of a volunteer who was frequently exposed to midge bites do not live long enough to mature its eggs. The partial ovarial development of one unfed adult female, reared in the laboratory, indicates that C. molestus is facultatively anautogenous.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Culicoides molestus</field><field name="subject">biting midges</field><field name="subject">Ceratopogonidae</field><field name="subject">life-cycle</field><field name="subject">lifecycle</field><field name="subject">distribution</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">insect control</field><field name="subject">larviciding</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041119.101151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-Cultural Collaboration Between Parents and Professionals in Special Education: a Sociocultural and Ethnomethological Investigation</field><field name="creator">Choo, Lay Hiok</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the issue of parent participation and cultural diversity in the Australian special education context. Previous research in the U.S. had suggested that the low participation by parents of culturally diverse backgrounds was due to cultural barriers that hindered their partnership with professionals. In reviewing and critiquing this previous research, it became clear that the key concepts of collaboration, disability and culture required reconceptualisation. The theoretical tools deployed in this reconceptualisation are drawn from sociocultural theory and ethnomethodology. Seventeen parents of Chinese and Vietnamese backgrounds and 20 professionals were interviewed regarding the provision of special education for children attending either a special school or special education unit. Follow-up interviews were carried out to probe specific issues related to the salience of culture in parent-professional communication, their understanding of disability, and barriers to parent participation. In addition, the communication books that were passed between parents and professionals on a regular basis were obtained for 7 of the children. These books provide a unique insight into the way parents and professionals accomplished the category of Child-with-a-disability during their entries regarding the mundane practicalities of school and home. In suspending judgment about parent-professional collaboration, this thesis adopts the multiple foci of sociocultural analysis to gain a critical understanding of parent-professional relationships through time and across personal, interpersonal, community and institutional settings. Within this framework, this thesis found that parents and professionals prefer and enact a 'communicating' type of parent participation. Their preferences seemed to depend on a range of circumstances such as their work commitments, financial resources, language resources and changing educational goals for the child. The approach taken in the thesis also affords the specification of diverse models of collaboration (e.g. obliging/directing, influencing/complying, respectful distancing, coordinating, collaborating), each of which may be regarded as worthwhile and acceptable in specific local circumstances. This study found that overall the parent-professional relationship was a trust-given one in which participants unproblematically regarded the professionals as experts. The professionals' reports revealed them to be doing accounting work - creating a moral view of the good parent and good professional. The emphasis on context in both sociocultural and ethnomethodological approaches reframes parental and professional discourse about disability as being context-driven. In employing Membership Categorisation Analysis (MCA) to examine parents' and professionals' descriptions of the child in the communication book and the research interviews, positive as well as negative attributes of the child were obtained. Interpreting the findings in terms of the context of home and school reveals how negative attributes of the child became foregrounded. For example, the orientation to the child as lacking capacity to remember was an outcome of parents and professionals orienting to their (institutional) roles and responsibilities to manage the practicalities of school. The comparison of views reveals strong agreement between the parents and professionals about the child. Interpreting the data based on the task-at-hand of particular data collection settings provides one explanation. For instance, the communication book is a site where parents and professionals align with each other to co-construct a version of the child. Culture is not treated as a static set of traits and behavioural norms that accounts for the communication difficulties between Western-trained professionals and culturally-diverse parents. Rather, culture is theorised in this thesis as an evolving set of semiotic resources and repertoires of practice that participants draw upon and enact in their everyday activities. Using MCA, the ways in which participants deployed cultural categories, the social ends achieved by such deployment, and the attributes they assigned to these cultural categories, are documented. This approach takes cultural difference to be a resource that people use to account for conflicts, rather than as a determining cause of conflict. The documentation of how participants legitimised their explanations to add credibility to their accounts captures their moment-by-moment cultural categorisation work. In comparison to prior research, the significance of this approach is that it looks seriously at the parents' and professionals' mundane and enacted notions of collaboration and participation, the child with a disability, and culture. This thesis has interwoven several data sources and applied complementary analytics in order to reveal and understand some of the everyday complexity of cross-cultural parent professional interaction in the special education context. There is reason to look carefully at the daily achievements of the participants for it is where the intricacies of a phenomenon lie.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Special education</field><field name="subject">cultural diversity</field><field name="subject">Australian background</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese background</field><field name="subject">Chinese background</field><field name="subject">sociocultural investigation</field><field name="subject">ethnomethodological investigation</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural collaboration</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051114.154210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Trilateral Model for the Management of Corporate Image: an examination of the inter-relationship between an organisation's Self Image, its Projected Image and its Perceived Image</field><field name="creator">Christie, David John</field><field name="description">The Research Topic and the Need for It: This thesis starts with a review of what the literature says about the importance of corporate image and how it needs to be managed as a strategic asset.   However, the problem is there is no model that shows what corporate image comprises and explains how its various components interact with one another so that it can be managed.   The result is a number of confusing and contradictory definitions and unproductive discussions about things like whether corporate reputation and corporate image are different or synonymous.   In response to this need, it is suggested that corporate image comprises three different image perspectives; namely, Self Image, Projected Image and Perceived Image and that it is only when these are defined separately and regarded holistically that corporate image can be properly defined, understood and managed. Objective: The objective of this research was to develop and test this model using triangulated approaches in which data could be acquired and understood from different sources.   To this end questionnaires were developed by document analysis, consultation and discussion. This research was conducted in two very different organisations - a new university campus and a sugar co-operative.   In the interests of confidentiality they have been renamed Barton University's Kingsley Campus and Sunstate Sugar Co-operative Association Limited.   Data was input into both SPSS and HIPSYS computer programs for the Kingsley Campus research and into HIPSYS for the Sunstate Sugar research.   For both research sites the results were discussed with members of all response groups so that accurate interpretations of the data could be made and additional meaningful data acquired. For Kingsley Campus, response groups included all Academic and General Staff of Kingsley Campus for the Self Image and the Projected Image, and for the Perceived Image all Current and Past Students, a representative sample of Grade 12 high school students, advanced diploma students of Kingsley TAFE, and Community Leaders.   In all 3,693 questionnaires were distributed and 934 completed questionnaires were processed. For Sunstate Sugar, response groups included all employees for the Self Image separated by Management, Supervisors and Workforce, all Board members and all Employees who interface with the growers (members of the co-operative) for the Projected Image, and all members of the co-operative for the Perceived Image.   In all 1830 questionnaires were distributed and 916 completed questionnaires were processed. Findings: The results from the Kingsley Campus research showed that the Projected Image needed to be more effectively targeted at the Grade 12 target group.   The results from the Sunstate Sugar research showed that its Perceived Image was affected by its Self Image as well as by its Projected Image and that its Self Image in particular needed to be made more positive.   The results from both organisations suggest that a positive corporate Self Image influences the Projected Image and can have as much impact on the Perceived Image as does the Projected Image. In exploring and discussing the results of this research, each organization derived recommendations which led to their developing action plans for the more effective management of their corporate image. These results indicate that the model created has eliminated a gap in the literature, diffused the confusion regarding what corporate image is, and provided a structure and a methodology by which corporate image can be identified and managed.   It has been shown to have considerable utility.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate image</field><field name="subject">self image</field><field name="subject">projected image</field><field name="subject">perceived image</field><field name="subject">corporate identity</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030102.095828</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In The Eye Of Power: China And Xinjiang From The Qing Conquest To The 'New Great Game' For Central Asia, 1759-2004</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Michael Edmund</field><field name="description">The Qing conquest of 'Xinjiang' ('New Dominion' or 'New Territory') in 1759 proved to be a watershed development in the complex and often ambiguous relation between China and the amorphous Xiyu or 'Western Regions' that had lay 'beyond the pale' of Han Chinese civilisation since the Han (206 BCE-220 CE) and Tang (618-907) dynasties. The Qing destruction of the Mongol Zunghar state in the process of conquering 'Xinjiang' brought to a close the era of the dominance of the steppe nomadic-pastoralist world of Inner Asia over sedentary and agricultural China that had existed since at least 300 BCE with the expansion of the Xiongnu. Immediately following the conquest, as chapter two shall demonstrate, the over-arching goal of Qing rule in the region was to segregate Xinjiang from the Chinese regions of the empire. Yet, at the beginning of the 21st century the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) maintains that the 'Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region' (XUAR) is, and has been throughout recorded history, an 'integral' province of China. This thesis is thus focused on the evolution of the Chinese state's perception of Xinjiang as a dependent appendage in the late 18th century to that of an 'integral' province at the beginning of the 21st century. As such there are two key questions that are the focus of the thesis. First, how - by what processes, means and strategies - did Xinjiang arrive at its contemporary position as a province of the PRC? Second, how has this process impacted on China's 'foreign policy' along its western continental frontiers since the Qing conquest? The thesis is therefore not simply focused upon a discrete period or aspect of the historical development of China's interactions with Xinjiang, but rather an encompassing exploration of the processes that have resulted in China's contemporary dominance in the region. Two encompassing and related themes flow from these questions regarding the Chinese state's response to the dilemmas posed by the rule of Xinjiang. The first stems from the recognition that the present government of China's claims to the 'Chinese-ness' of Xinjiang are more than simply a statement of fact or an attempted legitimisation of current political realities. The statement that Xinjiang is an 'integral' province of the PRC, although indeed a statement of contemporary political reality, is also a profound statement of intent by the Chinese state. It is in fact one manifestation of an over-arching theme of integration and assimilation within the state's perceptions of Xinjiang across the 1759-2004 period. The second theme stems from the question as to how the processes associated with the first theme of integration and assimilation impacted upon the Chinese state's conception of its relation to those regions beyond its orbit. Xinjiang throughout most of Chinese history has been perceived as a 'frontier' region from which non-Chinese influences have entered and at times threatened the North China plain 'heartland' of Han civilisation. This is essentially a theme of confrontation between or opposition of 'external' to Chinese influences. The relationship between these two themes across the 1759-2004 period has been one of 'permanent provocation' whereby their interaction has produced mutual continuity and contestation. The Chinese state's goal of integration, and the concrete strategies and techniques employed in Xinjiang to attain it, have required the continued operation and vitality of opposing tendencies and dynamics. This process has provided (and continues to provide) both impetus and legitimation, in the perception of the state, for the exercise of state power in Xinjiang. Yet, as will become evident in the proceeding chapters, this interaction has not developed along a constant trajectory. Rather, the process has been characterised by fluctuations in the state's commitment to the goal of integration and in its ability to implement appropriate strategies with which to achieve integration. The thesis will thus argue that from the early 19th century onward the goal of integration became embedded in the state's perception of the 'correct' relation between itself and Xinjiang. Moreover, across the 1759-2004 period the notion of integration has evolved to become both the end and means of state action in Xinjiang.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Xinjiang</field><field name="subject">Han civilisation</field><field name="subject">Chinese history 1759-2004</field><field name="subject">Qing conquest</field><field name="subject">Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061121.163131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life Lines to Life Stories: Some Publications About Women in Nineteenth-Century Australia</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Patricia</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of an introduction and six of my books, published between 1985 and 1999, on aspects of the history of women in nineteenth-century Australia. The books are The Governesses: Letters from the Colonies 1862-1882 (1985); A Colonial Woman: The Life and Times of Mary Braidwood Mowle 1827-1857 (1986); Pen Portraits: Women Writers and Journalists in Nineteenth Century Australia (1988); Pioneer Writer: The Life of Louisa Atkinson, Novelist, Journalist, Naturalist (1990); Tasma: The Life of Jessie Couvreur (1994); and Rosa! Rosa! A Life of Rosa Praed, Novelist and Spiritualist (1999). At the time they were published each of these books either dealt with a new subject or presented a new approach to a subject. Collectively they represent a body of work that has expanded knowledge of women's lives and writing in nineteenth-century Australia. Although not consciously planned as a sequence at the outset, these books developed as a result of the influence on my thinking of the themes that emerged in Australian social and cultural historical writing during this period. The books also represent a development in my own work from the earlier more documentary-based books on letters and diaries to the interpretive challenge of biographical writing and the weaving of private lives with public achievements. These books make up a cohesive, cumulative body of work. Individually and as a whole, they make an original contribution to knowledge of the lives and achievements of women in nineteenth-century Australia. They received critical praise at the time of publication and have led to renewed interest and further research on the subjects they cover. My own knowledge and expertise has developed as a result of researching and writing them.  The Governesses was not only the first full-length study of a particular group of letters but it also documented aspects of the lives of governesses in Australia, a little researched subject to that time. A Colonial Woman, based on a previously unpublished and virtually unknown diary, pointed to the importance of 'ordinary' lives in presenting an enriched view of the past.  Pen Portraits documented the early history of women journalists in Australia, a previously neglected subject. Three of the women I included in Pen Portraits, Louisa Atkinson, Tasma and Rosa Praed, the first two of whom were pioneer women journalists as well as novelists, became the subjects of my full-length biographies.  In my biographies of women writers, Pioneer Writer, Tasma, and Rosa! Rosa!, I recorded and interpreted the lives of these important writers placing them in the context of Australian cultural history as women who negotiated gender barriers and recorded this world in their fiction. My books on Louisa Atkinson and Tasma were the first full-length biographies of these significant but largely forgotten nineteenth-century women writers, while my biography of Rosa Praed was the first for more than fifty years. Each introduced original research that changed perceptions of the women's lives and consequently of attitudes to their creative work. Each provided information essential for further research on their historical significance and literary achievements.  Each involved extensive research that led to informed interpretation allowing insightful surmises essential to quality biography.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="subject">nineteenth century</field><field name="subject">1800s</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">women's studies</field><field name="subject">women writers</field><field name="subject">women authors</field><field name="subject">women journalists</field><field name="subject">female</field><field name="subject">literary</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">biography</field><field name="subject">biographies</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">critical</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">publication</field><field name="subject">publications</field><field name="subject">writing</field><field name="subject">Rosa Praed</field><field name="subject">Louisa Atkinson</field><field name="subject">Tasma</field><field name="subject">Jessie Couvreur</field><field name="subject">Mary Braidwood Mowle</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040719.150756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental Gift Giving Behaviour at Christmas: An Exploratory Study</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Peter</field><field name="description">Christmas is generally described as cultural, ritual and sociological phenomena of devotion, community and consumption.  The topic of this dissertation concerns a specific stream of research within the general domain of consumer behaviour.  The focal objective of this study is to develop a model and generate theory about parental gift giving behaviour at Christmas.   My study is unique because it attempts to model parental gift giving at Christmas in a consumer behaviour context.  Consumer behaviour theory suggests that parents seek information about possible gifts, set selection criteria for gift purchase, evaluate alternatives and buy the gifts for their children.  Following this broad view of theory, parents respond to children's request behaviour, evaluate the suitability of any requests and purchase the approved or appropriate items as Christmas gifts.  Children are encouraged to request any gifts that they desire, and these gift requests are often for specific brands.   In general Christmas gifts are selected from children's products and brands and there is extensive debate and research relating to television advertising and children's request behaviour at Christmas.  However, parents are not exposed to the same sources of advertising as their children and there is little evidence of research into the very important topics concerning motives, strategies, evaluations and the giving of brands that characterize parents' Christmas gift giving to their children.   The significance of this dissertation resides in the development and presentation of a comprehensive model for the conceptualisation of parental gift giving at Christmas, based on antecedents to parents' social roles of gift giving and direct and indirect behavioural outcomes of those gift giving roles.  Measures for each of these outcomes are developed and gender effects are also explored.   The sample frame was described as a parent with at least one child between the ages of 3-8 years and a survey package was delivered to parents of children from participating schools and kindergartens.  There were 2560 surveys distributed, with 450 individual responses representing a return rate of 17.6%.  The 450 cases available for analysis were factor analysed and formed into composite and latent variables to facilitate statistical analysis via Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, which is an appropriate procedure when the relationships are unknown or theoretical.   The results of the research have two distinct streams.  The first stream relates to the creation and validation of measurement constructs for the concept of Christmas spirit, parental gift giving, request communication, brand benefits and use of information sources, as well as involvement in giving gifts and involvement in giving brands as gifts.  The second stream relates to the relationships between variables; the results support the relationships antecedent to the parents' social roles of gift giving.  There is a significant relationship of Christmas spirit with involvement in giving gifts and with parental gift giving roles.  A significant relationship also exists between involvement in giving gifts and parental gift giving roles.  However, there is limited support for propositions related to outcomes of parental gift giving roles where there are significant relations between these roles and Christmas request communication, brand benefits and information sources. There is also a significant, indirect relationship between brand benefits and involvement in giving brands as gifts.   As part of the second stream, gender differences were examined; the results show that mothers' Christmas spirit has no effect on their gift giving roles and gift giving roles have no significant effect on request communication and information source usage.  On the other hand, the results show that the fathers' gift giving activities reflect the relationships outlined in the parental model.   The study has academic implications for sociology and consumer behaviour disciplines and commercial implications for manufacturers, advertisers, brand owners and retailers.  Further investigations will be necessary to incorporate other elements into the parental gift-giving model and to extend the theory toward a fuller understanding of the parental Christmas gift giving phenomena.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gift</field><field name="subject">gifts</field><field name="subject">giving</field><field name="subject">present</field><field name="subject">presents</field><field name="subject">Christmas</field><field name="subject">shopping</field><field name="subject">purchase</field><field name="subject">purchases</field><field name="subject">purchasing</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">consumer</field><field name="subject">consumers</field><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">parental</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040520.103119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Science and Colonial Culture: Scientific Interests and Institutions in Brisbane, 1859-1900</field><field name="creator">Clements, Helen Gail</field><field name="description">Historians have investigated for some time the nature and practice of colonial science. Some have seen it in terms of the spread of European influence and knowledge in an age of imperialism, others have studied it in particular local contexts. These studies identi&amp; an emphasis on practical science and natural history, and a degree of dependence on experts resident at the European centre. More recent work thaws attention to the exchange of information that occurred between various sites on the periphery. In this thesis I investigate the nature and practice of science in Brisbane in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Brisbane was a small, isolated town, an administrative centre in a colony dominated by its pastoral industry. The govermnent, partly because of regular budgetary crises and partly because it could not perceive any public benefit, was not interested in funding science. The two scientific institutions - the Philosophical Society, which became the Royal Society in 1883, and the Acclimatisation Society - are studied in order to demonstrate the ways in which men with scientific interests organised themselves and attempted to influence the scientific agenda. I go on to trace the relationships and communication networks of the two men who are arguably the pre-eminent figures in nineteenth-century Queensland science, F. M. Bailey and Joseph Bancroft, in an attempt to determine what effect geographic and intellectual isolation, and lack of funding, had on their activities. Several themes emerge. First, although there was an emphasis as elsewhere on practical science and natural history, for some middle class men science was a social and cultural pursuit. These men, in seeking to re-create the institutions that they had left behind them in Britain, established social and political networks that helped to establish them in a new society. The continual inflow of new immigrants guaranteed an inflow of scientific culture and new technology. Second, acclimatisation and economic botany provided a focus for practical scientific activities. Through the leadership of Lewis Bernays, a public servant with no scientific background or training, acclimatisation became a respectable activity in which people from all over the colony participated. Acclimatisation represented the interface between science, technology and economic progress. Third, other men such as F. M. Bailey, the colonial botanist, and Dr Joseph Bancroft, who had many scientific interests, were intent on both expanding the body of knowledge and making use of what they considered useful knowledge for the benefit of the colony. A simple diffusion model does not explain adequately the complex conditions under which western science was pursued and established in a remote settler society such as Queensland.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colonial science</field><field name="subject">Brisbane (Qld)</field><field name="subject">Queensland science</field><field name="subject">acclimatisation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050914.155807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sin1 and Sin1 Isoforms: An Investigation into the Biological Significance of a Novel Human Protein Family</field><field name="creator">Cloonan, Nicole</field><field name="description">Stress activated protein kinase (SAPK) interacting protein 1 (Sin1) is a member of a recently characterized gene family, conserved from yeast to humans. The gene copy number is strictly conserved (one Sin1 gene per genome), and the protein may be expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues. The Sin1 family has been implicated in several different signal transduction pathways. Originally identified as a partial cDNA and candidate Ras inhibitor, recent functional studies have revealed interactions with an interferon (IFN) receptor subunit (IFNAR2), and the SAPK JNK. Interactions have also been described between the yeast orthologues and the phosphatidylinositol kinase
TOR2. Collectively, these data suggest that Sin1 has an important cellular role, and this study has investigated possible functions for this protein.  As human Sin1 proteins have no paralogues within the genome, secondary structure homology was used to identify major domains within the protein. Four major domains within human Sin1 were deduced: an N-terminal domain containing a functional nuclear localization signal, a functional nuclear export signal, and a coiledcoil region; the conserved region in the middle that is likely to be a ubiquitin-like &#946;-grasp protein binding domain; a Ras binding domain; and a pleckstrin homology-like domain that targets Sin1 to the plasma membrane and lipid rafts in vivo. Full and partial length EGFP constructs were used to examine the localization of human Sin1, and several isoforms derived from alternative splicing. All isoforms localized to the nucleus and nucleolus. Beyond this, Sin1&#945; and Sin1&#978; had cytoplasmic staining, while Sin1 and Sin1&#946; were also found at the plasma membrane and lipid rafts. Both the N-terminal domain and the conserved region in the middle were found to contribute to nuclear localization.  Comparative genomic analysis between human, mouse, rat, dog, and chicken Sin1 genes revealed a number of conserved intronic regions, and the putative functions of these were predicted. Additionally, a putative promoter module within a CpG island and encompassing the transcription start site was predicted in all species. The human CpG island was found to have promoter activity in HEK293 cells. Using bioinformatics, genes that may be co-regulated with Sin1 were identified. These genes contained the Sin1 promoter module, and were found to co-express in large scale gene expression studies. Most of these genes were directly involved in the cellular response to pathogen infection, suggesting a conserved role for Sin1 in this pathway.  Key biochemical functions of the Sin1 proteins were also identified, including the ability of Sin1 proteins to form dimers, and the ability of over-expressed Sin1 to induce apoptosis (mediated through the conserved region in the middle). Additionally, endogenous Sin1 protein levels were found to change following serum deprivation and hypoosmotic stress. Together, these studies have provided significant insight into the cellular role of Sin1, suggesting a role in inducing apoptosis as part of the IFN response to viral infection. The biological significance of the Sin1 proteins is discussed in the context of their predicted functions and the evolution of the protein family.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sin1</field><field name="subject">Sin1 Isoforms</field><field name="subject">Novel Human Protein Family</field><field name="subject">protein kinase</field><field name="subject">SAPK</field><field name="subject">protein 1</field><field name="subject">mammalian tissues</field><field name="subject">gene family</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071102.150237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Feminist Understanding of Liturgical Art</field><field name="creator">Close, Jennifer M</field><field name="description">Among church folk in Australia today, there are concerns that soon ? with the surge of secularism in our society ? there will be no Christian tradition left for their children to inherit.  At the same time, there is also a rising desire for spiritual renewal among Australians.  It seems that the church and society are worlds apart.  It is my contention that feminist liturgical artists are in a unique position to bridge the gap between the church and the world, and to promote the spiritual renewal of both. My task in this thesis is to devise a feminist model of liturgical art practice which is both aesthetic and prophetic.  In this model, liturgical art is capable both of inspiring people to contemplate divine meanings and of calling the people to discipleship in the service of God in the world.  It is also able both to encourage hope and challenge injustices.  A balanced approach to the aesthetic and prophetic is suggested in Elisabeth Sch&#252;ssler Fiorenza's (1992) four-step model of feminist research, which shapes my project. The principles which form the framework of my feminist understanding of liturgical art are widely applicable, and do not just apply to women.  Even so, I maintain that women are more gifted than men at understanding the world in terms of relations rather than hierarchies.  In the Catholic church today, we need this sense of relation more than ever.  The church needs to be in creative relation with contemporary culture, or we are going to lose the young people from our ranks, and consequently our future.  Within the church, the hierarchy needs to be in creative relation with the laity, and this requires a more collaborative approach to leadership ? including ministry.  Within the liturgical environment, the church needs images which are able to draw heaven and earth into creative relation.  These inclusive and holistic ideas are basic to a feminist practice of liturgical art as I describe it in this project. To demonstrate what such a practice might look like, I use examples from my own liturgical artwork.  I aim to show how theory/theology and practice are inextricably interrelated in a feminist practice of liturgical art, and that practice precedes theory/theology, and that theory/theology leads to renewed practice.  This has certainly been my experience while writing this thesis. The model of feminist liturgical art practice, which I formulate in this thesis, is postmodern.  The largest theoretical challenge for me in this project was to come to terms with beauty theory, a conceptual framework which underpinned modernist art theory.  By training and by inclination, I am disinclined to favour an art theory in which the highest value is beauty.  Beauty theory was significantly deconstructed in the artworld in the 20th century and the new understandings of beauty arising today show the signs of paradigm shift. In the case of beauty theology, however, nothing comparable has caused theologians to significantly refigure their core value.   Coming to terms with beauty theology was my largest theological challenge.  My solution in both cases was to enlarge the category of beauty by adding ugliness.  I call this category 'beautiful ugliness' (Boyd 1960, 200).  However, 'beautiful ugliness' is not the focus of my aesthetic approach.  I use 'life' as the core value. Into the mix of feminist postmodern art theory/theology, I add some elements of classical American pragmatism.  In a pragmatic frame, ideas need to be tested out in the realities of everyday life.  In line with my chosen core value, I use the terms life-relevant and life-enhancing (Miles 1985, 6) as criteria for testing the value of liturgical art. This project represents my attempt to draw a picture of what a feminist, postmodern, pragmatic, aesthetic/prophetic practice of liturgical art might look like in 21st century Australia.  My hope is that there are other women and men artists, like myself, who work with 'passionate purpose' (Alexander 1933, 53) - driven by their faith in God; by their fidelity to the Christian tradition; by a desire to imaginatively explore, express and stretch the boundaries of that tradition; and by a powerful sense of place-connection and of community-belonging ? who will find this model useful and perhaps inspiring.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church and society</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="subject">spiritual renewal</field><field name="subject">feminist model</field><field name="subject">liturgical art</field><field name="subject">Christian tradition</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060301.141353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Influencing Ant Assemblages and Ant Community Composition in a Sub-Tropical Suburban Environment</field><field name="creator">Clough, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">The main objective of this study was to examine the abundance and diversity of ants in suburban sites following vegetation removal or modification for development. This research examines the capacity of suburban sites to support ant diversity, which is dependent on the site characteristics and their surrounding environment. The study focused on 29 suburban garden and 3 suburban reserve sites on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. This region, through continuing land development, undergoes ongoing habitat disturbance and modification.  Ground-dwelling ants were collected by pitfall trapping in study sites over three summers between 1997 and 1999. In total, 28,512 ants from 60 species in 31 genera were collected.  Garden sites that maintain vegetation structural diversity were found to be most similar to reserve sites in terms of ant community composition. These sites were highest in ant richness and diversity and contained particularly high proportions of specialized ant species. Sites in close proximity to remnants of native vegetation contained higher species diversity and a greater proportion of specialized ant species.  The introduced tramp ant, Pheidole megacephala was found in 28 of the 32 sites and was found to significantly reduce ant species richness and diversity and displace the dominant ant Iridomyrmex sp. 1 in suburban environments. This ant poses a serious threat to the recovery of a diverse ant fauna to suburban environments. Ant community composition was shown to vary significantly among suburban sites. The ant functional groups commonly found in disturbed sites were abundant in open sites with little canopy cover in this study. Sites that provided vegetation structural diversity and areas of closed canopy supported similar functional groups to natural vegetation remnants. These results indicate that ant communities in suburban environments respond to disturbance in a similar manner to ant communities in tropical forests and rainforests. The dominance by functional groups and presence of specialized species may therefore be used as an indicator of disturbance and the restoration of suitable habitat in suburban sites.  The presence of specialized species of ants in suburban garden sites and their clear preference for particular site characteristics indicate that these species utilize resources available in the suburban matrix. These results indicate that residential suburban sites are of value in the enhancement of ant diversity in fragmented landscapes and that they may provide supportive habitat to, and act as corridors between, vegetation fragments.  In order to preserve biodiversity within suburban environments, landowners should be advised to retain as much existing vegetation within a site as possible. Clearing should be limited to that necessary to allow construction of dwellings and for safety. In addition, landowners should be encouraged to establish or maintain structurally diverse vegetation layers within sites in order to provide diverse microenvironments for fauna habitat.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ant</field><field name="subject">ants</field><field name="subject">assemblage</field><field name="subject">assemblages</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="subject">suburbs</field><field name="subject">suburban</field><field name="subject">suburbia</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">vegetation removal</field><field name="subject">ecological disturbance</field><field name="subject">disturbances</field><field name="subject">Pheidole megacephala</field><field name="subject">Iridomyrmex</field><field name="subject">land clearing</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040719.141317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linking the Ecological and Economic Values of Wetlands: A Case Study of the Wetlands of Moreton Bay</field><field name="creator">Clouston, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship between the underlying ecological values of wetlands and the economic values they produce.

For example, the off-site, indirect benefits provided by wetlands have largely been ignored.  This has led to an undervaluation of these ecosystems. The integration of ecological and economic values requires incorporating differing types of information and systems of value derived from differing disciplines with differing paradigms.  To understand the differing disciplinary perspectives the thesis explores the ecological functions of wetlands and the economic goods and services that they provide.  The functions and benefits of wetlands are linked at the ecological-economic interface.  A consensus on the definition of ecological value could not be discerned within the discipline of ecology.  Thus, a definition and index of ecological value is developed to demonstrate the attributes of coastal and wetland systems that provide for instrumental human benefits.  These attributes include productivity, the ability to provide habitats for dependent species and the diversity of species and organisation they support.  However, ecological information is not presently available to operationalise the index.  The ability of economic techniques to capture this ecological value is then investigated. Three approaches for assessing non-market values (direct linkage models, revealed preference and stated preference models) are reviewed with respect to their ability to capture ecological value.  An alternative biophysical approach, namely energy analysis, is also considered.  The review suggests that it may be possible to measure ecological value using the contingent valuation method.  The role of information in preference formation and willingness to pay bids is then investigated along with a number of other issues that need to be resolved before using the contingent valuation method. The wetlands of the case study area, Moreton Bay, Australia exhibit both ecological and economic values.  The wetlands contribute approximately one-third of primary productivity in the Bay, provide habitat for a wide range of dependent species (including internationally recognised migratory wader birds) and have a diverse fauna with a relatively large number of endemic species.  Economic values of the wetlands include both direct and indirect use values (for example, fishing, recreation, water quality improvements and storm buffering) and non-use values.  Non-use values include the value in preserving the environment for future generations (bequest value) and the existence of vulnerable animals such as turtles and dugongs, which one may never expect to see.  If consumers are willing to pay to preserve these animals, this is also a valid economic value.  The economic technique of contingent valuation is tested to determine if it is possible to capture ecological value by providing respondents, selected by random sample, to a survey with the relevant information.  A case study is undertaken in Moreton Bay to determine respondents' willingness to pay to improve water quality and hence protect the wetlands.  To test the effects of differing types information, four different versions of the survey were sent to four groups of 500 respondents.  Case A provided no extra information so it could be used as a control.  Case B included information about the ecological values of the wetlands of Moreton Bay.  Case C provided information about the economic use values of the wetlands in the Bay including direct and indirect use.  Case D provided information about the non-use values of endangered species resident in the Bay that are dependent on the wetlands.  The results indicate that the provision of different types of information influences willingness to pay.  However, willingness to pay when provided with ecological information is not significantly different from willingness to pay when provided with other information. As it was not possible from the research undertaken to state that the contingent valuation method can capture ecological value, an alternative approach is proposed to link ecological and economic values.  It is argued that ecologists and economists need to develop common aims and scales of assessment.  Further, communication between the two disciplines can be enhanced through the use of agreed indicator terms.  Through an iterative approach it should then be possible to understand the linkages between changes in indicators of ecosystem values and indicators of economic value.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wetlands</field><field name="subject">wetland conservation</field><field name="subject">wetland protection</field><field name="subject">environmental economics</field><field name="subject">ecological economics</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030828.140330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Interaction of Industrial Tribunals and Workplace Industrial Relations in Australia: the Metal trades, 1900 to 1929</field><field name="creator">Cockfield, Sandra A</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the influence of compulsory state arbitration and wages board systems on workplace industrial relations. Using an historical and comparative case study approach, the thesis researches workplace industrial relations at three firms operating in the metal industry between 1900 and 1929. A political economy perspective is employed to examine the interaction of institutional stnictures and economic and political processes in the regulation of the wage-effort bargain at the workplace. Key concepts are drawn from both mainstream industrial relations theory, in particular the Oxford School approach, and labour process theory. Drawing on the work of flanders, a distinction is made between the economic and political aspects of the wage-effort bargain through the differentiation of market relations and managerial relations. This thesis argues that arbitral and wages board systems interacted with a range of factors to shape and influence workplace industrial relations. In keeping with the political economy perspective, the thesis examines the economic, industry, technological, political, and institutional environment within which the three cases operated, identifying changes and trends in these factors during the period under review and their implications for workplace industrial relations. The three cases allowed a closer examination of the influence of these general trends on the development of workplace industrial relations. The cases demonstrate the diversity of the metals sector, each representing a different industry in that sector. Further, the cases differed in their geographic and jurisdictional location, allowing comparisons between Victoria and New South Wales to be made. An examination of the role of arbitral tribunals and wages boards argues that the tribunals used their ability to regulate and stabilise market relations to offset their intervention in managerial relations. In this respect the tribunals sought to engineer changes in managerial relations favourable to industry development and yet simultaneously obtain support from the unions through improvements in market relations. As a consequence of these conflicting objectives the tribunals often behaved in a contradictory manner. In addition, unintended consequences often flowed from tribunal regulation and were important in shaping events at the workplace. Thus while industrial tribunals sought to improve market relations, they inadvertently assisted workers to gain more influence over managerial relations. In each case the workplace was the site of much regulatory activity, whether initiated by management, unions or workers. However, the three cases each present a different pattern of workplace industrial relations in terms: of scope of regulation at the workplace; the role of unions; the nature of managerial strategy; the role of unions; and the implementation and enforcement of tribunals decisions. Moreover, the effect of arbitration and wages board systems at each workplace varied, with the influence of a particular matrix of industry, economic, technological and institutional conditions shaped at the workplace.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Compulsory State arbitration</field><field name="subject">arbitral tribunals</field><field name="subject">wage boards</field><field name="subject">worplace industrial relations</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050914.170636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Application of in situ Digital Networks to News Reporting and Delivery</field><field name="creator">Cokley, John D</field><field name="description">The development of digital networks has allowed the largest news media organisations to consolidate and centralise their publishing businesses in flourishing capital-city markets. This has resulted in a withdrawal from other less-viable markets, especially those which are geographically remote, and the subsequent emergence of the 'digital divide' with its attendant negative effects. This thesis proposes that the combination of technologies, theories and processes which has brought about the 'digital divide' can now be realigned to reverse those negative effects, and to enhance the possibility of focussed participatory communication taking place within and between those previously less-viable markets. This enhanced participatory communication - which I have named 'integrated journalism' - brings with it measurable and positive effects, generally known as community capacity building effects, which lead to better outcomes for the members of enhanced communities, a more innovative and flourishing approach to life and business, and a more innovative and forward-looking atmosphere within enhanced communities. Two new models are devised and presented: the first allows members of audience communities to learn and implement the process of publishing a community newspaper under the tuition of an experienced journalist; the second enables both journalists and audience members to measure and direct the effects of news publication within communities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">News media</field><field name="subject">digital networks</field><field name="subject">digital divide</field><field name="subject">integrated journalism</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060731.174040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myth, Monolith or Normative Model? Evolution of the Career Service Model of Employment in the Queensland Public Service 1859-2000</field><field name="creator">Colley, Linda Katurah</field><field name="description">Public services play an essential role in society, and every citizen uses them.  They have traditionally been the principal means of implementing the political will, through policy development and implementation.  Yet it is almost a national sport to criticise public servants.  Their image is often poor, fed by television programmes such as Yes Minister.  Common perceptions include that they have little real merit, do not work hard, are under little pressure to perform, are too powerful, are almost impossible to dismiss, and could benefit from some private sector experience.  Such are the consequences of the career service model of employment that public servants enjoy. This thesis considers the much-maligned career service model of public sector employment relations, and asks how important it was, how it evolved, and why.  First, it outlines the traditional understanding of public service employment, with its central tenets of merit, tenure, standardised conditions and political neutrality, all administered by an independent central personnel agency, and then explores the adoption, adaptation and reform of that model in three major western democracies - Britain, the United States and Australia.  Then, it considers the implementation and evolution of that model in the Queensland public service from 1859 to 2000. The thesis argues that the traditional career service model was necessary to overcome problems of politicisation, corruption, insecurity and inefficiency that arose from the previous patronage model in the early 1800s.  The model contained sound principles that were largely consistent with Westminster conventions, and were considered necessary for effective service in a political environment.  Poor implementation of the model led to growing dissatisfaction by the late 20th century.  However, rather than diagnose the problem as poor implementation and perhaps inadequate political leadership of the service, the career service model itself was found deficient, and was subjected to extensive reform through the weakening of its central tenets.  The evolution of the career service demonstrates some circularity, as the problems of politicisation and insecurity that existed prior to the career service model begin to re-emerge.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">civil service</field><field name="subject">public service</field><field name="subject">civil servants</field><field name="subject">public servants</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">image</field><field name="subject">public opinion</field><field name="subject">politicisation</field><field name="subject">politicization</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050602.120554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music as Evocative Power: The Intersection of Music with Images of the Divine in the Songs of Hildegard of Bingen</field><field name="creator">Collingridge, Lorna Marie</field><field name="description">Hildegard's songs evoke an erotic and embodied devotion to a Divinity imagined as sensuous, relational, immanent and often female.  These songs, written for use in her predominantly female community, are part of Hildegard's educational program to guide the spiritual development of the women in her Benedictine monastery.  Hildegard's theology of music proposes that the physical act of singing enables humans to experience connection to the Living Light (Hildegard's most common address for the voice of the Holy Presence in her visions, lux vivens), and to embody this Divinity in their midst.  Her songs express, in dense poetic texts set to widely-ranging chant-like melodies, her rich imaging of the fecund presence of the Divine.  The singers are thus encouraged to imagine themselves in relationship with the Holy One, the Living Light, through the physical act of singing these evocative songs. This dissertation analyses four of Hildegard's songs, representing a small cross section of her musical oeuvre.  The analysis elucidates the way in which the music affectively conveys the meaning and significance of the texts.  Carefully incising the "flesh" from the structural "bones" of the melodies reveals underlying organising configurations which pervade the songs and deliver the texts in a distinctive manner.  Hildegard professed herself to be musically uneducated because she lacked a knowledge of music notation, although she admitted to extensive experience in singing Divine Office.  However, she clearly claims to be the oral composer of her songs, arranging late in her life for music scribes to notate her melodies.  My analysis unravels the influence of the oral composer as it intersects with the influence of the musically trained scribes who neumed her texts. Hildegard wrote that the "words symbolize the body, and the jubilant music indicates the spirit" (Scivias 3:12:13).  She claims that the music conveys the meaning of the texts with affective power, and my analysis shows ways in which the oral composer endeavors to achieve this goal.  Her texts, conveyed by her melodies and thus intimately entwined with the words they deliver, are powerfully persuasive forces in the spiritual education of the women in her monastery.  This dissertation uncovers significant insights which can inform the communal practice of worship of the Divine, especially where song forms part of that worship, and particularly in regard to the imagining of Divinity in ways which can nourish the diversity of all humans, all creatures, and all creation.  The work of feminist theologians is brought into dialogue with Hildegard's imagery and educational purpose, thus making available ways of imagining the Divine which are especially important for contemporary women, who have suffered from being excluded from the imago Dei.  Thus the dissertation unearths a rich lode of female, and creatural embodied images, which threads its way though the millennia, but now needs to be mined to uncover images that might work for contemporary Christians seeking multiple imaging of the Divine to touch the deep feminist, ecological and liberative yearnings of many hearts and spirits.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hildegard of Bingen</field><field name="subject">Saint Hildegard von Bingen</field><field name="subject">Hildegardis</field><field name="subject">religious songs</field><field name="subject">song</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">musical</field><field name="subject">spiritual</field><field name="subject">the Divine</field><field name="subject">Divinity</field><field name="subject">female</field><field name="subject">feminist</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">woman</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">Christian</field><field name="subject">Christians</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">worship</field><field name="subject">sacred vocal music</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040624.110229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Hormonal and Vascular Genes in Migraine</field><field name="creator">Colson, Natalie</field><field name="description">Migraine is a frequent debilitating neurological disorder that is considered to be genetically complex with a multifactorial mode of inheritance. It has a high prevalence with approximately 18% of women and 6% of men suffering from the disorder. Migraine is characterized by severe head pain with associated nausea, emesis, photophobia, phonophobia, and neurological disturbances. The International Headache Society (IHS) has classified various types of migraine according to their clinical features. The two main subtypes of migraine are migraine without aura (MO), occurring in ~70-75% of migraineurs, and migraine with aura (MA) which occurs in ~25% of migraineurs. Some people experience both types of attack in their lives. While the precise pathogenesis of migraine is unknown, it is widely accepted that short-term alterations in neuronal activity occur in relation to the attack, along with temporary changes in the cerebral vasculature. Trigeminal nerve activation is also considered pivotal to progression of a migraine attack. Neurotransmitters, especially serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), platelet activation and sympathetic hyperactivity all appear to play a part, whether as part of the primary triggering event, or as a response mechanism. Migraine imparts a significant burden on society, both socially and financially. The World Health Organization has identified migraine among the world's top 20 leading causes of disability, with an impact that extends far beyond individual suffering. There is significant evidence from family and twin studies to indicate a strong genetic component to migraine. The current understanding of migraine is that it is a polygenic multifactorial disorder. It has been postulated that genetic factors set the individual migraine threshold, with environmental influences playing a modulating role. It is likely that many genes may provide an important although moderate contribution to an individual&#146;s migraine susceptibility. The identification of migraine susceptibility genes has been the focus of substantial research to date and could eventually lead to improved treatments and greater understanding of the disorder. Several loci have shown promise, although these need to be followed up by both replication and functional studies to determine a definitive causative role. This research investigated the role of both hormonal and vascular related genes as candidate genes that may play a role in migraine susceptibility due to the well-known role of hormones and vascular changes in some migraineurs. The estrogen receptor (ESR) and progesterone receptor (PGR) genes are potential migraine candidates due to the recognized hormonal influence on migraine susceptibility. Migraines in women frequently occur during the childbearing years and are often influenced by significant hormonal milestones. The fluctuating hormone levels of the menstrual cycle have been implicated in migraine but a definitive role is yet to be established. It has been suggested that factors additional to circulating hormone levels may be at play. This research considered that variation in the ESR 1 and PGR genes may confer an increased migraine risk. To investigate the potential role of these genes in migraine, association studies investigating variants in ESR 1 and PGR were undertaken in two independent casecontrol cohorts. This was followed up by mutation screening and gene expression analysis in an effort to elucidate a functional role for these genes in the pathogenesis of migraine. Vascular genes also represent likely migraine candidates as alterations in both vascular function and cerebral blood flow are well known in migraine. Furthermore, cortical spreading depression (CSD), a depolarization wave that propagates across the brain cortex and has been speculated to cause the neurological symptoms that present in MA, has also been linked to vascular dysfunction. The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase (MTRR) genes both play a role in vascular functioning and were thus considered potential migraine candidates for this study. Both are involved in the pathway of homocysteine metabolism. Impaired activity of these enzymes can lead to mild hyperhomocysteinemia which is believed to lead to oxidative arterial damage. This may in turn impact on migraine susceptibility, possibly through the activation of trigeminal fibres. The MTHFR 677T allele results in an amino acid change in the catalytic domain of the enzyme leading to mild hyperhomocysteinemia. This particular variant has been implicated in migraine in four separate studies. One of these studies also suggested a role for the MTHFR 1298C allele in migraine. This allele also results in an amino acid change and reduced enzyme activity. Similarly, the MTRR 66G allele results in an amino acid change and has been associated with reduced activity of MTRR and increased plasma homocysteine concentration. To investigate the role of the ESR 1, PGR, MTHFR and MTRR genes in migraine, samples from two large independent case control cohorts were investigated. Cohort 1 was comprised of 275 migraineur samples and 275 age, sex and ethnicity matched controls while cohort 2 comprised 300 cases and 300 matched controls. All individuals were collected at the Genomics Research Centre with migraine diagnosis undertaken by HIS criteria and migraine affected individuals designated as MO or MA. Results of analysis of ESR 1 indicated a positive association with migraine in the two large independent cohorts for the exon 8 G594A polymorphism (P = 0.003; P = 8x10-6). Similarly, the PGR analysis showed a positive association with migraine for the PROGINS allele (P = 0.02; P = 0.003). Results also showed that individuals with both ESR 1 and PGR susceptibility alleles were 3.2 times more likely to suffer migraine those those with no susceptibility alleles. As the ESR 1 variant is synonymous, a mutation analysis was undertaken in a small sub-sample of individuals carrying the susceptibility allele, but no mutations were detected in these particular samples. Detailed mutation analysis of ESR 1 in a larger study group may be warranted. An ESR 1 and PGR expression analysis by RT-PCR was undertaken to examine if there were any notable expression level changes in migraineurs versus controls and additionally whether the susceptibility genotypes influenced gene expression. Altered expression levels may point to a functional change in the gene. Although results did not show any significant difference in expression levels in the case/control group, nor any influence in gene expression conferred by the specific susceptibility genotypes, ESR 1 expression did appear to be down-regulated in the migraine group and more specifically in the migraine susceptibility genotype subgroup. A larger study group may therefore be warranted to detect any potential genuine changes in gene expression. Overall, these results suggested that these hormonal genes appear to play a role in migraine susceptibility, although further studies are needed to define this. Results of the MTHFR 677 analysis showed that the TT genotype was significantly associated with the MA subgroup in a joint analysis of the two independent cohorts (P = 0.004). Results of analysis of MTHFR 1298, which is tightly linked to the 677 locus, showed a significant association in female migraineurs (P = 0.009). Similarly, results of the MTRR analysis also showed a significant difference between the female case and control groups with the G allele over-represented in female migraineurs (P = 0.022) These results may indicate that a significant gender effect appears in this locus as well as the MTHFR 1298 locus although results may also be due to a larger number of female migraineurs conferring increased statistical power to the gender subgroup. Interaction analysis of the MTHFR 1298 locus and the MTRR locus showed that females who carried both variants under a recessive model were 5 times more likely to suffer migraine those those with no susceptibility genotypes. Overall these results indicated that these vascular genes appear to play a role in migraine susceptibility. The final study focused on 6 genetic variants that had shown a positive association with migraine and/or MA in the same large association population analysed in this research. The aim of this study was to provide preliminary data on the potential role of genetic profiling in migraine. Using the genotypic data to create vascular and hormonal risk profiles based on positive association and interaction of MTHFR 677 T and ACE D alleles, and MTHFR 1298 AA and MTRR GG genotypes as vascular variants; and positive association and interaction of ESR 1 594 A and PGR PROGINS as hormonal variants, this study was able to demonstrate the relevance of genetic risk profiling to migraine. Results showed a significantly higher proportion of individuals with at least one genetic risk profile in the migraine group compared to those in the control group (P = 6 x 10-6). Individuals who possessed either the vascular and/or hormonal genetic risk profile were 8.6 times more likely to suffer from migraine than those who possessed a &#145;no risk&#146; profile. This indicated a greater effect than the individual effect of each of these variants. Furthermore individuals who possessed a vascular or both risk profiles were more likely to suffer nausea, emesis, phonophobia and photophobia, and have a mother who also suffered migraine. Overall, the genetic profiling approach provided interesting preliminary data on migraine susceptibility and indicated that such an approach may prove very useful for migraine diagnosis, particularly when all migraine genes have been identified. In conclusion this study provided the first indication that hormone receptor genes play a role in migraine susceptibility. Hormones have long been considered to play a role in the disorder but this study has provided the first molecular evidence to support this premise. In addition, this study showed that vascular related genes also play a role in migraine susceptibility. Finally, this study has clearly shown that migraine is a complex disorder involving multiple genes. Although a number of studies have implicated neurotransmitter related genes in the disorder, the present study is the first to show that both vascular and hormonal genes also play a role in migraine susceptibility. Thus there now appear to be three classes of genes that affect migraine susceptibility and although this study has implicated new variants, the preliminary genetic profiling study has shown that not all predisposing variants involved in the disorder have been defined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hormonal</field><field name="subject">Vascular</field><field name="subject">Genes</field><field name="subject">Migraine</field><field name="subject">Neurological Disorder</field><field name="subject">Headache</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071121.104112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Epibenthic and Planktonic Fauna in Subtropical Prawn Grow Out Ponds</field><field name="creator">Coman, Francis Edmund</field><field name="description">The assemblage composition, biomass and dynamics of zooplankton and epibenthos were examined in a commercial prawn pond in southeast Queensland over two seasons.  Physico-chemical characteristics of the pond water were measured concurrently. Numbers and biomass of zooplankton in the surface tows (140 micrometre mesh) varied from 8 ind. L-1 (44 micrograms L-1) to 112 ind. L-1 (324 micrograms L-1) in the first season, with peaks in biomass corresponding to peaks in numbers.  In the second season the zooplankton numbers varied from 12 to 590  ind. L-1, but peaks in numbers did not correspond with peaks in biomass, which varied from 28 to 465 micrograms L-1. This was due to differences in the size of the dominant taxa across the season.  Although this occurred in both seasons, the effect on biomass was more pronounced in the second season.  In both seasons, immediately after the ponds were stocked with prawn postlarvae there was a rapid decline in zooplankton numbers, particularly of the dominant larger copepods.  This was probably due to predation by the postlarvae.  Subsequent peaks in zooplankton numbers were principally due to barnacle nauplii. The largest peaks in zooplankton numbers occurred before stocking in the first season, but the largest peaks were in the middle of the second season.  While changes in abundance and biomass of the zooplankton assemblage were not correlated with physico-chemical characteristics in the first season, there were correlations between zooplankton numbers and temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and secchi disk readings in the second season.  No correlations were found with zooplankton biomass and physico-chemical characteristics in the second season.  The correlations in the second season were mainly due to the high prevalence of barnacle nauplii through the middle part of the season, and may reflect suitable conditions for barnacle reproduction. Epibenthic faunal abundance in the beam trawls (1 mm mesh) peaked at 14 ind. m-2 and 7 ind. m-2 in the first and second seasons respectively and the biomasses at 0.8 g m-2 and 0.7 g m-2.  Peaks in abundance of epibenthos did not correspond to peaks in biomass. This was due to large differences in the size of the taxa across the seasons.  Sergestids (Acetes sibogae) and amphipods were the most abundant taxa in beam trawl samples. Amphipods were only abundant in the first season, with their numbers increasing towards the end of the grow out period.  Acetes were abundant in both seasons, but were dominant in the second season.  Correlations between physico-chemical parameters and epibenthos numbers were found to be strongly influenced by the dominant taxa in each season.  In the first season, negative correlations were found between epibenthos abundance and pH and temperature.  These relationships may reflect an effect on the growth of macroalgae in the pond, with which the amphipods were strongly associated, rather than a direct effect on the epibenthos.  In the second season, a positive correlation existed between temperature and epibenthos abundance, however this was strongly influenced by the very high abundance of Acetes in the last sampling period.  No correlations were found between epibenthic fauna biomass and physico-chemical parameters.  Abundances of epibenthic fauna were not related to zooplankton densities indicating this source of food was not likely to be a limiting factor.    Neither the pond water exchange regime nor moon phase could explain changes observed in abundances of zooplankton or epibenthos assemblages in the first season, however the sampling regime was not designed to specifically investigate these effects.  In the second season water exchanges were sampled more rigorously.  The density of zooplankton in the outlet water was from 2 to 59% of the density of zooplankton in the pond, and the zooplankton density of the inlet water was from 9 to 50% of the outlet water.  The number of zooplankton recruited into the pond from the inlet water, after the prawns were stocked, was negligible and contributed little to changes observed in zooplankton assemblages. Reproduction of barnacles within the pond appeared to play the most important role in changes in the assemblage.  Water exchange did, however, appear to play a greater role in the changes observed in epibenthic fauna assemblages.  In the last season of sampling the feeding of the dominant epibenthic species, Acetes sibogae, was examined using a combination of gut content and stable isotope analysis.  Acetes gained little nutrition directly from the pelleted feed, probably relying primarily on zooplankton as their direct food source.  Other dietary items such as macroalgae also played a role in the nutrition of the Acetes.  If Acetes numbers were high at the beginning of a season they may compete with the newly stocked prawns for the zooplankton resource.  However, they will not compete with the prawns later in the season when the prawns are gaining most of their nutrition from the pelleted feed. Overall it appears that zooplankton are important to the nutrition of the prawns at the beginning of the season when the assemblage is usually dominated by copepods. Later in the season the assemblage is dominated by barnacle nauplii which are recruited from within the pond. The establishment of an abundant assemblage of suitable zooplankton species before stocking prawn postlarvae would appear to be beneficial, if not essential.  The assemblage of epibenthic fauna changes throughout the season as new recruits are brought in from outside the pond.  Epibenthic faunal assemblages in ponds from southeast Queensland are dominated by Acetes which are not likely to adversely affect the production of prawns unless they are particularly abundant early in the grow out season when the prawns would be utilising the same food resources as Acetes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plankton</field><field name="subject">zooplankton</field><field name="subject">epibenthos</field><field name="subject">epibenthic fauna</field><field name="subject">aquaculture</field><field name="subject">prawn farming</field><field name="subject">prawn farms</field><field name="subject">Acetes sibogae</field><field name="subject">segestids</field><field name="subject">amphipods</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030926.091736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Population Connectivity in Lotic Fauna: Constraints of Subdivision for Biotic Responses to Stream Habitat Restoration</field><field name="creator">Cook, Benjamin Douglas</field><field name="description">Connectivity in ecological systems is a broad concept that embodies the transmission of ecosystem components throughout landscapes at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Of relevance to the present study are the connections (or lack thereof) among local populations of stream fauna - population connectivity in lotic systems. Dispersal, recolonisation and migration are the demographic forms of population connectivity, and gene flow is the genetic aspect of population connectivity. Both forms of population connectivity have underpinned some of the classic theories and hypotheses in stream ecology, and have implications for pure and applied stream ecology, including ecosystem restoration. Conceptual models in ecology can facilitate understanding and predictability of the ecosystem processes they represent, and have potential applicability as management tools or 'rules of thumb' in conservation and restoration programs. Various theoretical models describe potential patterns of connectivity among local populations and in this thesis these models were used to evaluate population connectivity in a freshwater fish (southern pygmy perch, Nannoperca australis) and two reproductively isolated genetic lineages of freshwater shrimp (Paratya spp.) in small, geomorphically degraded streams in south eastern Australia. These streams (the Granite Creeks) have been the focus of a recent habitat restoration trial and several studies have examined fish and macroinvertebrate community responses to the experiment. It was the purpose of this study to contribute information about population connectivity in the selected species to complement these community ecology studies. Population connectivity was examined in these species using molecular data (mitochondrial and nuclear genetic data) and natural abundance isotopic signatures of nitrogen and carbon. At the landscape scale, results showed that populations of N. australis and the P. australiensis lineages were isolated among the streams and among sites within streams, and that there was no consistent pattern of isolation-by-distance in genetic data for any species. Thus, classic models of population connectivity, such as the Island Model and Stepping-Stone Model, were not supported by this study. Results indicated that population models that incorporated more complex aspects of stream structure may be more appropriate than these classic models for approximating observed patterns of population connectivity in lotic systems. The Stream Hierarchy Model (SHM) predicts that the hierarchical aspect of stream structure (i.e. stream confluences) have a dominant role in shaping patterns of population connectivity in lotic fauna, whereby populations among streams are more isolated than those within them. Although stream confluences were found to have an important role in population subdivision for the species examined in this study, the expectations of the SHM were met for only N. australis. For the P. australiensis lineages, the influence of topography (i.e. the longitudinal aspect of stream structure) was just as important as stream confluences in isolating local populations. Large-scale determinants of population isolation were thus found to be associated with both the hierarchical and longitudinal aspects of stream structure, and were not well represented by any single theoretical model of population connectivity. At within-stream scales, upland populations tended to be extremely isolated from other populations and had temporally stable genetic signatures. In contrast, lowland populations were connected to other lowland populations within the same stream to a greater degree, although the connections were patchy and a slight signature of temporal instability in the genetic data was evident for one of the P. australiensis lineages. Thus, metapopulation or patchy population models were found to represent connections among lowland populations within the same stream, although they were not appropriate for describing connectivity among upland populations. This finding highlights the importance of the longitudinal aspect of stream structure in shaping ecological patterns in lotic systems, and demonstrates that local patterns of population connectivity can vary over relatively small spatial scales. Overall, the results illustrate that both hierarchical and longitudinal aspects of stream structure can have important roles in isolating populations of stream fauna. They therefore also represent constraints for the ability of aquatic fauna to colonise restored habitat in streams. The corollary of this, however, is that such isolated populations of stream fauna represent appropriate population units at which to target habitat restoration. The hierarchical and longitudinal aspects of stream structure may thus represent 'rules of thumb' or 'landscape filters' that stream restoration ecologists could use to predict likely isolated populations of lotic fauna across the landscape. Such a 'rule of thumb' might be the inclusion of multiple isolated population units in restoration programs, as this strategy is likely to generate the greatest biological response to the restoration at the landscape scale, particularly with respect to intra-specific genetic diversity captured by restoration. At small spatial scales, such as for a single stream or tributary, the longitudinal aspect of stream structure can be an important factor to consider when designing stream habitat restoration programs. In this study, lowland sites were unstable and there were patchy connections among local lowland populations within the same stream, whereas upland populations were isolated at this scale. In contrast, other studies have found that upstream populations of some species can be connected in a patchy fashion in other systems. For such unstable sections of stream, where there are patchy patterns of local population connectivity, the inclusion of multiple restored patches, especially refugial habitat, is likely to produce the greatest biotic response at the patch scale, particularly with respect to demographic responses (such as local colonisation). Multiple restored refugial patches will enable species to persist throughout the stream section during adverse environmental conditions, will allow for variation in local movement patterns and distances between species and between years with contrasting environment conditions (e.g. stream flow), and may harbour different species assemblages and intraspecific genotypes due to stochastic processes (i.e. have functional heterogeneity). The hierarchical and longitudinal aspects of stream structure are thus important determinants of population connectivity at both large and small spatial scales, and have implications for how stream biota will respond to restoration at patch and landscape scales.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecological systems</field><field name="subject">stream fauna</field><field name="subject">lotic fauna</field><field name="subject">stream habitat restoration</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070718.115649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Management of Financial Resources: Post-Merger Structural Choice in a Blue Collar Union</field><field name="creator">Corrie, Joan</field><field name="description">Union mergers have occurred since unions were first established. Research on this particular aspect of the union movement is well established in the UK and the US. However, there are few studies of Australian union mergers, despite the fact that many Australian unions took part in a 'merger boom' in the 1980s and 1990s. Two of the few Australian studies, Hocking (1996) and Campling and Michelson (1998), utilised resource dependency and strategic choice theories to ascertain the why and how of union mergers. However, these Australian studies, like their UK and US counterparts, cease with the completion of the merger and, consequently, there is little known of the post-merger operation of unions. How does the integration of the merger partners - with their traditions, structures and financial arrangements - occur? This thesis rectifies the gap in the literature by means of a qualitative, longitudinal study of the merger and post-merger activities of one of the largest and most prominent unions in Australia, the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union (AMWU), as it moved towards complete amalgamation. The thesis examines the period 1995-2003. Four of the five pre-merger unions faced a serious and continued decline in membership and all faced mounting financial deficits. From 1995, the year the various mergers were completed, membership decline continued and financial resources dwindled further, providing the impetus for further and significant post-merger changes. The analysis demonstrates that, due to a continuing lack of financial resources, the AMWU leadership initiated a budgeting strategy which influenced the actions and changed the opinions of many of the Union's officials, guiding them towards accepting integration of the constituent divisions and near complete amalgamation. The thesis answers the questions of why and how a union moves from a negotiated federated structure towards amalgamation, post merger, with a particular focus on financial decision-making processes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blue collar unions</field><field name="subject">union mergers and amalgamations</field><field name="subject">Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union</field><field name="subject">workers' union structure</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070724.091823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Australian Man in Search of an Embodied Spirituality</field><field name="creator">Costigan, Philip John</field><field name="description">This thesis attempts to answer the question of how a framework for a contemporary Australian male spirituality might be formulated. It provides a theoretical base for constructing a spirituality for Australian men that would prove more relevant than the religious patriarchal framework that many men have traditionally experienced. The study makes use of the potentially positive impact on men's spirituality, and that of Australian men in particular, of three of the most significant revolutions affecting contemporary society - the feminist, environmental and embodiment movements. A critical examination is first made of the many strands of the contemporary Men's Movement and the spiritualities associated with them to gain an overall view of the state of men's spirituality today. From this overview, a new philosophical and religious stance is developed, spiritual virism. This may be defined as a sacred worldview by and for men, which, informed by feminist spiritual principles and perspectives, results in a range of redefined personal and collective spiritualities for men in relation to the Sacred. As a result, men are challenged to work actively for the deconstruction of religious patriarchy with a view to the liberation of both men and women. Spiritual virism, in turn, defines the methodology employed throughout the thesis. It is a critical analytical methodology drawn from the disciplines of academic spirituality and feminist theory. It entails the deconstruction of life-denying forms of patriarchal religious attitudes and the construction of more life-giving forms of spirituality. As experience is central in both spiritual and feminist research, personal texts, involving my own spiritual experience expressed in my paintings and in autobiographical commentaries on them, are the prime starting points in this analysis. Discursive discourse, involving more abstract methodology, follows. The deconstruction of the traditional patriarchal understanding of the Sacred in Western Christianity is undertaken first. The construction of more life-giving images of the Sacred, drawn from parallel paradigms in feminist thealogy and earth-based religion, follows. The results are that men may find a positive re-imaging of the Sacred in non-gendered forms such as the Source or the Great Cycle of Life, or in gendered forms such as the god, radically reinterpreted, and especially in the feminine Sacred, the Goddess. Evolving contemporary perceptions of the place of the environment in spirituality, such as ecofeminism, deep ecology, the new science and ecotheology, are employed to help construct more positive spiritual practices for men with respect to nature, the earth and the cosmos. This follows a deconstruction of traditional patriarchal understandings of them within society and Western Christianity. Insights such as the Sacred embodied in the unfolding cosmos, in the living earth and in the web of all life, lead men to a more contemplative, less exploitative attitude to the world around them. Thirdly, having deconstructed the traditional patriarchal attitude of Western Christianity to the male body, the positive impact of contemporary embodiment theory and practice on a spirituality for men is sought. Implications are drawn from feminist understandings of the sacrality of the female body, from Christian embodiment theology and from the practices of body-honouring religions. A more body/earth-centred spirituality, which is non-dualistic and respects the sacredness of the body and sexuality, emerges. A unified spiritual framework draws together and integrates the positive insights of each of these studies. In seeking the application of this generic male spirituality to the Australian context, this framework is brought into dialogue with contemporary approaches to Australian spirituality. The result is a way of formulating an Australian men's spirituality from the perspective of An Australian Man in Search of an Embodied Spirituality, the title of my thesis. This spirituality is rooted in the land of Australia, where the body of the Australian man is seen as sacred and embodied within the sacred body of the Australian land. A sacred Australian mythos is explored to personalise this embodiment. This images the masculine Sacred, the god, as embodied within the man, who both move within the all-encompassing female Sacred, the Goddess, embodied within the land of Australia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">embodied spirituality</field><field name="subject">Western Christianity</field><field name="subject">celibacy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070201.115833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calibration of Two Dimensional Saccadic Electro-Oculograms Using Artificial Neural Networks</field><field name="creator">Coughlin, Michael J.</field><field name="description">The electro-oculogram (EOG) is the most widely used technique for recording eye movements in clinical settings. It is inexpensive, practical, and non-invasive. Use of EOG is usually restricted to horizontal recordings as vertical EOG contains eyelid artefact (Oster &amp; Stern, 1980) and blinks. The ability to analyse two dimensional (2D) eye movements may provide additional diagnostic information on pathologies, and further insights into the nature of brain functioning. Simultaneous recording of both horizontal and vertical EOG also introduces other difficulties into calibration of the eye movements, such as different gains in the two signals, and misalignment of electrodes producing crosstalk. These transformations of the signals create problems in relating the two dimensional EOG to actual rotations of the eyes. The application of an artificial neural network (ANN) that could map 2D recordings into 2D eye positions would overcome this problem and improve the utility of EOG. To determine whether ANNs are capable of correctly calibrating the saccadic eye movement data from 2D EOG (i.e. performing the necessary inverse transformation), the ANNs were first tested on data generated from mathematical models of saccadic eye movements. Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with non-linear activation functions and trained with back propagation proved to be capable of calibrating simulated EOG data to a mean accuracy of 0.33&#176; of visual angle (SE = 0.01). Linear perceptrons (LPs) were only nearly half as accurate. For five subjects performing a saccadic eye movement task in the upper right quadrant of the visual field, the mean accuracy provided by the MLPs was 1.07&#176; of visual angle (SE = 0.01) for EOG data, and 0.95&#176; of visual angle (SE = 0.03) for infrared limbus reflection (IRIS&#174;) data. MLPs enabled calibration of 2D saccadic EOG to an accuracy not significantly different to that obtained with the infrared limbus tracking data.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electro-oculogram</field><field name="subject">electrooculogram</field><field name="subject">electro-oculograms</field><field name="subject">electrooculograms</field><field name="subject">electro-oculography</field><field name="subject">electrooculography</field><field name="subject">EOG</field><field name="subject">EOGs</field><field name="subject">artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">ANN</field><field name="subject">ANNs</field><field name="subject">eye movement</field><field name="subject">saccadic eye movements</field><field name="subject">saccades</field><field name="subject">multi-layer perceptrons</field><field name="subject">linear perceptrons</field><field name="subject">calibration</field><field name="subject">backpropagation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030409.110949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entropy Analysis of an Economic Activity: A Case Study of Simple Brickmaking in China</field><field name="creator">Coulter, John Edward</field><field name="description">1. There is a crisis in economics. The discipline evolved in nineteenth century Europe and is difficult to adapt to modern conditions, even in the West, and particularly in alien cultures. Application of conventional economic analysis to economic activity in a culture as alien as traditional China highlights the biases in assumptions of the paradigm. 2. The concepts, models and vocabulary evolved over one hundred years ago predate important developments in the natural sciences. It is now necessary for economists to concede no goods can ever be 'produced', and they are not 'consumed' either. In clear terms matter is transformed, but is not created or destroyed (First Law of Thermodynamics). 3. When people transform matter, in lay language we say energy is 'used'. In a simple cottage industry, 'raw material' is transformed into a commodity in front of our eyes by the use of human energy and the release of energy from a 'fuel'. In modem complex economic activity, it is difficult or impossible to keep track of the processes from raw matter to transformed 'product' although the principle is the same. 4. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that in any transformation, energy is not created or destroyed, but becomes 'less available'. In short, entropy increases. This appears to work well for pure physics and chemistry, but its application to analysis of economic activity has only been notional. 5.	There is a reason why economists borrowing terms from hard science experience difficulty. It is because physicists and chemists have addressed specific laboratory and engineering problems, but not the broader economic issues. The hypothesis gradually evolved in this research program that not only economic concepts and terms needed reworking, but those in physics as well. The definitions of energy as 'ability to do works and of entropy as 'unavailable energy' jar the logic of our commonsense. 6. The notion of 'available energy' was traced back to the phenomenon in physical chemistry known as exothermicity, or the release of energy during a chemical reaction. It was reasoned that while scientists had focussed on this phenomenon and measured it carefully they saw no need to ask where the energy came from, or to measure its transformation. From the perspective of analysing economic activity, the question was important. 7. It was hypothesised that the energy released from a fuel as electromagnetic radiation (mainly heat) was the residual of the set of coulombic forces within atoms that maintain the structure of shells of electrons around the protons. This idea in turn came from the presumption that molecular bonding is a residual of vectors of the set of coulombic forces within atoms, and the likelihood that in an exothermic reaction, after the reactants are said (by scientists) to 'seek equilibrium', product molecules have a portion of the coulombic forces 'left over' and not required to maintain their structures. An estimate was made of the coulombic forces extant in various fuels, and compared with the known data for their release of energy. 8. The idea was developed in detail. The concept we call in economics, 'production', and should call 'transformation' can only occur when forces locked within atoms are released as electromagnetic forces. (Gravitational forces exist because matter has been put 'there' by electromagnetic radiation). When 100 grams of dry grass fuel is burnt, about 2 megajoules of electromagnetic radiation are released. It was estimated that the coulombic forces between each electron and proton in that amount dry grass total 150 gigajoules (or giganewtons, since the reference is to forces). 9. Within the boundary of a simple economic activity, the ratio of aggregated coulombic forces locked up within atoms to the electromagnetic forces radiated out was estimated at the beginning of the activity, and then after a duration. The ratio of forces always tends towards 'evening out'. This measurement captures the entropy phenomenon which has been said by Georgescu-Roegen to be the basis of all economic activity. 10. At the roots of the economic paradigm founded by Adam Smith is the premise that the material world, as a set of substances, is a stage on which economic actors 'add value', bid prices up and down, and by their rational perception manage their livelihoods and surroundings well. From the findings of this research program it is contended that the surroundings of economic actors can be classed into two categories: locked up (coulombic) electromagnetic forces, and radiated electromagnetic forces. The former has a tendency to convert to the latter. All action, including all economic activity, and all life can be traced to a point in space and time where this conversion is (naturally) occurring. The phenomenon is analogous to a slope where water cascades, and gravitational potential energy converts to other (either useless or useful) forms of energy. To appreciate the nature of this phenomena, and to attempt to fathom its dimensions, sets our perceptions of ourselves as economic actors in a quite different and very humbling context.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entropy analysis</field><field name="subject">thermodynamics</field><field name="subject">Second Law of thermodynamics</field><field name="subject">economics</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">brickmaking</field><field name="subject">brick-making industry</field><field name="subject">locked up electromagnetic forces</field><field name="subject">coulombic electromagnetic forces</field><field name="subject">radiated electromagnetic forces</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070410.170509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Of The People, By The People, For The People' Workers' Compensation in Queensland: The Rise and Fall of a Policy Community</field><field name="creator">Cowan, Paula</field><field name="description">The central question posed in this thesis is why has the Queensland model of workers' compensation been so enduring?  The legislation remained largely intact from 1916 until 2001, with the exception of the years from 1996 to 1998.  This was so despite the fact the central feature of a state-controlled monopoly that underpinned this model was always potentially divisive in line with the variances between liberal-conservative traditions and social-democratic ideals that subsisted in broader political culture. In addressing this question of longevity, this thesis explores the capacity of an initially contentious piece of legislation to draw strong support from former opponents, and the argument is put forward that it is best explained through the development and operation of a policy community that fostered a shared set of core values relative to broad workers' compensation policy preferences.  These core values were compulsory state monopoly, no fault insurance and full access to common law.  Thus, the longevity of the legislation is attributed to the continued support by key stakeholders of these core values. The thesis also demonstrates that policy community relations deteriorated during the 1990s as governments responded to broader political pressures precipitated by reform agendas.  Inconsistencies in core values and policy outcomes for each stakeholder emerged as governments attempted to assert unprecedented control over the direction of workers' compensation in order to meet broader political goals. The legislation was threatened as relations within the policy community proved unsustainable when existing core values were contested.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Workers' compensation model</field><field name="subject">core value in government</field><field name="subject">state-controlled monopoly</field><field name="subject">policy community</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060223.103131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Speech Environmental Sound Classification System for Autonomous Surveillance</field><field name="creator">Cowling, Michael</field><field name="description">Sound is one of a human beings most important senses. After vision, it is the sense most used to gather information about the environment. Despite this, comparatively little research has been done into the field of sound recognition. The research that has been done mainly centres around the recognition of speech and music. Our auditory environment is made up of many sounds other than speech and music. This sound information can be taped into for the benefit of specific applications such as security systems. Currently, most researchers are ignoring this sound information. This thesis investigates techniques to recognise environmental non-speech sounds and their direction, with the purpose of using these techniques in an autonomous mobile surveillance robot. It also presents advanced methods to improve the accuracy and efficiency of these techniques. Initially, this report presents an extensive literature survey, looking at the few existing techniques for non-speech environmental sound recognition. This survey also, by necessity, investigates existing techniques used for sound recognition in speech and music. It also examines techniques used for direction detection of sounds.  The techniques that have been identified are then comprehensively compared to determine the most appropriate techniques for non-speech sound recognition. A comprehensive comparison is performed using non-speech sounds and several runs are performed to ensure accuracy. These techniques are then ranked based on their effectiveness. The best technique is found to be either Continuous Wavelet Transform feature extraction with Dynamic Time Warping or Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients with Dynamic Time Warping. Both of these techniques achieve a 70% recognition rate. Once the best of the existing classification techniques is identified, the problem of uncountable sounds in the environment can be addressed. Unlike speech recognition, non-speech sound recognition requires recognition from a much wider library of sounds. Due to this near-infinite set of example sounds, the characteristics and complexity of non-speech sound recognition techniques increases. To address this problem, a systematic scheme needs to be developed for non-speech sound classification. Several different approaches are examined. Included is a new design for an environmental sound taxonomy based on an environmental sound alphabet. This taxonomy works over three levels and classifies sounds based on their physical characteristics. Its performance is compared with a technique that generates a structured tree automatically. These structured techniques are compared for different data sets and results are analysed. Comparable results are achieved for these techniques with the same data set as previously used. In addition, the results and greater information from these experiments is used to infer some information about the structure of environmental sounds in general. Finally, conclusions are drawn on both sets of techniques and areas of future research stemming from this thesis are explored.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sound recognition</field><field name="subject">speech</field><field name="subject">non-speech</field><field name="subject">autonomous surveillance</field><field name="subject">robot</field><field name="subject">robots</field><field name="subject">robotics</field><field name="subject">classification</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040428.152425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship Between Sociocultural Influences and Disordered Eating Behaviours: Age-Related Differences in an Integrated Theoretical Model.</field><field name="creator">Coyne, Lucy C</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to a growing body of research examining the relationship between sociocultural influences and disordered eating behaviour. The aim of the current research was to extend on previously developed theoretical models to more closely examine agerelated differences in an integrated sociocultural model of disordered eating behaviour. The proposed model was informed by components of the dual-pathway model and the tripartite influence model. Nine-hundred and ninety-five women, from four different age groups (i.e., preadolescent, early adolescent, late adolescent and young adult), completed self-report measures of perceived pressure to be thin, modelling of disordered eating behaviour, media exposure, internalisation of the thin-ideal, social comparison, body dissatisfaction, body mass index, and disordered eating behaviour. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques, a sociocultural model of disordered eating was tested and found to have good fit to the data. A number of age-related differences in the strength of the relationship between variables were found. Interestingly, modelling of disordered eating behaviour was a direct predictor of disordered eating behaviour regardless of age group. As expected internalisation of the thin-ideal mediated between perceived pressure to be thin and body dissatisfaction for all age groups. Surprisingly, media exposure had few effects on internalisation, but was more strongly related to social comparison for the late adolescent and young adult age groups. Social comparison played a less significant role in predicting body dissatisfaction in preadolescent girls. However, for all other participants, social comparison predicted internalisation of the thin-ideal, body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviour. As expected, BMI predicted body dissatisfaction, and body dissatisfaction predicted disordered eating behaviour. The models accounted for between 60-64% of the variance in disordered eating behaviour. Implications for prevention programs are discussed in light of these findings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociocultural</field><field name="subject">Eating Behaviours</field><field name="subject">Disordered</field><field name="subject">Age-Related</field><field name="subject">Theoretical Model</field><field name="subject">Integrated</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071114.081853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploratory Study of the Social Psychological Determinants of Regular Participation in Leisure-Time Physical Activity</field><field name="creator">Craike, Melinda Jane</field><field name="description">Despite the widely documented physical, psychological, and social benefits of regular participation in physical activity (Bauman &amp; Campbell, 2001; Blair, Kohl &amp; Barlow, 1995; Paluska &amp; Schwenk, 2000; U.S Department of Health &amp; Human Services, 1996), less than half of the Australian population participate in 'sufficient' levels of physical activity in terms of time and frequency of participation (Bauman, Ford &amp; Armstrong, 2001).  Thus the examination of social psychological determinants of regular participation in leisure-time physical activity is important. A mixed methods approach was adopted to identify and test the important social psychological determinants of regular participation in leisure-time physical activity.  Phase one of the study was qualitative in nature and adopted a grounded theory approach.  A number of important themes emerged from the qualitative phase, including: definitions and meanings of physical activity; physical activity and choice, obligation, reasons for participation; enjoyment of physical activity; changing perceptions and influences on physical activity from childhood to adulthood; and priority of physical activity.  The interrelations between these themes and their impact on regularity of participation were explored.  These findings, along with theoretical propositions and evidence from previous studies, contributed to the development of a model of the social psychological determinants of regular participation in leisure-time physical activity.  They also contributed to the development of items to measure important concepts in the model.  Phase two was quantitative in nature and used structural equation modelling to test the model. The quantitative phase involved a sample of 250 people aged 19-87 years living in an Australian capital city.  Self-report questionnaires measured regularity of participation in leisure-time physical activity (dependent variable), leisure-time physical activity behaviour regulation, intrinsic motivation towards leisure-time physical activity, enjoyment of leisure-time physical activity, and priority of leisure-time physical activity (independent and mediating variables).  Each of the independent and mediating variables was multidimensional in nature, the components of which were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis in structural equation modelling prior to the testing of structural models.  After some adjustment, the predictors were satisfactorily represented by their respective multifactor models, except intrinsic motivation, which was best represented by a single factor model. Following modification, the proposed model of the social psychological determinants of regular participation in leisure-time physical activity was found to be a good fit of the data.  Relationships within the model indicated the importance of the priority of leisure-time physical activity factors in the prediction of regular participation in leisure-time physical activity.  The influence of preference for leisure-time physical activity on regular participation in leisure-time physical activity was mediated by level of priority and making time for leisure-time physical activity.  That is, people who preferred to participate in leisure-time physical activity over other types of leisure tended to make it a higher priority, and, in turn, tended to make time to participate.  Making time was subsequently associated with increased regularity of participation in leisure-time physical activity. The enjoyment factors influenced regular participation in leisure-time physical activity through their influence on preference for leisure-time physical activity.  Activity enjoyment had a positive influence on preference and enjoyment dependent on surroundings had a negative influence.  However, in the overall model, the behaviour regulators and intrinsic motivation attenuated the influence of the enjoyment factors on preference for leisure-time physical activity.  This suggested that people's underlying behaviour regulators and levels of intrinsic motivation have a similar influence on their preference for leisure-time physical activity as their feelings of enjoyment.  However, behaviour regulators and intrinsic motivation appear to be more powerful influences of preference than enjoyment. Intrinsic motivation towards leisure-time physical activity positively influenced regular participation in leisure-time physical activity through its influence on preference for leisure-time physical activity.  It also had a direct influence on regularity of participation.  Thus, people who were more intrinsically motivated tended to participate more regularly in leisure-time physical activity partly because they formed preferences for physical activity over other types of leisure.  Furthermore, the direct influence of intrinsic motivation on regular participation suggested that there were explanations, beyond that of preference and priority, for why those who were intrinsically motivated tended to participate more regularly in leisure-time physical activity. The behaviour regulators of external regulation (negative), introjected regulation (positive) and identified regulation (positive) influenced regularity of participation in leisure-time physical activity mostly through their influence on intrinsic motivation towards leisure-time physical activity.  That is, when people felt their physical activity was externally regulated, they felt less intrinsically motivated to participate and this was subsequently associated with less regular participation.  On the other hand, when people were regulated by introjection and identification, they tended to feel more intrinsically motivated and this was subsequently associated with more regular participation.  External regulation and introjected regulation also had a direct negative influence on preference for leisure-time physical activity and perceptions of the availability of time, respectively.  Thus, people who felt externally regulated tended to have less preference for leisure-time physical activity and those who were regulated through introjection were more likely to perceive that they did not have the time to participate. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by highlighting the importance of preferences and prioritisation on perceptions of time availability, and subsequently, regularity of participation in leisure-time physical activity.  It also demonstrated that behaviour regulators and intrinsic motivation are important determinants of regular participation in leisure-time physical activity in a general community sample.  These findings have theoretical and practical implications for researchers, leisure professionals, and policy makers.  They also suggest a number of significant areas of further research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leisure time physical activity</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">self-determination theory</field><field name="subject">intrinsic motivation</field><field name="subject">behaviour regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060810.154920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differential Gene Expression in Pathological and Physiological Cardiac Hypertrophy</field><field name="creator">Crampton, Matthew S</field><field name="description">Cardiac hypertrophy defines an adaptive process brought about in response to sustained increases in haemodynamic work. Cardiomyocytes undergo an initial compensatory phase in which enlargement and contractility alterations normalise wall stress and maintain adequate perfusion of organs. In pathological hypertrophy, this deteriorates to a decompensated state characterised by ventricular dysfunction and predisposition to heart failure. In contrast, physiological hypertrophy and associated enhanced cardiac functioning arising from chronic exercise training does not progress to heart failure. Determination of the molecular pathways underlying myocardial hypertrophy remains a challenge for cardiovascular research. The objective of the work presented in this thesis was to identify genes differentially expressed during pathological and physiological hypertrophy in order to enhance our knowledge of the mechanistic processes involved. A reverse Northern hybridisation method was applied to profile the expression of specifically selected genes in the hypertrophic models examined. Functional categories represented in the gene panel assembled included cardiac contractile and cytoskeletal markers, matrix metalloproteinases, vasoactive pathway factors, calcium handling genes, ion channels, cardiac regulatory factors, signalling pathway intermediates, apoptotic factors and histone deacetylases. In order to investigate pathological hypertrophy, a deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt) rat model was utilised. DOCA-salt treated rats used in this study demonstrated a 1.4-fold increase in heart weight to body weight ratio compared to controls. Impaired cardiac function indicative of a decompensated pathological phenotype in the DOCA-salt treated group was demonstrated by way of decreased chamber size, impaired myocardial compliance and significantly reduced cardiac output. Reverse Northern hybridisation analysis of 95 selected genes identified a number of candidates with differential expression in hearts of DOCA-salt treated rats. Increased gene expression was demonstrated for the collagenase MMP1 and stress-activated signal transduction factor Sin1. In contrast, the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase SERCA-2 and anti-apoptotic factor BCL2l-10 genes exhibited decreased expression. To investigate changes in gene expression associated with physiological hypertrophy, use was made of an endurance run-trained rat model. The run-trained rats used in this study demonstrated a 24.1% increase in heart weight to body weight ratio and improvements in performance consistent with physiological cardiac adaptation. These performance indicators included improvements in systolic volume, cardiac output, myocardial compliance and bio-energetic function. Reverse Northern hybridisation expression analysis of 56 genes identified a number of differentially expressed mRNA transcripts in run-trained hypertrophied hearts. Four genes shown to demonstrate reduced expression in the run-trained rat model were interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK1) and the developmentally expressed transcription factors Nkx-2.3, dHAND, and IRX-2. Based upon the reverse Northern hybridisation results, four genes were selected for Western blotting analysis of rat cardiac tissue. Of these, MMP1 and a putative isoform of Sin1 exhibited increased levels in DOCA-salt treated hypertrophic left ventricular tissue, results that correlate with the findings of increased mRNA expression for these two genes. Therefore, this study identified MMP1 and Sin1 as candidates involved in pathological but not physiological hypertrophy. This finding is in accord with other recent investigations demonstrating that pathological hypertrophy and physiological hypertrophy are associated with distinct molecular phenotypes. An aside to the major objective of identifying genes differentially regulated in left ventricular hypertrophy involved the application of the P19CL6 cell in vitro model of cardiomyogenesis to compare protein expression during hypertrophy and development. The Sin1 isoform, found to be up-regulated during DOCA-salt induced hypertrophy, was also shown to be more abundant in differentiating, than non-differentiating, P19CL6 cells. This result is consistent with the developing paradigm that implicates 'fetal' genes in the hypertrophic remodelling process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiac hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">cardiomyocytes</field><field name="subject">pathological hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">physiological hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">myocardial hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">Northern hybridisation analysis</field><field name="subject">differential gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070104.165826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bad Behaviour: The Prevention of Usability Problems Using GSE Models</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Alistair</field><field name="description">The aim of Human Computer Interaction or HCI is to both understand and improve the quality of the users' experience with the systems and technology they interact with. Recent HCI research requirements have stated a need for a unified predictive approach to system design that consolidates system engineering, cognitive modelling, and design principles into a single 'total system approach.' At present, few methods seek to integrate all three of these aspects into a single method and of those that do many are extensions to existing engineering techniques. This thesis, however proposes a new behaviour based approach designed to identify usability problems early in the design process before testing the system with actual users. In order to address the research requirements, this model uses a new design notation called Genetic Software Engineering (GSE) in conjunction with aspects of a cognitive modelling technique called NGOMSL (Natural GOMS Language) as the basis for this approach. GSE's behaviour tree notation, and NGOMSL's goal orientated format are integrated using a set of simple conversion rules defined in this study. Several well established design principles, believed to contribute to the eventual usability of a product, are then modelled in GSE. This thesis addresses the design of simple interfaces and the design of complex ubiquitous technology. The new GSE approach is used to model and predict usability problems in an extensive range of tasks from programming a VCR to making a video recording on a modern mobile phone. The validity of these findings is tested against actual user tests on the same tasks and devices to demonstrate the effectiveness of the GSE approach. Ultimately, the aim of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new cognitive and engineering based approach at predicting usability problems based on tangible representations of established design principles. This both fulfils the MCI research requirements for a 'total system approach' and establishes a new and novel approach to user interface and system design.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human computer interaction</field><field name="subject">genetic software engineering</field><field name="subject">natural GOMS language</field><field name="subject">cognitive modelling technique</field><field name="subject">user interface</field><field name="subject">system design</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061108.154141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Birthing and the development of trauma symptoms: Incidence and contributing factors</field><field name="creator">Creedy, Debra Kay</field><field name="description">Background: Little is known about the relationship between women's birthing experiences and the development of trauma symptoms. This study aimed to determine the incidence of acute trauma symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women as a result of their labor and delivery experiences, and identify factors that contributed to the women's psychological distress. Method: Using a prospective, longitudinal design, women in their last trimester of pregnancy were recruited from four public hospital antenatal clinics. Four to six weeks postpartum, telephone interviews were conducted with participants (n = 499) and explored the medical and midwifery management of the birth, perceptions of intrapartum care, and the presence of trauma symptoms. Results: One in three women (33%) identified a traumatic birthing event and reported the presence of at least three trauma symptoms. Twenty-eight women (5.6%) met DSM-IV criteria for acute posttraumatic stress disorder. Antenatal variables were not found to contribute to the development of acute or chronic trauma symptoms. The level of obstetric intervention experienced during childbirth (beta = .351, p &lt;.0001) and the perception of inadequate intrapartum care (beta = .319, p &lt;.0001) during labor were consistently associated with the development of acute trauma symptoms. Conclusions: Posttraumatic stress disorder following childbirth is an under-recognized phenomenon. Women who experienced both a high level of obstetric intervention and were dissatisfied with their intrapartum care were more likely to develop trauma symptoms than women who received a high level of obstetric intervention or women who perceived their care to be inadequate. Such findings should prompt a serious review of intrusive obstetric intervention during labor and delivery, and the psychological care provided to birthing women.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childbirth</field><field name="subject">trauma symptoms</field><field name="subject">posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">antenatal</field><field name="subject">obstetric intervention</field><field name="subject">satisfaction with care</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030102.101015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ARTSongs: The Soul Beneath My Skin</field><field name="creator">Croft, Pamela Joy</field><field name="description">This exegesis frames my studio thesis, which explores whether visual art can be a site for reconciliation, a tool for healing, an educational experience and a political act. It details how my art work evolved as a series of cycles and stages, as a systematic engagement with people, involving them in a process of investigating 'their' own realities - both the stories of their inner worlds and the community story framework of their outer conditions. It reveals how for my ongoing work as an indigenous artist, I became the learner and the teacher, the subject and the object. Of central importance for my exploration was the concept and methodology of bothways. As a social process, bothways action-learning methodology was found to incorporate the needs, motivations and cultural values of the learner through negotiated learning. Discussion of bothways methodology and disciplinary context demonstrated the relationships, connections and disjunctions shared by both Aboriginal and Western domains and informed the processes and techniques to position visual art as an educational experience and a tool for healing. From this emerged a range of ARTsongs - installations which reveal possible new alternatives sites for reconciliation, spaces and frames of reference to 'open our minds, heart and spirit so we can know beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable, so that we can think and rethink, so that we can create new visions, transgressions - a movement against and beyond boundaries' (hooks, 1994 p.12). Central to studio production was bricolage as an artistic strategy and my commitment to praxis  - to weaving together my art practice with hands-on political action and direct involvement with my communities. I refer to this as the trial and feedback process or SIDEtracks. These were documented acts of personal empowerment, which led to a more activist role in the political struggle of reconciliation. I conclude that, as aboriginal people, we can provide a leadership role, and in so doing, we can demonstrate to the wider community how to move beyond a state of apathy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">installations</field><field name="subject">installation art</field><field name="subject">bricolage</field><field name="subject">Australian aboriginal artists</field><field name="subject">minority art</field><field name="subject">minority arts</field><field name="subject">reconciliation</field><field name="subject">race relations</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030807.124830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Biogeochemical Modelling Analysis of the Potential For Marine Ecosystems to Regulate Climate By the Production of Dimethylsulphide</field><field name="creator">Cropp, Roger Allan</field><field name="description">The potential for life to control its environment was first suggested by Lovelock (1972). Charlson et al (1987) proposed a role for marine planktonic ecosystems in global climate regulation via the production and ventilation to the atmosphere of dimethylsulphide (DMS), a by-product of phytoplankton metabolism. Once in the atmosphere DMS contributes to the formation of cloud condensation nuclei, and increases the amount and brightness of cloud. This affects the albedo of the planet, reflecting more incident sunlight back into space, and cooling the earth. In common with many other 'hypotheses' regarding complex adaptive systems, the hypothesis proposed by Charlson et al (1987) is not experimentally testable. The production and ventilation to the atmosphere of DMS is the result of complex interactions between biological, chemical and physical processes. Consequently, increasing use is being made of mathematical models that simulate these processes to advance understanding of it (Archer et al. 2002). This study examines one of the fundamental mechanisms proposed by the Charlson et al (1987) hypothesis, that increasing global temperatures will lead to increased ventilation of DMS from the ocean to the atmosphere. The study develops one-dimensional biogeochemical models of DMS production by upper ocean ecosystems, based on the model proposed by Gabric et al. (1993b). The models are examined to elucidate their fundamental mathematical properties, and are subjected to sensitivity analysis to identify important processes and parameters. These investigations identify a simpler model that can reproduce the predictions of the Gabric et al. (1993b) model. Predictions derived from model simulations forced by climatologies of measured physical data are compared to a global database of measurements of sea surface DMS concentrations, and to observed depth profiles of DMS in the upper ocean. These comparisons confirm that all models are in good qualitative agreement with measured data. The fifteen global climate prediction models currently in use around the globe all predict substantial warming effects from the ventilation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. A simplified DMS model is calibrated to climatologies of Antarctic chlorophyll and DMS data and reproduces the data with great precision. The calibrated model is applied in global warming scenarios to 'test' the efficacy of the mechanism proposed by the Charlson et al (1987) hypothesis. This simulation provides evidence that the response predicted by the hypothesis is indeed feasible, and that substantial increases (up to 45%) in the ventilation of DMS to the atmosphere could be possible in some circumstances. The results of the modelling study provide impetus for further examination of field data. If couplings between marine biota and atmosphere are feasible, then they may be operating contemporarily, and may be detectable. Atmospheric DMS is oxidised to form aerosols (Miller et al. 2002) that influence the aerosol optical depth of the atmosphere. Archives of remote sensed ocean chlorophyll a concentration and aerosol optical depth are examined for evidence of the biologically mediated couplings. A clear coupling between aeolian dust and marine phytoplankton is evident from this analysis, suggesting that the deposition of dust from the atmosphere is a major factor controlling phytoplankton growth in many parts of the ocean. A second coupling between marine phytoplankton and atmospheric aerosols is also detected. This coupling is apparently not related to dust and is symmetrical about the equator, despite the substantial differences in the atmospheres and oceans of each hemisphere. It is speculated that this coupling may reflect the influence of the ventilation of DMS produced by marine phytoplankton on the atmosphere. This thesis provides new evidence supporting the important role of marine ecosystems in global climate regulation by the production of DMS. This evidence is principally obtained from a biogeochemical modelling approach, but is supported by analyses of empirical data. The concordance of results obtained from different approaches suggests that the contribution of marine ecosystems to global climate regulation is real, important and currently active.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biogeochemical modelling</field><field name="subject">ecosystem modelling</field><field name="subject">dimethylsulphide</field><field name="subject">DMS</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">marine ecosystems</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030703.101310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colonialism's Paradox: White Women, 'Race' and Gender in the Contact Zone 1850-1910</field><field name="creator">Crow, Rebekah</field><field name="description">This thesis is both an empirical history of white women in Queensland colonialism and a theoretical history of colonialism and imperialism in the late nineteenth century. It is a feminist history which seeks to fill the gap in our understanding of white women and 'race' in the contact zone in Queensland in the nineteenth century. At this level the thesis restores historical agency to women and reveals women's history as a powerful alternative to traditional colonial histories. It also positions this Queensland history within a global discourse of critical imperial histories that has emerged over the past decade, seeking to understand how British imperialism and Queensland colonialism shaped and informed each other in a two way process. The central themes of the thesis are 'race' and gender. I examine the ways in which white women deploy imperial ideologies of 'race' in the contact zone to position themselves as white women. 'Race' and gender are explored through the ways in which white women negotiated, in their writing, their relationships with Indigenous people and Pacific Islanders on the frontier and in the contact zone. The white women whose texts are examined in this thesis engaged with 'race' difference in their autobiographical accounts and these accounts, on many levels, allow us to rethink colonial history. I argue that colonialism is paradoxical and that white women experienced this colonial paradox in their daily lives and negotiated it in their writing. The white women whose writing is studied here were decent people with good intentions. They were simultaneously humanitarians (to differing degrees) and colonists. They were dependant for their livelihoods upon a violent colonisation and yet they were sympathetic to the Aboriginal people they interacted with. Often they were silenced in their opinions on the violence they witnessed. Writing was a means of navigating these contradictions. White women were in a relatively powerless position in the contact zone and there was little they could do to mitigate the violence that they saw. The tensions that resulted from living in the colonial paradox on frontiers and in the contact zone, of being a colonists and humanitarians, and of living in an uncontrollable existential situation is expressed in the writing of these women. This history offers us a more holistic understanding of the complexity of colonialism in Australia.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White women in Queensland</field><field name="subject">colonialism</field><field name="subject">imperialism</field><field name="subject">Queensland history</field><field name="subject">race and gender</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061009.115837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Candidate Gene Analysis of Migraine Susceptibility Regions on Chromosome 1q and 19p</field><field name="creator">Curtain, Robert</field><field name="description">Migraine is a common, debilitating neurovascular disease charactensed by severe recurrent headache, nausea and vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. It is clinically diagnosed based on criteria specified by the International Headache Society (IHS), defining two major classes of migraine: migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO) MA sufferers experience neurovascular disturbances that precede the headache phase of an attack. Although migraine is partly influenced by environmental determinants, there is a significant genetic component, with disease heritability estimated to be up to 60% and mode of transmission multifactorial. The disorder is common with a large Dutch study reporting lifetime prevalence estimates of 33% in women and 13.3% in men, with an earlier study estimating 24% of women and 12% of men in the overall population. Mutations in various ion channel genes are responsible for neuromuscular and other neurological disorders. Inherited ion channel mutations or 'channelopathies' are increasingly found to be the cause of various neurological disorders in humans. In familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), a rare subtype of migraine with aura, mutations in the CACNA1A gene (localised at C19p13) have been fbund (FHM1). This gene codes for the alphalA subunit of the neuronal voltage-dependent P/Q-type calcium channel. Recently a second gene, ATP1A2 (FHM2) (localised at C1q23), was implicated in some EHM families. The ATP1A2 ion channel gene, codes for the alpha2 subunit of the Na+, K+ ion ATPase pump. These findings of mutations in these genes have focused attention on central nervous system ionic channels and helped to better understand EHM pathophysiology, where the best genetic evidence providing molecular insight into migraine still comes flom the mutations detected in the rare form of migraine with aura; FHM. Migraine family studies, at the Genomic Research Centre (GRC), have utilised linkage analysis methods in providing results that have indicated suggestive linkage to the FHM1-CACNA1A region on l9p13, in a large multigenerational family (Migraine Family 1; MEl) affected with typical migraine. Also linkage studies conducted within the GRC have implicated an additional susceptibility region on chromosome 1q31, but still not ruling out a second susceptibility region on C1q23, with the possibility of there being two distinct loci, on the chromosome lq region. The focus of research in this thesis is on two main chromosomal regions, which were tested for migraine susceptibility on chromosome 1 and chromosome 19. The research involved a cross-disciplinary approach utilising association, linkage and mutation screening approaches. Allelic candidate gene studies can provide a suitable method for locating genes of small effect that contribute to complex genetic disorders, such as migraine. Family linkage studies are useful for detection of chromosomal susceptibility regions and association studies are powerful when a plausible candidate gene and a sequence variant with potential functional relevance is examined. Mutation screening studies can indicate a direct cause of disorders such as migraine, where possible sequence variants may alter the translation of proteins in genes, causing the disease. The first gene exanted on chromosome 19 was that of the Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR) gene. The LDLR gene is a cell surface receptor that plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis. We investigated the (TA)n polymorphism in exon 18 of the LDLR gene on chromosome l9pl3.2 performing an association analysis in 244 typical migraine affected patients, 151 suffering from migraine with aura, 96 with migraine without aura and 244 unaffected controls. The populations consisted of Caucasians only and controls were age and sex matched. The results showed no significant difference between groups for allele frequency distributions of the (TA)n polymorphism even after separation of the migraine affected individuals into subgroups of MA and MO affected patients. This is in contradiction to Mochi et al, 2003 who found a positive association of this variant with MO. Our study discusses possible differences between the two studies and extends this research by investigating circulating cholesterol levels in a migraine affected genetically-isolated population. Another gene examined on chromosome l9pl3 was the insulin receptor gene (1NSR). The aim of this study was to investigate through direct sequencing the INSR gene in DNA samples from a migraine affected family previously showing linkage to chromosome l9pl3 in an attempt to detect disease associated mutations. The insulin receptor gene (INSR) on chromosome 19pl3.3-13.2 is a gene of interest since a number of SNPs located within the gene have been implicated in migraine with (MA) and without aura (MO). Six DNA samples obtained from non-founding migraine affected members of migraine family one (MF 1) were used in this study. Genomic DNA was sequenced for the 1NSR gene in exons 1-22 and the promoter region. In the six migraine family member samples, previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP5) were detected within two exonic DNA coding regions of the INSR gene. These SNPs, in exon 13 and 17, do not alter the normal INSR polypeptide sequence. In addition, intron 7 also revealed a DNA base sequence variation. For the 5' untranslated promoter region of the gene, no mutations were detected. In conclusion, this study detected no INSR mutations in affected members of a chromosome 19 linked migraine pedigree. Hence, migraine linkage to this chromosomal region may involve other candidate genes. The NOTCH3 gene on C19p13.2-p13.l has previously been shown to be a gene involved in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and may also be implicated in migraine as there are some symptom similarities between the two disorders. The TNFSF7 gene localised on Cl9pl3 is homologous to the ligands of the TNF receptor family, including TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, genes that have both been previously associated with migraine. This study investigated the migraine susceptibility locus at Cl9p13 studying two genes that may be involved in the disorder. The NOTCH3 gene was analysed by sequencing all exons with known CADASIL mutations in a family (MF1) that has previously been shown to be linked to Cl9pl3. The sequencing results for affected members of this pedigree proved to be negative for all known sequence variants giving rise to mutation causing amino acid changes for CADASIL. The direct sequencing results displayed that of a normal coding sequence for the NOTCH3 gene F or the TNFSF7 gene, this was investigated through SNP association analysis using a matched case-control migraine diagnosed population. Chi-square results showed non-significant P values across all populations tested against controls except for the MO subgroup which displayed a weak association with the TNFSF7 SNP (genotype, allele analysis P = 0.036, P = 0 017 respectively). Our results suggest that common migraine is not caused by any known CADASIL mutations in the NOTCH3 gene of interest however, the TNFSF7 gene displayed signs of involvement in a MO affected population, but, further studies are needed to confirm these results and to further explore a TNF receptor - migraine potential interaction. A final examination on chromosome 19 involved a case report of an extremely rare and severe form of migraine. As stated earlier Familial Hemiplegic Migraine (FHM) is a severe rare sub-type of migraine and gene mutations on chromosome 19 have been identified in the calcium channel gene CACNA1A (Cl9pl3) fOr FHM. Recently a gene mutation (S218L) for a dramatic syndrome originating from FHM, commonly named 'migraine coma', has implicated exon 5 of the CACNA1A gene. The occurrence of trivial head trauma, in FHM patients, may also be complicated by severe, sometimes even fatal, cerebral edema and coma occurring after a lucid interval. Hemiplegic migraine has also been found to be sporadic in which both forms share a similar spectrum of clinical presentations and genetic heterogeneity. The case report presented in this study enhances the involvement of the S218L CACNA1A mutation in the extremely rare disorder of minor head trauma induced migraine coma. It not only proves to be a powerful diagnostic tool in detecting cases of FHM head trauma induced coma but also for sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM) coma subjects. We conclude from this case study that the S218L mutation, in the CACNA1A calcium channel subunit gene, is involved in sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM), delayed cerebral edema and coma after minor head trauma. This thesis also involved analysis of chromosome 1 for migraine susceptibility, where FHM studies provided a foundation fOr common migraine research on chromosome 1. Studies have suggested that mutations in the CACNA1A gene on chromosome l9p cause FHM in only approximately 50% of affected pedigrees. The CACNAIA gene has previously been tested, within the Genomics Research Centre, in the common forms of migraine; however no new mutations or the FHM mutations were detected in these MA/MO affected samples. A second FHM susceptibility locus maps to chromosome 1q23 and mutations in the ATP1A2 gene have recently been implicated in two Cl-linked FHM pedigrees. As FHM is considered a rare and severe form of MA, it is possible that the chromosome 1q23 locus, and the ATP1A2 gene, may be involved in the common forms of migraine with (MA) and possibly without aura (MO). Also, we have previously reported evidence of linkage to microsatellite markers on chromosome 1q31 in a large pedigree affected predominately with MA, which suggests the possibility that there are two distinct loci for migraine susceptibility on chromosome 1. The objectives of this study were to extend our linkage analysis of chromosome lq microsatellite markers in predominantly migraine with aura pedigrees. Also, our aim was to test the novel FHM-2 ATP1A2 gene for involvement in these migraine affected pedigrees and a previous pedigree (Migraine Family 14; MF 14) showing evidence of linkage of markers to Clq31. This was performed by a chromosome 1 scan (31 markers) in 21 multiplex pedigrees affected mainly with MA. Also, the known FHM-2 ATP1A2 gene mutations were tested, by sequencing, fOr involvement in MA and MO in these pedigrees. Mutation screening by direct sequencing was also performed throughout the coding areas of the ATP1A2 gene in 3 MA individuals fiom MF14. The results of this study detected evidence for linkage in our migraine pedigrees at chromosome 1q23, to microsatellite markers spanning the ATP1A2 (FHM-2) gene. However testing of the known ATP1A2 gene mutations (for FHM) in migraine probands of pedigrees showing excess allele sharing was negative, with no mutations detected in these migraineurs. Sequencing of the entire coding areas of the gene through 3 MA affecteds from MF14, a pedigree showing significant linkage to this region, was also negative for mutations. In conclusion, this study reported that microsatellite markers on chromosome 1q23 show evidence of excess allele sharing in MA and some MO pedigrees, suggesting linkage to the common forms of migraine and the presence of a susceptibility gene in this region. The new FHM-2 (ATPIA2 gene) mutations reported by Fusco et al, 2003 do not cause migraine in probands of affected pedigrees showing excess allele sharing to markers in this genomic region. Also no mutations were detected in all exons of the ATP1A2 gene in 3 MA affected individuals from a large pedigree (MF14) showing linkage to this region. Investigation in this thesis continued on chromosome 1, with other genes being examined on C1q23, as well as the C1q31 region for a migraine susceptibility locus or gene. Previously in our laboratory, evidence for linkage was shown to migraine at C1q31 in one family predominantly affected with MA, with microsatellite markers in this region. The initial Cl study (above; ATP1A2 gene) has also provided evidence for linkage to the chromosome 1 locus 1q23, with evidence for excess allele sharing of markers in predominantly MA affected pedigrees. To further investigate both chromosome I loci, an investigation with six candidate genes that lie within the C1q23 and 1q31 regions through association analysis was undertaken. The results from this study reported non-significant chi-square results, showing P values greater than 0.05 across all SNPs (and a CA rpt) tested. An exception was the rs704326 SNP from exon 43 of the CACNA1E gene on C1q31. P values significantly less than 0.001 were obtained in the total migraine population and the MA subgroup, with similar frequency comparisons ascertained in both genotype and allele analysis. Examination through contingency table analysis of the CACNA1E flequency data indicated that the risk allele (A) was over-represented in the migraine group compared to the control group. Further comparison of the genotype data indicated a difference in frequency distributions (P less than 0 0001). Stratified analyses of migraine subtypes indicated that this association was specifically attributed to the MA subtype group. Odds ratios produced an OR of 4.14 with a 95% CI of 2.36 - 7.26 (P less than 0.0001). The positive association results obtained within the CACNA1E gene are interesting in the fact that FHM is considered to be a rare and severe form of migraine with aura (MA) and FHM-1 is caused by mutations contained within the calcium channel gene CACNA1A (localized at Cl9p13). The idea that FHM and specifically an FHM gene in the C1q31 genomic region may also contribute to susceptibility to the more common forms of migraine i e. migraine with aura, strongly supports and reinforces the idea that a common defective gene may be influencing both FHM and typical migraine. In conclusion, this thesis undertook a cross-disciplinary approach to genetic research of a complex disorder. The research involved linkage, association and mutation analysis strategies of migraine. This research implicated a specific variant on chromosome 1 and further supported the heterogeneic nature of migraine. Future directions into migraine research should involve further investigation of this specific variant and this genomic region. Such studies may aid in the development of more precise diagnosis and treatment methods for this complex disorder.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Migraine research</field><field name="subject">migraine with aura</field><field name="subject">migraine without aura</field><field name="subject">CACNA1A gene</field><field name="subject">insulin receptor gene</field><field name="subject">19p13.3</field><field name="subject">single nucleotide polymorphisms</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070810.132610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Made in the Image of the Church: The Transmission of Church-Based Values</field><field name="creator">Dalseno, Michael Peter</field><field name="description">Following the completion of four minor research projects as part of a doctoral program at Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia, the writer developed an interest in the church-based values and beliefs held by students in Ministry Training Colleges (MTCs). The four minor projects revealed that a strongly embedded culture seemed to exist within the Assemblies Of God (AOG) in Australia. The aim of this study was to investigate the transmission of church-based values to students in an AOG, Ministry Training College (MTC) context. It undertakes this task by asking five Research Questions: What values are transmitted in AOG church contexts? ; From what principal sources do the values come? ; Why are the values transmitted in AOG church contexts? ; How, and by what means, are these values transmitted? ; and How and why would students choose to acquire these values? After briefly describing the religious context in Australia, defining the meaning of values, and examining various models of transfer, the dissertation includes a review of the literature relevant to values processes. The review is organized according to the Research Questions. From this, a theoretical explanation is produced that anticipates how values processes may impact on MTC students in an AOG context. A suitable method was selected, namely interactive interviews, from which to obtain data relevant to the Research Questions. Six student subjects from a MTC in Australia, as a selected group of AOG participants, were subsequently interviewed and the data were organized, presented and analyzed. The data analysis and interpretation confirmed the theoretical position taken as far as their overall applicability to values transfer was concerned, namely: the values transmitted are primarily charismatic values, with some lesser emphasis on character values; the sources from which the values come are primarily Christian-influenced; the values are transmitted in AOG contexts because AOG churches, departments and ministries aim to be change agents in the community, to promote church continuance, and to a lesser extent, to motivate their members; the values are transmitted through various AOG communicative methods and through utilizing suitable venues for facilitating transmission. Low-Road conditions (i.e., transferring values across highly similar situations) are utilized; and MTC students choose to acquire values because of their personal interests and passions, including their desire to be accepted within the AOG church. However, the data also indicate that the unique, personal characteristics of MTC students strongly impact on the way they engage with values processes. In short, the students are highly compliant and committed to the church. However, each student respondent has his/her own set of reasons and characteristics for cooperating with church-based values. The dissertation concludes by identifying a number of issues raised by the data, that need further investigation, and by discussing some of the implications arising from the data. Its key finding is that AOG students tend to eagerly acquire church-based values, even though they have different reasons for doing so, and that they present themselves to the AOG church as highly compliant. In this sense, students may be seen as &amp;quotmade in the image of the church&amp;quot.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">christian education</field><field name="subject">minister training</field><field name="subject">Assemblies of God</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">values</field><field name="subject">church-based values</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030731.102027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influences on and Effectiveness of Environmemntal Policy-Making and Implementation in Japan: The Issue of Wildlife Preservation</field><field name="creator">Danaher, Mike</field><field name="description">This dissertation provides a descriptive-analytic study of the reasons and influences underlying Japan's less than progressive policy record on wildlife preservation, domestically and globally, since 1980. This research is important for a number of reasons, but mainly it helps us to test a number of theoretical models about: policy-making in Japan; Japanese environmental diplomacy; social movements; and corporatism. I hypothesise that apart from a common sense of purpose that binds the different policy actors together, Japan's poor record on wildlife preservation is a derivative of the way environmental NGOs have been marginalised and excluded from the policy process. This hypothesis links to Japan's public safety, and food and economic security concerns whereby these concerns tend to frame and guide policy-making on wildlife and nature issues. Using case study and participant observation methodologies to gather empirical evidence, this dissertation analyses both Japanese state behaviour towards global and domestic wildlife issues, and the changing relationships between the Japanese state, foreign pressure and environmental NGOs, in order to confirm or deny the hypothesis. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Ramsar Convention are the two environmental regimes which provide the context and issues for the analyses. The research concludes that there is convincing evidence to support the hypothesis. The research also reveals the positive, although subtle, sea changes which are occurring in Japanese environmental politics in the light of the continuing changes taking place in both Japan's broader political economy and in the international community.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental policy making</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">wildlife preservation</field><field name="subject">CITES</field><field name="subject">Ramsar Convention</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051103.145726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Third Turn as a Teachable Moment in Foreign Language Pedagogy</field><field name="creator">Dashwood, Ann</field><field name="description">Talk is the vehicle of exchange in language classrooms when communicative competence is being developed. Turns of talk then facilitate the meaning-making process as students and teachers collaboratively come to understand the discourse of knowledge they are co-constructing. During the pivotal third turn in the essential teaching exchange, there is potential for teachers to realise productive pedagogies as they facilitate their students' organisational and pragmatic skills in the foreign language. This study brings a lens to Initiation-Response-Evaluation (IRE) triadic dialogue, which has been criticised for its monological overuse and limitation of students' language production. Analysis of the third turn shows the uptake to be an implicit move in the exchange. Teachers appear not to be aware of the potential benefit it offers them for co-constructed language use at that point in teacher-student interactions. Teachers draw on students' background knowledge and experiential learning in the four domains of productive pedagogies (intellectual quality, supportive classroom environment, recognition of difference and connectedness) when they engage them through an authentic use of language. For this study, potential for productive pedagogy was investigated in the classroom talk of two teachers of Japanese at year 10 level. In a case study, six transcribed and translated lessons were subjected to conversational and membership categorisation analyses using Bachman's (1990) communicative language ability framework to describe language production around the third turn and to hypothesise its effectiveness in providing opportunities for students to generate output in the target language.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Initial-response-evaluation</field><field name="subject">foreign language pedagogy</field><field name="subject">classroom dialogue</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060810.092724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquisition and Analysis of Aquatic Stroke Data From an Accelerometer Based System</field><field name="creator">Davey, Neil P.</field><field name="description">The aim of this work was to develop devices for elite athletes to record performance related parameters during their training. A device was initially designed and built for rowing to record the motion of the boat. This was to gain understanding of motion signals in a one dimensional plane. The device uses a iPAQ handheld computer for recording and display of data to the user. Using the knowledge obtained from the accelerometer data of the rowing system an initial prototype device was designed and constructed for use in swimming. This device was required to be wearable whilst the swimmer was training, thus it had to record the data onboard. A second version of the swimming device was constructed to improve the usability of the device. The swimming device has fully sealed electronics, wireless charging and infrared communications. The device records three dimensional acceleration patterns at 150Hz, and can store over 6 hours of data using the internal memory. The device can operate for greater than 12 hours before needing to be recharged. The data collected from the swimming device was used to develop processing algorithms to extract when the swimmers push off from the wall, the type of stroke they are swimming, and for freestyle the stroke count. The results of the wall push off algorithm were compared against manual hand timing with 90% algorithm results being with &#177;1 second of the hand timing data. The stroke type identification algorithm determines which stroke is being swum and presently has an accuracy of 95%. The results of the freestyle stroke count algorithm were compared against manual stroke counts from raw accelerometers data and underwater video. Of the 164 data sets analysed over 90% of the algorithm results were within &#177;1 strokes of the manual recorded stroke counts.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquatic stroke data</field><field name="subject">swimming device</field><field name="subject">accelerometer</field><field name="subject">acceleration patterns</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061003.153043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational climate and its influence upon performance: A study of Australian hotels in South East Queensland</field><field name="creator">Davidson, Michael Cameron Gordon</field><field name="description">This study gathered data from 14 four to five-star hotels in South-East Queensland, Australia, in an attempt to examine the nature and degree of influence organisational climate has upon the performance of hotels. Employee perception of customer satisfaction was studied both as an index of performance and as an intervening variable between organisational climate and financial performance as indexed by revenue per available room (REVPAR). The data provided a description of a young, relatively gender balanced, well educated and trained work force which received relatively low levels of financial remuneration and displayed very high levels of turnover. A new instrument was used to measure the dimensions of organisational climate across the hotels. This instrument represented a modification of that presented by Ryder and Southey (1990), which itself was a modification of the 145 item psychological climate questionnaire of Jones and James (1979). The instrument represented a subset of 70 items of the Ryder and Southey instrument. Responses to all items within the instrument were on a 7 point anchored scale. Principal components analysis (PCA) produced results consistent with earlier versions of the instrument, which had been reported elsewhere. This analysis described organisational climate within the sample to be composed of 7 underlying dimensions; Leader facilitation and support, Professional and organisational esprit, Conflict and ambiguity, Regulations, organisation and pressure, Job variety, challenge and autonomy, Workgroup co-operation, friendliness and warmth, and Job standards. These dimensions were judged to be consistent with those reported earlier by Jones and James, and by Ryder and Southey. Poor support was found for the first structural model that proposed that employee demographic variables would affect organisational climate and that organisational climate would affect customer satisfaction (although the latter link was quite strong). The most important finding of the study was the support for a second structural model when it was found that variation in the 7 dimensions of organisational climate accounted for 30% of the variation in Employee Perception of Customer Satisfaction. Furthermore, that Employee Perception of Customer Satisfaction accounted for 23% of the variation in REVPAR between the hotels. Possible extensions of this study using direct measures of customer satisfaction and expanding it to include hotels of different star ratings are discussed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational climate</field><field name="subject">hotels</field><field name="subject">hotel</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">southeast</field><field name="subject">south east Queensland</field><field name="subject">south east</field><field name="subject">hotel management</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030102.103647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of Transformational Leadership by Personality Constructs for Senior Australian Organisational Executive Leaders</field><field name="creator">Davies, Malcolm Roy</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis was to investigate prediction of senior leader transformational leadership behaviour.  Transformational leadership was identified as a major theory with substantial practical implications for economic prosperity.  It was argued that a better understanding of what predicts transformational behaviour would assist in creating a lift in the effective application of the theory with attendant benefits for all organisational stakeholders. It was proposed that personality components would predict transformational behaviour.  Personality was conceptualised in two ways: as components of the Five Factor Model of personality and as personality disorder components.  Specifically, eight personality constructs were hypothesised as predictors.  They were three Hogan Personality Inventory based Five Factor Model components and the five Hogan Development Survey personality disorder components.  It was further proposed that self-subordinate rating agreement would moderate the prediction of transformational behaviour by the selected personality components.  A survey research methodology was used to gather data from senior Australian organisational executive leaders.  Two samples were accessed while subjects were attending training or strategy seminars.  The samples incorporated a total of 462 individual senior leader subjects and 1,881 of their subordinates drawn from the top four levels of a range of large multi-level public and private Australian organisations.  It was argued that the sample validly represent a senior executive cohort of organisational leaders.  Subject leaders completed a brief demographic questionnaire, the leader version of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, and either the Hogan Personality Inventory or the Hogan Development Survey.  Subjects' subordinates completed the rater version of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire.  Transformational behaviour was operationalised as charisma, which was calculated as the mean of two subordinate rated transformational components of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, viz., idealised behaviour and inspirational motivation.  This dependent variable was regressed on the various personality variables to assess predictive ability.  Moderation of the prediction of transformational leadership behaviour by personality components was assessed by multiple regression of transformational leadership behaviour on the various personality components within self-subordinate rating agreement categories. There were eight specific original contributions from the findings of this thesis.  The HPI component ambition was found to positively predict charisma. The HPI component prudence was found to negatively predict charisma.  Self subordinate rating agreement operationalised as an absolute difference score was found to moderate the level of prediction by whole HPI regression model and some of the relationships and predictions of charisma by individual HPI components.  It was found that prevalence of personality disorder components among senior executives varied from six percent to 34 percent of the sample cases.  The HDS personality disorder components sceptical and cautious were found to negatively predict charisma; whereas the HDS component imaginative was found to positively predict charisma.  Self subordinate rating agreement operationalised as a relative difference score was found to moderate the whole HDS regression model and some but not all of the relationships and predictions of charisma by individual HDS components.  Theoretical and practical implications of the above findings, limitations of this research and recommendations for future research were discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transformational leadership</field><field name="subject">executive leaders</field><field name="subject">personality components</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060220.142914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovation Through Action Research in Environmental Education: From Project to Praxis</field><field name="creator">Davis, Julie Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis is a work-in-progress that articulates my research journey based on the development of a curriculum innovation in environmental education. This journey had two distinct, but intertwined phases: action research based fieldwork, conducted collaboratively, to create a whole school approach to environmental education curriculum planning; and a phase of analysis and reflection based on the emerging findings, as I sought to create personal "living educational theory" about change and innovation.  A key stimulus for the study was the perceived theory-practice gap in environmental education, which is often presented in the literature as a criticism of teachers for failing to achieve the values and action objectives of critical environmental education. Hence, many programs and projects are considered to be superficial and inconsequential in terms of their ability to seriously address environmental issues. The intention of this study was to work with teachers in a project that would be an exemplar of critical environmental education. This would be in the form of a whole school "learnscaping" curriculum in a primary school whereby the schoolgrounds would be utilised for interdisciplinary critical environment education. Parallel with the three cycles of action research in this project, my research objectives were to identify and comment upon the factors that influence the generation of successful educational innovation.  It was anticipated that the project would be a collaboration involving me, as researcher-facilitator, and many of the teachers in the school as active participants. As the project proceeded through its action cycles, however, it became obvious that the goal of developing a critical environmental education curriculum, and the use of highly participatory processes, were unrealistic. Institutional and organisational rigidities in education generally, teachers' day-to-day work demands, and the constant juggle of work, family and other responsibilities for all participants acted as significant constraints. Consequently, it became apparent that the learnscaping curriculum would not be the hoped-for exemplar. Progress was slow and, at times, the project was in danger of stalling permanently. While the curriculum had some elements of critical environmental education, these were minor and not well spread throughout the school. Overall, the outcome seemed best described as a "small win"; perhaps just another example of the theory-practice gap that I had hoped this project would bridge.  Towards the project's end, however, my continuing reflection led to an exploration of chaos/complexity theory which gave new meaning to the concept of a "small win". According to this theory, change is not the product of linear processes applied methodically in purposeful and diligent ways, but emerges from serendipitous events that cannot be planned for, or forecast in advance. When this perspective of change is applied to human organisations - in this study, a busy school - the context for change is recognised not as a stable, predictable environment, but as a highly complex system where change happens all the time, cannot be controlled, and no one can be really sure where the impacts might lead. This so-called "butterfly effect" is a central idea of this theory where small changes or modifications are created - the effects of which are difficult to know, let alone determine - and which can have large-scale impacts.  Allied with this effect is the belief that long term developments in an organisation that takes complexity into account, emerge by spontaneous self-organising evolution, requiring political interaction and learning in groups, rather than systematic progress towards predetermined goals or "visions". Hence, because change itself and the contexts of change are recognised as complex, chaos/complexity theory suggests that change is more likely to be slow and evolutionary - cultural change - rather than fast and revolutionary where the old is quickly ushered out by radical reforms and replaced by new structures and processes. Slow, small-scale changes are "normal", from a complexity viewpoint, while rapid, wholesale change is both unlikely and unrealistic. Therefore, the frustratingly slow, small-scale, imperfect educational changes that teachers create - including environmental education initiatives - should be seen for what they really are. They should be recognised as successful changes, the impacts of which cannot be known, but which have the potential to magnify into large-scale changes into the future. Rather than being regarded as failures for not meeting critical education criteria, "small wins" should be cause for celebration and support.  The intertwined phases of collaborative action research and individual researcher reflection are mirrored in the thesis structure. The first three chapters, respectively, provide the thesis overview, the literature underpinning the study's central concern, and the research methodology. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 report on each of the three action research cycles of the study, namely Laying the Groundwork, Down to Work!, and The Never-ending Story. Each of these chapters presents a narrative of events, a literature review specific to developments in the cycle, and analysis and critique of the events, processes and outcomes of each cycle. Chapter 7 provides a synthesis of the whole of the study, outlining my interim propositions about facilitating curriculum change in schools through action research, and the implications of these for environmental education.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">fieldwork</field><field name="subject">field work</field><field name="subject">curriculum design</field><field name="subject">curriculum planning</field><field name="subject">curriculum innovation</field><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="subject">theory</field><field name="subject">practice</field><field name="subject">praxis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040618.110511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical Investigations of Great Barrier Reef Ascidians - Natural Product and Synthetic Studies</field><field name="creator">Davis, Rohan Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the chemical investigations of several ascidian species collected from the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. The thesis is divided into two separate components, Part A focuses on the isolation and structure elucidation of 11 previously undescribed ascidian metabolites. All structures were assigned using a combination of spectroscopic and/or chemical methods. Part B relates to the isolation and chemical conversion of a natural product to a combinatorial template. The natural product template was subsequently used in the generation of a solution-phase combinatorial chemistry library. A further two combinatorial libraries were generated from a synthesised model compound that was related to the natural product template. Part A. Investigation of Aplidium longithorax collected from the Swains Reefs resulted in the isolation of two new para-substituted cyclofarnesylated quinone derived compounds, longithorones J (30) and K (31). The former compound had its absolute stereochemistry determined by the advanced Mosher method. From an Aplidium longithorax collected from Heron Island, two new cyclofarnesylated hydroquinone compounds, longithorols C (46) and D (47) and a novel macrocyclic chromenol, longithorol E (48) were isolated. Longithorol C (46) had its absolute stereochemistry determined by the advanced Mosher method. Chemical investigation of the deep-purple colonial ascidian, Didemnum chartaceum collected from Swains Reefs led to the isolation of five new lamellarin alkaloids, which included the 20-sulfated derivatives of lamellarins B (94), C (95) and L (96), the 8-sulfated derivative of lamellarin G (97) and the non-sulfated compound, lamellarin Z (98). The known lamellarins A (63), B (80), C (64), E (65), G (67), and L (71) plus the triacetate derivatives of lamellarin D (82) and N (83) were also isolated. An aberration in the integration of signals in the 1H NMR spectra of the 20-sulfated derivatives (94-96) led to NMR relaxation studies. T1 values were calculated for all protons in the sulfated lamellarins (94-97) and their corresponding non-sulfated derivatives (80, 64, 71, 67). The protons ortho to the sulfate group in compounds (94-97) had T1 values up to five times larger than the corresponding protons in their non-sulfated derivatives (80, 64, 71, 67). A specimen of Eudistoma anaematum collected from Heron Island was shown to contain a new b-carboline alkaloid, eudistomin V (130), in addition to the two known metabolites, eudistomin H (105) and I (106). Part B. The known natural products, 1,3-diphenethylurea (29), 1,3-dimethylxanthine (30), 1,3-dimethylisoguanine (31) and the salts of tambjamine C (16), E (18) and F (19) were isolated from the ascidian, Sigillina signifera collected in Blue Lagoon, Lizard Island. Base hydrolysis on mixtures of the salts of tambjamine C (16), E (18) and F (19) resulted in the production of 4-methoxy-2,2-bipyrrole-5-carbaldehyde (26). This natural product template (26) was used in the generation of an enamine combinatorial chemistry library (98, 103-111) using solution-phase parallel synthesis. The biaryl compound, 4-(2-thienyl)-1H-pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde (59) was successfully synthesised using Suzuki-Miyaura coupling conditions and subsequently used as a template in the generation of an amine (67, 77, 80-87) and imine (78, 92-95) combinatorial library using solution-phase parallel synthesis.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ascidian</field><field name="subject">ascidians</field><field name="subject">sea squirt</field><field name="subject">sea squirts</field><field name="subject">Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">natural product</field><field name="subject">synthetic studies</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030102.104858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuronal Differentiation: A Study Into Differential Gene Expression</field><field name="creator">De las Heras, Rachel</field><field name="description">Neuronal differentiation encompasses an elaborate developmental program which until recently was difficult to study in vitro. The advent of several cell lines able to differentiate in culture proved to be the turning point for gaining an understanding of molecular neuroscience. In particular the olfactory epithelium provides an attractive tool with which to investigate fundamental questions relating to neuronal differentiation, as it displays a unique capacity to regenerate and to retain a neurogenetic potential from its genesis and throughout adult life. The coordinated regulation of gene expression is fundamental to the control of neuronal differentiation. In order to reveal active processes at the molecular level and to dissect key components of molecular pathways, differential gene expression studies provide a foundation for the elucidation of dynamic molecular mechanisms. This thesis identified genes involved in neuronal differentiation by utilising a clonal olfactory receptor neuronal cell line (OLF442). Gene expression levels were identified using differential display and oligonucleotide array technology before and after serum deprivation. Differential display revealed two kinases whose expression levels were elevated during the differentiation of OLF442, identified as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) related non-kinase (FRNK) and mammalian ste20 like (MST)2 kinase. Furthermore, analysis of the oligonucleotide array data confirmed the expression of genes involved in altering presentation of extracellular matrix molecules, in mediating cytoskeletal rearrangements, and in ceasing the cell cycle, supporting the use of OLF442 as a model for studying differentiation. The differentiation of OLF442 results from the synchronisation of multiple transduction cascades and cellular responses as evidenced by the microarray data. A protein that can synchronise such signalling is the non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase, FAK. Thus the finding of the endogenous FAK inhibitor FRNK by differential display was intriguing as there was no difference in the expression level of FAK induced by differentiation, contrasting that of FRNK. This induced FRNK expression was derived autonomously as it was not responsive to the caspase-3 inhibitor, DEVD-CHO. This is particularly pertinent since the primary role of FRNK is to act as an inhibitor of FAK by competing with its substrates and reducing the phosphorylation of both FAK and its associated proteins. Differential display also revealed the upregulation of another kinase, which had 90% homology with rat MST2 kinase within the 3' UTR. Both mouse MST2 kinase (sequence submitted to GenBank, accession number AY058922) and the closely related family member MST1 kinase were sequenced and cloned. Moreover, evidence to support an autonomously expressed carboxyl-terminal domain of MST2 kinase is presented in Chapter 3 and provides a unique way in which MST2 may regulate its own activity. To further understand the role of MST in neuronal differentiation, a series of stable OLF442 transfections (with mutant and wild-type MST constructs) were carried out. MST was localised with cytoplasmic structures that may represent actin stress fibres, indicating a potential cytoskeletal role during neuronal differentiation. This indicated that MST1 may play a role in the morphological processes involved in neuronal differentiation. The identification of two kinases by differential display provided the motivation to understand the cellular context of OLF442 and to determine the phosphorylation status of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascades. Differentiation of OLF442 induced high-level phosphorylation of a putative B-Raf isoform, MEK2 and ERK1/2. Interestingly, there was a switch between preferential phosphorylation of MEK1 in undifferentiated OLF442 to preferential phosphorylation of MEK2 following differentiation. SAPK/JNK was also phosphorylated, as was the transcription factor c-Jun, which is a common substrate of both the ERK and SAPK/JNK signalling modules. The mapping of the cellular context of differentiating OLF442 has identified a promising model of a novel MAPK module. This consists of FAK signalling through Rap1 to ERK providing sustained activation, which is buffered or terminated by the expression of the endogenous FAK inhibitor FRNK. Furthermore, MST kinase could potentially play a role in regulating the cytoskeletal re-arrangements that are necessary for neuronal differentiation. MST kinase may signal transiently via the SAPK pathway to provide concomitant activation of c-Jun that is required for neuronal differentiation. An understanding of the gene expression pattern of the normal neuronal differentiation program allows a greater understanding of potential developmental aberrations. This could provide an opportunity for therapies to be conceived, while understanding the complexity of neuronal determination could also provide opportunities for stem cell transplantation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neuronal differentiation</field><field name="subject">cell differentiation</field><field name="subject">molecular neuroscience</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">differential gene expression</field><field name="subject">olfactory epithelium</field><field name="subject">kinase</field><field name="subject">kinases</field><field name="subject">stem cell transplantation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040225.161725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nationalism in the Aims and Motivations of the Vietnamese Communist Movement</field><field name="creator">Deane, Alexander</field><field name="description">The Vietnamese people have always harboured an extraordinarily strong patriotic drive.  But the government formed by Ho Chi Minh (1890-1969) after the Declaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) on the 2nd September 1945, the group that was to represent majority Vietnamese opinion until and after 1975, was spearheaded by the Vietminh (League for Vietnam's Independence) - a movement that did not define itself as Nationalist, but rather as an expressly Communist group. When the people of Vietnam looked for leadership, this was the obvious group to choose - the only movement prepared and willing to step in (other, more nationalist resistance groups had prematurely flourished and failed, as shall be discussed). In the Vietnam that found itself suddenly free at the close of the Second World War, no other lobby was ready, no group presented itself nationally as the Communists were and did. The Liberation Army that seized control of town after town was the military arm of the Viet Minh, formed in 1944 under Vo Nguyen Giap (b. 1912), an element of a movement that published its manifesto in February 1930, that had begun preparation and ideological training in the late 1920's in Guangzhou under Ho Chi Minh. Given the long preparation carried out by the Vietminh, the progression to the declaration of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a Communist nation with Ho at its head was a natural one. Whilst that development seems logical given the conditions of the day, the manner in which those conditions were reached (or manipulated) has been the subject of intense debate. Was that natural progression one in which the ideologists of Communist revolution 'captured' the Nationalist movement, exploited a nationalistic fervour to produce the desired revolt, using the front of the Viet Minh to blend their esoteric dogmas with the more easily understood nationalist cause of resistance?  This is a perception held by many modern historians - that, in effect, Communists are the parasites of the modernization process. This attitude was and is encouraged by examination of advice given to Asian revolutionaries by their Soviet counterparts; Grigori Zinoviev (1833-1936) - later to die by Stalin's order - argued in 1922 that Communists should co-operate with the rising nationalists in Asia, gain the leadership of their movement, and then cast aside the genuine national leaders.  For by itself, the tiny Indochina Communist Party could never have hoped to attract the support of politically engaged Vietnamese, let alone the hearts and minds of the nation at large. This is the essence of the currently accepted analysis of the revolutionary Vietnamese setting - that the Communist lobby exploited a majority furious with the abuses of French rule, sliding Communism into a dominant role in Vietnamese life.  The majority of people had not fought for a communist government, but to be rid of the colonial occupying power.  Such a perception, as shall be discussed, is representative of the Western reading of the whole Southeast Asian region of the day. The Vietnamese people were accustomed to the use of violence to protect their independence; perennial opposition to expansionist China meant that few peoples in Asia had been compelled to fight longer and harder to retain their identity as a separate and independent state than the Vietnamese. Whilst the ability and commitment of the Vietcong in resistance to outside power has been recognised, the strong sense of Vietnamese identity in and of itself has never really been acknowledged beyond the most simplistic of terms by external observers, perhaps because of the difficulty of comprehending how such an emotion can form when looking at the odd shape of the nation on a map. Such a lack of awareness allows supposed Vietnam specialists to assert that the dominant Vietnamese self-assessment is the extent to which the country is not Chinese (and, to a lesser extent, not French) rather than entering into a more significant analysis of how a national identity formed: how, whilst certainly influenced by feelings of encirclement and domination, Vietnam also developed a separate, distinct sense of self. This, whilst a sense that has only relatively recently manifested itself in territorial demands, is a longstanding emotion and sense, in and of itself. Given an understanding of that sense or merely an awareness of its existence, the willingness of the Vietnamese to combat the most powerful nation on Earth, though certainly impressive, needs little explanation; this work has attempted to explore a more difficult question -  why they chose the dogma that served them. The idea that the majority of the Vietnamese people had not fought for a communist government, but to be rid of the colonial occupying power is in truth the presentation of a false dichotomy.  The fact that a group within a broad movement participates for different reasons from another group does not necessarily imply exploitation or pretense.  Neither does the fact that one has a strong political ideology such as socialism forbid the possession of any other political inclination, such as patriotism. The concept of a socialist exploitation of Vietnamese nationalism will be opposed here: a discussion of the disputed importance of nationalism to the Vietnamese Communist movement in resistance, and of Communism to the nationalist movement, will form the subject of this essay.  The unity of Vietnam under Communist government in 1975 seems a fitting end to the period to be considered.  Much of interest - the politics behind partition, or the Communist-led conduct of war with America, for example - can be considered only briefly; fortunately, these are issues considered in great depth elsewhere.  The central issue to this work shall be the development of the Communist movement in French Indochina, and the thesis herein shall be that nationalism and Marxist-Leninism occupied a symbiotic relationship in the motivation of the Communist movement and its chief practitioners in the nation once again known as Vietnam.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnamese Communist Movement</field><field name="subject">Ho Chi Minh</field><field name="subject">Viet Minh</field><field name="subject">Vo Nguyen Giap</field><field name="subject">Democratic Republic of Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese identity</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051125.095630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Policy To Practice: A Study of the Queensland Youth Justice Service: Policy, Implementation and Outcomes for Young Offenders</field><field name="creator">Denning, Rebecca</field><field name="description">This thesis employs a broad evaluative framework to examine the impact of the Youth Justice Service (YJS) on the post-intervention offending behaviour of young people on community-based court orders.  The YJS is a Queensland government policy initiative that aims to monitor compliance with community-based court orders, and identify and address causes of criminal behaviour.  The evaluative framework views policy, implementation and impact as distinct but related dimensions of intervention.  Reflecting this framework, three primary research questions are addressed: (1) Does the YJS concept represent a goal-directed, theoretically-informed, executable and assessable juvenile crime prevention policy?, (2) Is the YJS concept realised through service delivery?, and (3) What is the effect of the YJS on future offending behaviour?  Three studies, employing qualitative and quantitative methods, examined these questions. Study one examined the YJS concept, drawing on some key themes from literature on policy development and implementation, developmental and life-course criminology and developmental crime prevention.  This study synthesised key policy and procedure documents around six themes, including (1) rationale, (2) goals, (3) theory, (4) service delivery model, (5) method of operation, and (6) key performance indicators.  Findings indicated that the YJS concept represents only marginal adjustments from the traditional Area Office (AO) model of service delivery, and integrates few new preventative mechanisms that would foreseeably lead to change at the operational level.  Moreover, it suffers from goal ambiguity, fails to incorporate some key components of best-practice crime prevention that have proven successful when working with at-risk young people, lacks sufficient process-level specificity to ensure treatment fidelity, and places heightened importance on measuring impacts that have political value rather than benefits for the clients. In the second study, an in-depth case study of the Logan Area Youth Justice Service (LAYJS) was conducted to explore how the YJS operated in reality, and as compared with the policy directive.  Information was drawn from a variety of sources including interviews with staff and clients, policy and procedure documents, direct observation, case management files and staff-researcher interaction.  Evidence suggested that the LAYJS was focused primarily on ensuring compliance with court orders.  Several organisational factors, such as staff workloads, the statutory basis for monitoring compliance, and the capacities of staff, have meant that comparatively little attention has been directed at addressing offending behaviour.  For the most part, the LAYJS employs an individualised case management process, as distinct from the  collaborative, team-based model that is prescribed in the YJS concept.  Caseworkers have little faith in their ability to bring about positive behavioural change in their clients, and subsequently transferred the responsibility for intervention outcomes to the client.  While acknowledging the importance of families in preventing offending, caseworkers emphasised that a number of organisational tensions have prevented them from engaging families in the case management process. The final study examined the impact of the YJS on post-intervention offending, controlling for developmental risk factors and key features of the intervention process.  A random sample (N=190) of clients from three YJS offices and three AOs was drawn from the population of clients who had active community-based court orders between June 1999 and December 2002.  Information from Department of Communities' case management files and rearrest data from the Queensland Police Service were entered into a purpose-designed database, and analysed using bivariate and multivariate methods including logistic regression and survival analysis.  High proportions of missing data on non-statutory variables suggested poor record management practices, or alternatively that operational staff do not understand the role of developmental risk and/or protective factors and social contexts in preventing offending behaviour.  Results indicated that the YJS was no better than the AO at preventing recidivism, as measured at 18-months post-intervention, even after controlling for risk factors that were significantly related to recidivism.  The analyses found that some unmeasured variation in service delivery, even within service types, did impact upon recidivism, supporting the hypotheses of the first study and the contention that variation in intervention practice can influence offending behaviour.  The likelihood of recidivism was increased if the client was using drugs or was influenced by delinquent peers, and decreased if he stayed in school until years 11 or 12, or where caseworkers addressed familial problems.  This provides some sense of programs that may be appropriate for young offenders in the context of a community-based program.  It also highlights the critical importance of incorporating families into case management, not only for the purpose of providing information, but also as viable targets of intervention. Survival analyses indicated that the YJS might have had some temporary deterrent effect, although this effect had dissipated by 18-months post-intervention.  This result may reflect the increased focus on ensuring compliance with court orders as found in the LAYJS case study.  However, given the hypothesis that the lack of process direction will result in variable practices across offices, it cannot be assumed that all YJSs place equal importance on compliance. Overall, findings suggest that the promise that the YJS would provide an innovative model of service delivery and generate improved outcomes for young offenders has not been realised.  This research has added further weight to the perspective that examines both the individual and combined impact of theory, policy and implementation for measuring client outcomes.  Deficits in any of these components ultimately have a ripple effect, making it difficult to achieve the predetermined goals of the policy at the operational level.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth Justice Service (Queensland)</field><field name="subject">Logan Area Youth Justice Service</field><field name="subject">post-intervention offending behaviour</field><field name="subject">community-based court orders</field><field name="subject">juvenile crime prevention policy</field><field name="subject">future offending behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070112.120302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Constraints in the Search for a Van Der Waals Energy Functional</field><field name="creator">Dinte, Bradley Paul</field><field name="description">In modelling the energetics of molecules and solids, the need for practical electron density functionals that seamlessly include the van der Waals interaction is growing. Such functionals are still in their infancy, and there is yet much experimentation to be performed in the formulation and numerical testing of the requisite approximations. A ground-state density functional approach that uses the exact relations of the adiabatic connection formula and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to obtain the xc energy from the density-density response function seems promising, though a direct local density approximation for the interacting susceptibility will fail to yield the vdW interaction. Significant nonlocality can be built into the interacting susceptibility by screening a 'bare' susceptibility, for which a carefully chosen constraint-obeying local approximation is sufficient to yield a non-trivial van der Waals energy [6]. The constraints of charge conservation, and no response to a constant potential, are guaranteed by expressing the bare susceptibility in terms of the double gradients of a nonlocal bare polarisability. for which it should be easier to make an approximation based on physical principles than it would be for the susceptibility. The 'no-flow' condition is also deemed important. In this work, a simple delta-function approximation for the nonlocal polarisability is fully constrained by a new version of a recently-discovered force theorem (sum rule), requiring the additional input of the independent-electron Kohn-Sham potential. This constrained polarisability cannot be used as input for the seamless vdW scheme, which requires a non-delta-function bare polarisability, and is instead applied to systems containing spherical fragments in a perturbative/asymptotic fashion for calculation of the widely-separated van der Waals interaction. The main thrust of this work is an investigation of the efficacy of the force theorem to constrain simple approximations for response quantities. Many recent perturbative vdW density functionals are based on response functions that are electron-hydrodynamical approximations to the response of the uniform electron gas. These schemes require their response functions to be 'cut off' at low density and high density-gradient, where the approximation overestimates the true response. The imposition of the cut-off is crucial to the success of such schemes. Here, we replace the cut-off with an exact theorem (the force theorem) which naturally 'ties down' the response, based on the potential- and density-functions of the system. This is the first time that the force theorem has been directly applied as a constraint upon a model response function (its original use, by Vignale and Kohn (7), was as an exact identity in time-dependent DFT). Also new in this work is the orbital-by-orbital Kohn-Sham version of the force theorem, and its proof (differing significantly from Vignale's original derivation (8) of the interacting theorem) by directly appealing to the Kohn-Sham orbitals makes its first appearance here. For quantum dots, our constrained response-approximation exactly recovers the net linear dipole response, due mainly to the force theorem's ideal applicability to harmonically confined systems. For angularly-averaged atoms, reasonable static dipole polarisabilities are obtained for the independent-electron Kohn-Sham (bare) case. The results are poor for the fully-interacting case, attributable to the local nature of the approximation. This lends weight to the assertion that it is better to approximate a bare quantity, then screen it, than it is to directly approximate a fully-interacting quantity. Dynamic net polarisabilities constrained by the force theorem are guaranteed to have the correct high-frequency asymptotic convergence to the free electron response. It is seen that the calculated dynamic polarisabilities for atoms are too small at intermediate frequencies, since the calculated vdW C6 coefficients (Hamaker constants) of atomic dimers are up to an order of magnitude too small, even without the use of a low-density cutoff. It is seen that our constrained local model response is non-analytic along the imaginary-frequency axis, and this is very detrimental to the C6 calculations, even though the integrated net polarisability is analytic. Improvement of the polarisability ansatz is indicated, perhaps to a non-deltafunction uniform-gas-based approximation. The use of pseudopotentials may improve the force theorem results, by softening the extreme nature of the bare Coulomb potential.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Van Der Waals</field><field name="subject">energy functional</field><field name="subject">electron density functionals</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050825.154126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and Theoretical Studies of Normal and High Strength Concrete Wall Panels</field><field name="creator">Doh, Jeung-Hwan</field><field name="description">The wall design equations available in major codes of practice (e.g. AS3600 and ACI318) are intended for the design of normal strength concrete load bearing walls supported at top and bottom only. These codes fail to recognise any contribution to load capacity from restraints on the side edges. They also fail to give guidance on the applicability of the equations to high strength concrete. Further, they do not consider slender walls. In many situations walls have side edges restrained and are composed of high strength concrete with high slenderness ratios. The recognition of these factors in the codes would result in thinner walls and consequently savings in construction costs. In this thesis, the focus is on the development of a design formula and new design methods for axially loaded reinforced concrete wall panels. The design of walls having side restraints and being composed of high strength concrete is given particular attention. An experimental program has been undertaken to obtain data for the derivation of applicable formulae and to verify the analytical methods developed herein. Note that, the test results and other data available in published literature have also been used to develop the design formula. The formula encompasses effective length, eccentricity and slenderness ratio factors and is proposed for normal and high strength concrete walls simply supported at top and bottom only (one-way) and simply supported on all four sides (two-way). The major portion of the experimental program focuses on a series of normal and high strength concrete walls simply supported at top and bottom only (one-way), and simply supported on all four sides (two-way) with eccentric axial loading. The behaviour of the test panels is noted, particularly the difference between the normal and high strength concrete panels. A Layer Finite Element Method (LFEM) is used as an analytical tool for walls in two-way action. The LFEM gives comparable results to the test data and the proposed design formula. As part of the research, a program named WASTABT has also been developed to implement a more accurate analytical method involving the instability analysis of two-way action walls. WASTABT is proven to be a useful design tool in situations where the walls have (i) various reinforcement ratio in one or two layers; (ii) composed of normal or high strength concrete; (iii) various eccentricity.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reinforced concrete load bearing walls</field><field name="subject">reinforced concrete load bearing wall panels</field><field name="subject">Layer Finite Element Method</field><field name="subject">engineering design</field><field name="subject">mechanics</field><field name="subject">loads</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030605.114125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sources of Influence on Professional Practice: A Study of Five Women Principals in Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Doherty, Maureen Anne</field><field name="description">Prior to 1989, in New Zealand, very few women were represented in senior leadership positions in schools, especially co-educational secondary schools. Following the 1989 Education Act, commonly referred to as the 'Tomorrow's Schools' legislation, women began to be appointed in increasing numbers to school principalships. In New Zealand, as in other western democracies where New Right ideologies have impacted on educational policy, the role of the school principal has become more demanding and complex. If principals are to be supported in this role, it is considered important that the knowledge and experiences which influence their professional practice are better understood so that professional development programmes are targeted appropriately. This study builds on previous studies of women's experiences of leadership in education (Neville, 1988; Shakeshaft, 1989, 1995; Strachan, 1991, 1997; Court, 1992; Ozga &amp; Walker, 1995; Hall, 1996; Coleman, 1996, 2000; Ah Nee-Benham &amp; Cooper, 1998; Henderson-Kelly &amp; Pamphilon, 2000; McCarthy, 2001; McLay &amp; Brown, 2001) but has as its focus, the sources of influence on five women principals' practice. It has a complementary focus to McLay's and Brown's (2001) study of women headteachers in UK independent secondary schools. They investigated the women's formal training but also sought to find out what life experiences might have prepared them for the role of leading a school. Ah Nee-Benham's and Cooper's (1998) narratives of minority women in school leadership positions in the United States provided the inspiration for this study of five New Zealand principals. While the women in this study are not 'voices from the margins' as are the women in Ah Nee-Benham's and Cooper's study, through the use of narrative and other qualitative methods, their individual accounts capture the voice of experience which is too often missing from the educational leadership literature (Ah Nee-Benham &amp; Cooper, 1998; Heck &amp; Hallinger, 1999; Southworth, 2001). The women's stories add collectively to an emerging literature base which seeks to unravel how leaders actually think and work. This study specifically examines five women principals' personal theories and beliefs about leadership and investigates how their personal histories and career experiences have influenced their professional knowledge and practice. The research methods reflect a commitment to understanding the women's experiences from their perspectives and their stories are seen as providing a window into what they know. Methods such as concept mapping, open-ended unstructured interviews and annals (snake diagrams) help unpack their personal theories about leadership as well as assist understanding of the influence of their personal histories and professional experiences. The educational leadership literature provides a useful starting point to analyse the first part of the research question regarding the women's conceptions of leadership. The literature acknowledges various approaches to leadership, three of which may be called 'moral/critical', 'people-centred' and 'corporate managerial'. Respectively, they each have 'world-views' which emphasise 'ideals', 'people' and 'efficiency'. In this study, I aim to identify what 'world-views' underpin the women's conceptions of leadership but also how they have constructed these concepts. The different needs of each of their schools in association with the principals' own backgrounds and values systems have strongly influenced their varying conceptions of leadership. While on one level their beliefs are unique, on another, they reveal some common themes. The principals are people-focussed but this commitment is underpinned by deeply held ideals about the purpose of schools enriching lives. Efficient management systems are seen as important supporting concepts to assisting people and accomplishing ideals. In order to answer the second part of the research question regarding how the women's personal histories and professional experiences have influenced their professional knowledge and practice, this study drew on the findings of an Australian study which investigated the sources of influence on teacher knowledge in action (McMeniman, Cumming, Wilson, Stevenson &amp; Sim, 2000). It provided the platform and focus for the current study of women principals. A key finding of this study is that the women's beliefs and practices have been influenced by both their personal histories and various career experiences which have assisted them to grow professionally. Central to their learning from these experiences, however, is the way in which the individual interprets or filters experience and actively constructs meaning. Principals' knowledge bases are socially constructed but mediated by their personal theories. Learning from experiences in the workplace has a critical influence especially if it is scaffolded by experts (Billett, 2001) or if there is a community of practice (Wenger, 1998, 2000) encouraging participation. When this learning is augmented by various research access points (McMeniman et al., 2000) such as critical dialogue with peers, in-service education and formal postgraduate studies, it potentially has a direct and daily influence on principals' practice. Although this study is limited to an analysis of five women principals, the commonalities in the sources of influence on their practice, lead one to suggest that the findings may have relevance for other principals, both male and female, and possibly other practitioners.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">professional practice</field><field name="subject">women principals</field><field name="subject">educational leadership</field><field name="subject">influences on practice</field><field name="subject">leadership concepts</field><field name="subject">learning from experience</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030806.121232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovation in Education in 'Designated Character Schools': a Case Study of the Directors of Discovery 1 and 'Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti'</field><field name="creator">Doig, Cheryl</field><field name="description">This dissertation is a case study into participant perceptions of innovation in education. The participants in this research were four directors from two 'designated character' schools, which were set up to be foundationally different from traditional schools through opportunities to explore radical innovation. That is, both schools were conceptualised as sites for exploring radical rather than incremental change. The central questions asked in this study were - what makes for radical innovation in schools; and how is the use of ICT implicated in innovation in schools? The literature review indicated that while there has been an increase in the information regarding innovation in education there has been little research into how this was being developed in non-traditional settings, or in ways that were radical. The role of ICTs in developing innovation was also reviewed, given that the two 'designated character' schools being studied had strong support for ICTs. The main aims of this study were: to identify the features of radical innovation in schools; to explore the barriers against, and drivers for, innovation in schools; to provide insight into the use of ICTs to influence innovation in schools; to contribute to the literature regarding innovation in schools; and to identify future opportunities to innovate. This study was a qualitative one, with symbolic interactionism as its theoretical underpinning. Data were gathered through the use of concept mapping, interviews and a focus group activity. The findings of the study were that radical innovation in schools occurs when there is a cultural shift in the whole notion of schooling. This is difficult to achieve, even for schools that have been set up to be foundationally different. However, such schools can provide examples of some innovative practices that are 'greenfields'. The use of ICTs, while not required for innovation, helps schools create innovative ideas, especially those ideas based around the needs of individual learners. There is a greater chance that this will lead to innovation being sustained. These findings have implications for policy makers to allow schools that are more innovative to try new ideas and to be supported to do so.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Innovation in education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand schools</field><field name="subject">designated character schools</field><field name="subject">education (New Zealand)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060220.170614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Gods Project: Drama as Intercultural Education. An Ethnographic Study of an Intercultural Performance Project in a Secondary School</field><field name="creator">Donelan, Katriona Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the role of drama in the intercultural education of young people. It considers the relationship between the fields of drama education, intercultural performance and ethnography. The drama curriculum is explored as a site of intercultural learning and performance pedagogy. The thesis also examines the place of ethnography as an embodied, participatory practice in intercultural drama pedagogy and performance research. The study is placed in a context of international exchange and cultural pluralism, and is framed by debates about intercultural performance and the appropriation and representation of cultural narratives. This investigation of interculturalism within the drama curriculum is grounded in an ethnographic study conducted in Melbourne, Australia in a multicultural secondary school community. The study documents the experiences of approximately forty young people who participated in an African drama and performing arts project called &#145;The Gods Project&#146;. &#145;Jean&#146;, a Kenyan performing artist who was undertaking a two-year residency in the school, led the intercultural performance project. Participants were involved in drama and performing arts workshops, an &#145;African&#146; creative arts camp and a performance of a play, The Gods are not to Blame, by Nigerian playwright Ola Rotimi. The interpretative account of the project draws on ethnographic data from the first year of Jean&#146;s residency in the school and six months of intensive fieldwork in the second year of her residency. It also includes longitudinal data that was collected from a group of participants up to four years after the project. I collaborated with Jean and with a group of senior students, who volunteered to be &#145;student co-researchers&#146;, to record and analyse the diverse experiences of participants in The Gods Project and to interpret its educational, social, and aesthetic impact within the school context. Jean&#146;s pedagogy of intercultural story telling within the drama classroom and her role as a &#145;cultural guide&#146; throughout the project was explored. As a participatory ethnographic researcher, drama educator and &#145;assistant director&#146;, I worked alongside Jean and the students as they played with, talked about, resisted, created, adapted, subverted, embodied and performed intercultural performance texts. Drawing on Turner (1982) and Schechner (1988), I conceptualised The Gods Project as an intersecting social and aesthetic drama. The phases of &#145;social drama&#146; and ritual were used as a framework for the data analysis and as a structure for the narrative account of the project. Turner&#146;s concepts of the &#145;liminal/liminoid&#146; and &#145;communitas&#146; were applied to the participants&#146; experiences at the creative arts camp and within the workshop and performance space. &#145;Dark play&#146; was identified as the young people&#146;s response to the difficult social drama they were involved in; their subversive play provided a way to engage with the &#145;strangeness&#146; of the cultural material and the play&#146;s &#145;dark&#146; story and themes. The participants&#146; dramatic play informed the emerging aesthetic drama and facilitated their intercultural meaning making. The students&#146; efforts to make sense of and interpret a performance text embedded in a Yoruba context resemble the task of an ethnographer attempting to understand and represent socio-cultural experiences. The study demonstrates that through a process of collaborative &#145;intercultural reflexivity&#146;, ethnography can enhance intercultural drama education. The pedagogical features of The Gods Project are related to Turner&#146;s concept of performance ethnography and the role of a &#145;cultural guide&#146; in intercultural teaching and learning is highlighted. With the guidance of their Kenyan teaching artist many of the young people engaged with different socio-cultural perspectives, actively explored new cultural performance conventions and art forms, and experienced the complexities of intercultural representation. The study reveals evidence of significant social, personal, intercultural and artistic learning outcomes for participants within this school-based performance project. However, the study also reveals the difficulties and challenges of implementing an innovative intercultural project within a school context. It demonstrates that kinaesthetic, playful, embodied and performative experiences are central to intercultural teaching and learning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drama in intercultural education</field><field name="subject">interculturalism</field><field name="subject">drama curriculum</field><field name="subject">intercultural storytelling</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060609.111246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourses for the New Millennium: Exploring the Cultural Models of 'Y Generation' Preservice Teachers</field><field name="creator">Donnison, Sharn</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the cultural models and discourses that a group of aspiring, primary school teachers in South-East Queensland employed to explain their current world and describe the likely development of their own careers and lives. Thirteen males and fifty-seven females, aged between 15 and 25, were involved in the study. All participants had expressed an interest in preservice teacher training with 77 percent of the cohort currently enrolled in a teacher-training program in the South-East region of Queensland, Australia. This study adopted a multi-method approach to data collection and included informal interviews, scenario planning workshops, focus groups, and a telephone survey. Initial pilot studies, incorporating informal interviews, preceded scenario planning workshops. Four males and eleven females were involved in six scenario planning groups. The scenario planning format, based upon Schwartz (1991), followed a seven-step approach whereby participants formulated and evaluated four possible future scenarios for Australia. These formed the stimulus material for the second stage of the study where thirteen focus groups critically analysed the scenario planning data. Interpretation of the data was underpinned by a framework based on an amalgamation of Gee's (1999) theoretical concepts of acts of meaning, cultural models, and Discourses and Bernstein's (1996) theoretical concepts of classification, framing, and realisation and recognition rules. The respondents exhibited five pre-eminent Discourses. These were a Technologies Discourse, Educational Discourse, Success Discourse, Voyeuristic Discourse, and an Oppositional Discourse. The group's Technologies Discourse was pervasive and influenced their future predictions for Australian society, themselves, and education and was expressed in both positive and negative terms. The respondents spoke of their current and future relationship to technologies in positive terms while they spoke of society's future relationship to technologies in negative terms. Their reactions to technologies were appropriated from two specific cultural resources. In the first instance this appears to be from their personal positive interactions with technologies. In the second instance the group have drawn from Science Fiction Discourses to predict malevolent and controlling technologies of the future. The respondents' Technologies Discourse is also evident in their Educational Discourse. They predict that their future classrooms will be more technological and that they, as teaching professionals, will be technologically literate and proficient. Their past experiences with education and schooling systems has also influenced their Educational Discourse and led them to assume, paradoxically, that while the process of education is and will continue to be a force for change, schools will not evidence a great deal of change in the coming years. The respondents were optimistic and confident about themselves, their current interactions with technologies, their future lives, and their future careers. These dispositions formed part of their Success Discourse and manifested as heroism, idealism, and a belief in utopian personal futures. The respondents' Voyeuristic Discourse assumed limited social engagement and a limited ability to accept responsibility for the past, present, and future. The respondents had adopted an 'onlooker' approach to society. This aspect of their Discourse appeared to be mutable and showed signs of tempering as the respondents matured and became more involved in their teaching careers. Finally, the respondents' Oppositional Discourse clearly delineated between themselves and 'others'. They were users of technologies, teachers, good people, young, privileged, white, Australian, and urban dwelling while 'others' were controllers of technologies, learners, bad people, older or younger, non-privileged, non-Australian, and country dwelling. Current reforms introduced by Education Queensland have stressed the need for a new approach to new times, new economies, and new workplaces. This involves having a capacity to envisage new forms, new structures, and new relationships. 'New times' teaching professionals are change agents who are socially critical, socially responsible, risk takers, able to negotiate a constantly changing knowledge-rich society, flexible, creative, innovative, reflexive, and collaborative (Sachs, 2003). The respondents in this study did not appear to be change agents or future activist teaching professionals (Sachs, 2003). Rather, they were inclined towards reproducing historical, traditional, and conservative social and professional roles as well as practices, and maintaining a safe distance from social and environmental responsibility. Essentially, the group had responded to a period of rapid social and cultural change by placing themselves outside of change forces. Successful educational reform and implementation, such as that being proposed by Education Queensland (2000), demands that all interested stakeholders share a common vision (Fullan, 1993). The respondents' Discourses indicated that they did not exhibit a futures vision beyond their immediate selves. This limited vision was at odds with that being espoused by Education Queensland (2000). This body recognises the importance of being able to envisage, develop, and sustain preferable futures visions and have developed futures oriented curricula with this in mind. Such curricula are said to respond to the changing needs of today's and tomorrow's society by having problem solving and the concept of lifelong learning at the core. The future towards which the respondents aspire is one where lifelong learning and problem solving have little significance beyond their need to stay current with evolving technologies. In reflecting on the respondents' viewpoints and the range of Discourses that they draw upon to accommodate their changing world, I propose a number of recommendations for policy makers and educators. It is recommended that preservice teacher training institutions take up the challenge of equipping future teachers with the skills, knowledges, and dispositions needed to be responsible, reflective, and proactive educators who are able to envisage and work towards preferable visions of schooling and society. Ideally, this could occur through mandatory Futures Studies courses. Currently, Futures Studies courses are not seen as an essential area of study within education degrees and as such preservice teachers are given little opportunity to engage with futures concepts, knowledges, or skills. The success of the scenario planning approach in this thesis and the richness of the issues raised through interactive engagement in imagining possible futures, suggests that all citizens, but particularly teachers, need to enlighten their imaginations more often through such processes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teacher attributes</field><field name="subject">teacher training (Queensland)</field><field name="subject">vocational selection</field><field name="subject">technologies discourse</field><field name="subject">educational discourse</field><field name="subject">success discourse</field><field name="subject">voyeuristic discourse</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061012.154401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In a nutshell, it's the very basics: remote area nurses' constructions of primary health care</field><field name="creator">Donovan, Anne</field><field name="description">This study explores the constructions of primary health care held by remote area nurses working in indigenous communities without resident medical practitioners, in the Northern Territory. Primary health care is increasingly permeating health policy in Australia, and nurses in remote areas are responsible for its implementation. The study investigates past and present discussions of the meaning of the concept of primary health care to begin to identify the major forces which have problematically impacted on its evolution and interpretation. It traces the threads which emerge from these forces through the more recent developments of health promotion and new pubflc health to explore the discourses and strategies they have produced, and which overtly and covertly influence the implementation of primary health care. Remote area nurses are individually interviewed and their discussions analysed to explore the constructions of primary health care which they hold. The analysis also explores some of the ways in which these constructions may have come to exist, the evident impact of current discourses, and the absence of effective support in the further development of these constructions. The remote area nurses' discussions display a view of primary health care as the most basic of health services, focussed on personal hygiene and the individual's responsibility in prevention of illness, operated through encounters which offer opportunities for education and basic curative care. While several of the nurses indicate discomfort with the paternalistic nature of such a service, none are aware of ways in which they might resolve their concerns about it. The study briefly explores positive approaches towards the democratization of health care, and examines the support needed by remote area nurses if primary health care is to be effectively implemented by them.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Remote area nursing</field><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050901.104302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adapting to Diversity: Pedagogy for Taiwanese students in mainstream Australian secondary school classes</field><field name="creator">Dooley, Karen Teresa</field><field name="description">This study investigated pedagogy for Taiwanese students in mainstream Australian secondary school classes.  The aim was to explore the construction of pedagogy for these students within the communicative contingencies of both the classroom and the community of talk around the classroom.  Accordingly, the study documented and explicated the ways in which teachers adapted geography lessons for Taiwanese students, and further, the fit of teachers' descriptions and explanations of those adaptations within broader school community debate over provision for ethnic minority students.  The significance of the study resides in its contribution to educational research, policy and practice in conditions of cultural diversity and formal cultural inclusion. The study's contributions arise from its attention to the forms of teacher-student interaction that are often considered to be a major point of difference between pedagogy in Australia (and other Western nations) and in Chinese (and other Asian) contexts.  The focus is on the degree of teacher-directedness or student-centredness, as demonstrated by such factors as rote learning and participation in whole class spoken activities.  Review of the current literature indicated that such dispositions may not only be brought to Australian pedagogic contexts by Chinese students, but may also be constructed within these contexts themselves.  Analysis of theoretical perspectives on culture and pedagogy that were of high profile in Australia during the 1990s indicated that the investigation of this possibility requires an approach that makes it possible to attend to the structuring of such contexts.  Accordingly, this study was conducted from a perspective that made it possible to document and explicate the construction of socialising conditions within the communicative particularities of lessons for Taiwanese students as pedagogic practice enacted in classrooms, and of debate amongst those interested in the education of the students as pedagogic talk within a school community. The theoretical framework of the study drew primarily on Basil Bernstein's sociology of educational knowledge.  This perspective provided the fundamental concepts for describing the categorisation of Taiwanese students in the teacher-student interaction of the classroom and in school community talk about such.  Analytic concepts developed by researchers concerned with classroom talk were specified in Bernsteinian terms to facilitate the translation between these theoretical objects and the sets of lesson and interview data examined in the study.  These concepts made it possible to describe the pedagogic activities of teachers and students, and their constituent social actions, as enacted in the lessons, and as constructed in the interview talk of school community members.  The two data sets were produced and analysed by methods derived from the Bernsteinian perspective.  The aim was to: i) test the generic and formal Bernsteinian sociology of educational knowledge; and ii) produce findings generalisable to culturally diverse Australian school settings. One of the main findings of the study was that the adaptation of geography lessons for Taiwanese, Chinese, Asian and other ESL students produced a more constrained and teacher-directed form of pedagogy than that which was provided for other students.  The other main finding was that the geography teachers described and explained these adaptations by categorising the students as 'reluctant' in whole class spoken activities and 'dependent' in written seatwork activities.  Other school community members interested in the education of Taiwanese students evinced substantial agreement in this regard.  However, these interviewees constructed the 'reluctant' speech and 'dependent' seatwork of the students from complex collaborative and competitive positions available in professional-academic talk.  This pointed to struggles amongst those who would inform the provision of pedagogy for Taiwanese and other Chinese, Asian and ESL students. The study's theoretical significance resides, in part, in its capacity to describe the moment-by-moment classroom interaction of Taiwanese students without pre-empting the empirical salience of categories of cultural identity.  Rather, attention is focused on the ways that students are categorised according to their capacity to undertake particular communicative interactions, categorisations in which cultural identity is not necessarily made overtly salient.  In this way the study refined and tested the Bernsteinian model of classroom practice, while also locating analytic tools for describing classroom talk within broader relations of social power and control.  Methodologically, the study's significance arises from its capacity to generate descriptions of the particularity of classroom practice, and talk about such, as pedagogic practice and talk.  For policymakers the study points to the professional-academic discourses that need to be made available to teachers if they are to engage in the conversations about pedagogy that are central to emergent, second-wave conceptions of cultural equity in the state of Queensland where the study was conducted.  For practitioners questions arise from the possibility that the dispositions of Taiwanese and other Chinese, Asian and ESL students to teacher-directed forms of pedagogy may be constructed in Australian contexts.  These pertain to the desirability of the outcomes of adaptations undertaken in the name of cultural equity, in addition to the implications of teachers' own professional-academic socialisation for debates over 'who' should get 'what' pedagogic provision.  The thesis concludes with a discussion of the utility of the study's perspective and findings given current developments in the racial and cultural politics of Australian educational institutions.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cultural equity</field><field name="subject">classroom discourse</field><field name="subject">sociology of pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Taiwanese</field><field name="subject">educational sociology</field><field name="subject">educational equalization</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030102.105906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultivating the [New] Country: Disclosing Through Curatorship the Cultural and Economic Development Potential of the Australian Regional Art Museum</field><field name="creator">Douglas, Craig Cameron</field><field name="description">This study utilising a 'theory into practice' methodology, interrogates the phenomena of the Australian Regional Art Museum and establishes that curatorship, as a defined visual art practice can sustain the art museum as a viable cultural institution in contemporary regional Australia.

The coach-athlete relationship is one of the most important influences on athlete's motivation and performance (Mageau &amp; Vallerand, 2003).  One of the key leadership roles the coach has in this relationship is the creation and maintenance of the sports class learning climate. The joint influence of the athlete's motivation and the environmental press (class learning climate) can determine the cognitive, affective, and performance patterns regularly displayed by athletes (Ntoumanis &amp; Biddle, 1999).  A sports class' learning climate is a set of internal characteristics that has an important role in shaping an athlete's motivational and behavioural pattern (Ames, 1992) and is a key characteristic of class effectiveness. In sports classes, motivational climate is a sub-set of the overall learning climate and is created primarily by the sport class coach. Motivational climate can be described as the participants' relatively persistent collective perceptions of the achievement goal structure of that setting.  Recent studies of motivational climate in sport have provided insight into coaching behaviour and its effect on sports class motivational climate (Ntoumanis &amp; Biddle, 1999).  In spite of the potential value of class learning climate research to the field of sports class behavioural studies, no research has consolidated the fields of classroom learning climate research and sports class motivational climate studies. This study provides a model for the investigation of gymnastics sports class learning climates that involves a consolidation of the dimensions and items of the Perceived Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire-2 (Newton, Duda, &amp; Yin, 2000) and the Classroom Environment Scale (Moos &amp; Trickett, 1987).  The development and validation of a new, unique learning climate scale - the Sports Class Environment Scale (SCES) - constitutes the focus of this research.  The process of developing this consolidated instrument began with the production of an initial scale, and was followed by a review by a panel of experts in coaching and independent university researchers in sport and physical education.  The SCES draft was then pilot tested with a small group (n = 41) of competitive gymnasts to prompt some changes to the scale. Initial field-testing of the SCES occurred with 28 male and 180 female competitive gymnasts from 6 metropolitan and 4 regional competitive gymnastics clubs in Queensland, Australia. Exploratory factor analysis provided a revised SCES with five subscales labeled Task Involvement and Improvement, Ego Involvement and Mistakes, Coach-Athlete Communication, Effort, Order and Organization, and Affiliation. Using the revised SCES subscales as dependent variables, multivariate analyses of variance were conducted to compare club type, gender, and competitive level. In this study, the low training hours and the high training hours gymnastics classes were different in their perceptions of the Ego Involvement of their class climate. Male and female gymnasts were different in their perceptions of Ego Involvement, Affiliation, and Effort, Order and Organization aspects of their class climates. This study demonstrates the potential utility of creating class learning climates high in both Task Involvement and Ego Involvement for competitive gymnastics clubs.  This study breaks new ground, and may lead to novel insights into sports class learning climates. Because class learning climate is easier to manipulate than individual achievement goal dispositions (Whitehead, Andree, &amp; Lee, 1997) and because perceptions of learning climate account for variance in learning outcomes beyond that attributable to student ability (Fraser, 1994, 1998, 2002), class learning climate is an important variable that should be better understood, described, developed, and manipulated. Effective measurement of sports class learning climates using the SCES may lead to a greater understanding of effective sports classes, and of coach and athlete behaviours in those classes, and provides a first step in monitoring sports class learning climates.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sports Class Learning Climates</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Sports Skill</field><field name="subject">Coach-athlete Relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071217.121601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Worker in Catholic Social Thought: An Historical Analysis</field><field name="creator">Duffy, Gavan James</field><field name="description">This thesis examines directly the development of Catholic social teaching in respect of the rights and duties of the worker. Beginning with the Old Testament, the thesis compares the attitude of the Hebrew people as expressed in Scripture to those who performed the tasks associated with the crafts or with labour.  This shows how the attitude of the Hebrews to workers, in comparison with the attitude of surrounding peoples, was ameliorated by their belief in a just God who spoke to them in Scripture and through the prophets.  In its examination of the New Testament, the thesis extracts gospel references to the worker and extracts from the Epistles, particularly from the Pauline texts, on the subject.  The changes in attitude to the worker as expressed in the New and Old Testaments are noted. Next examined are the writings of the Church Fathers and their application to the worker.  It can be seen from this examination that the early Church Fathers, whilst not directly developing a body of teaching in respect of the worker, developed a philosophical platform for its later development.  It will be shown how the teachings of the Church Fathers, in their application of teaching of Jesus in the Gospels to the prevailing attitudes of Roman society contributed to the further amelioration of the condition of slaves in the later Empire.  When speaking of the worker in Greco-Roman society, one is in effect speaking about the institution of slavery. The thesis then discusses the further changes in attitude to the worker that followed the decline of imperial authority in the west.  It examines the role of the Church and its teaching regarding the dignity of the human person and the place of work in the scheme of redemption, and how it had an ameliorating effect on the treatment of slaves in the various Barbarian kingdoms which arose in the west following the extinguishing of Roman authority. The thesis argues that it was the influence of Christianity which ultimately led to the evolution of the condition of slavery as it was known in the Roman Empire and Carolingian period, to that of the serfdom of the Middle Ages. Next discussed is the 'Guild System' of regulating and controlling the crafts.  The Guilds were a society, in part co-operative but mainly composed of private owners of capital whose corporation was self governing, and was designed to check competition between its members in order to prevent the growth of one at the expense of the other. The thesis examines how the Guilds functioned and explains why some Catholic writers such as Hilaire Belloc and Gilbert Keith Chesterton regarded the Guilds as an excellent example of the practical application of Christian principles to work and economics. The thesis then examines the effects of the Reformation and the rise of liberal capitalism from the Guild system and how they both contributed to its decline.  Following the decline of the Guild system and the onset of liberal capitalism, society came to be divided into two classes, the capitalist class, and the proletariat.  This thesis examines how this development occurred and the factors which contributed to it.  It shows how the division of society into capitalist and proletariat, haves and have-nots, resulted in the development of a class war and the antagonism between capital and labour.  The thesis shows how under the liberal capitalist system, the conditions of the working class came to resemble in the words of Leo XIII, 'a yoke, almost of slavery'. Next developed and analysed is the manner in which the antinomy between capital and labour gave birth to the philosophy of Marxism in 1848 following the publication of the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Freidrich Engels.  It shows how the development of these two antagonistic classes was viewed by the Church as an aberration or distortion of the social order and how in response to the rise of the philosophy of Marxism, Leo XIII countered with his great social encyclical Rerum Novarum, promulgated on the 15th May 1891, which was to earn him the title of 'The Workers' Pope'. The thesis then deals sequentially with the social teachings and encyclicals of Popes Pius XI, Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI and John Paul II.  All of these Popes, in some way, expanded upon and developed the social teaching of the Church regarding the workers.   In many ways it could be said that the later encyclicals have 'fleshed out' Rerum Novarum.  During this period, numerous advances have been made in the fields of technology and there has been a considerable improvement in the conditions and wages of workers.  In its consideration of the social encyclicals since Rerum Novarum, this thesis discusses the way in which the Popes have developed and expanded Catholic social teaching in respect of the workers as changes in technology and various structural changes to the financial system threw up new and complex challenges to the creation of a just social order in which the dignity and the rights of workers are fully respected. It is shown how the Popes since Leo XIII have confronted the injustices associated with these developments and detailed recommendations for action, some of which would be viewed by many as quite radical. Later in this thesis deleterious effects upon the rights of workers of global neo-liberal capitalism are identified.  It is demonstrated that in the early years of the twenty-first century, there are already signs that some of the less desirable traits of laissez faire or liberal capitalism, are once again rearing their heads.  This is seen in such developments as the 'hollowing out' of the middle class and the concentration of wealth in fewer hands.  It is also seen in the slow but sure erosion of the working conditions of workers and in their level of remuneration.  It is seen in developed countries, in the trend towards longer working hours and the increasing casualisation of the workforce. This thesis shows that in the context of the world economy, a gap continues to widen between the developed and undeveloped nations, whilst inequitable trade agreements tend to confine the developing nations to the status of providers of raw materials to the industrialised world, an inequity, which, more often than not finds itself imposed upon the working men and women of the developing nations in the form of long hours, low wages and poor conditions. It is a tenet of this thesis that the social teaching of the Church directly the challenges and confronts the philosophy of neo-liberal capitalism and its associated philosophy of globalism in respect of the attaining of a just distribution of the world's goods, the dignity of work and the mutual dependence of capital and labour.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic social teaching</field><field name="subject">slavery</field><field name="subject">serfdom</field><field name="subject">capital and labour</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070719.100813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Genetic and Social Mating System of a White-Backed Population of the Australian Magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen tyrannica)</field><field name="creator">Durrant, Kate</field><field name="description">The Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) is a large, sedentary, omnivorous passerine.  In some populations, individuals live in groups, and some of these groups breed cooperatively.  The white-backed magpie (G. t. tyrannica) from the south-eastern corner of the continent, has had relatively little study, and few details are known of its mating system, social structure, and method of parental care.  I conducted an observational study on a population of white-backed magpies, recording details of their demography, dispersal, breeding system, and parental care.  In conjunction, I conducted a genetic analysis of the population, to determine if the genetic mating system matched the observed social system, to detect instances of extra-group mating, and to sex juvenile birds. Extra-pair paternity (EPP) is a common feature of the mating systems of many birds.  The rate of EPP may vary between species, races and populations.  I made a comparison of extra-group paternity (EGP) rates between two races of the Australian magpie, to determine if similar mating systems were being employed.  The two populations had similar social structure, but differed in group size and dispersal.  I predicted that dispersal differences would have a profound effect on the rate of EGP between the populations, as the population with the lower rate of dispersal and higher chance of breeding with a close relative would engage in EGPs more frequently.  Eight microsatellite loci were used to determine parentage in the white-backed Australian magpie.  The rate of EGP was found to be 44%.  Dispersal rates were estimated from observational data.  Over half of the juvenile magpie cohort from the previous breeding season leave the territorial group.  These results contrast sharply with the results found by other researchers in a population of western Australian magpies (G t. dorsalis).  In this population, 82% EGP is recorded and dispersal of juveniles is close to nil.  The results indicate that dispersal rate is a potentially important predictor of rates of extra-group fertilisations between populations of this species, and suggest that females maximise their reproductive output by avoiding breeding with close kin. The reproductive success of a male bird is often correlated with measurable traits that predict his intrinsic quality.  Females are thought to select mates based on their quality to gain their 'good genes'.  Male Australian magpies of the white-backed race were trapped in two breeding seasons.  Measurements were taken of morphometric and other characteristics in order to discover whether particular traits of males were associated with: a) number of fledglings produced in the territory per season; b) percentage of offspring sired in the territory; and c) whether females select males for their 'good genes'.  The only variable that was correlated with number of territorial offspring was feather lice load.  Males with high numbers of lice were less likely to produce territorial fledglings in one season and across both seasons.  Males of inferior quality may be subject to increased conspecific territorial intrusions, leading to more time spent on defence, more failed breeding attempts, less time allocated to grooming and thus high parasite loads.  Males that produced many territorial fledglings were more likely to gain genetic paternity of at least some of them, although again this was significant for only one season.  Also, across both seasons, a high number of females in the group was correlated with increased paternity within the group.  The general lack of correlation between the variables and level of genetic paternity may be due to females engaging in extra-group mating primarily to avoid breeding with a close relative rather than to choose a quality male.  In this scenario, males would not have to be 'high quality', but merely genetically different to the female's social mate. Extra-group paternity (EGP) can affect paternal effort.  It may also influence the helping effort of auxiliary birds in cooperatively breeding species.  If helping is driven by kin selection, helpers should decline to provision unrelated young.  Relatedness becomes difficult to assess however, when females mate outside the group.  Alternative rewards may then become important in helper decisions.  In my study population of Australian magpies, 38% of fledglings were sired by males outside the territorial group.  In a second population (G. t. dorsalis), 82% of fledglings were sired by extra-group males.  I observed within-group male and helper feeding effort over three breeding seasons in the first population and obtained data recorded over a single season in the second population.  In both populations, males provisioned young regardless of relatedness, as did helpers.  Males provisioned less than the nesting female on average.  Paternal effort did not reduce with an increase in the rate of EGP between populations.  In the population with intermediate levels of EGP, the white-backed magpies, I observed helpers in about half of the sampled territories that produced fledglings.  Helpers did not increase the production of young.  In the population with high levels of EGP, western magpies, I detected helping behaviour in proportionally more territories.  It appears that Australian magpie helpers provide help in order to pay 'rent' and remain on the natal territory.  I discuss these results in light of the differences between the two races of magpie and the major theories regarding male parenting decisions and helper activity. Finally, I examine the relatively high rates of EGP's in the Australian magpie from a phylogenetic perspective.  Although inbreeding avoidance is strongly supported by this study as the major reason EGP is so common in magpie populations, there may be an element of phylogenetic inertia that maintains the frequency of this behavioural trait.  I comment upon the use of single-population estimates of species EGP rates in comparative analyses, given the intraspecific variation discovered between Australian magpie populations.  Future directions for the study of mate choice in the Australian magpie are outlined with a proposal to study variation at the major histocompatibility complex between mated pairs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">magpie</field><field name="subject">magpies</field><field name="subject">white-backed</field><field name="subject">Gymnorhina tibicen tyrannica</field><field name="subject">mating</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">cooperative</field><field name="subject">group</field><field name="subject">groups</field><field name="subject">mate selection</field><field name="subject">extra-pair paternity</field><field name="subject">EPP</field><field name="subject">extra-group paternity</field><field name="subject">EGP</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040716.093636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Serotonin as a Mediator of Fatigue During Exercise and Training</field><field name="creator">Dwyer, Daniel</field><field name="description">Exercise has been shown to cause an increase in the concentration of brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in humans and experimental animals. The increase in brain serotonin coincides with the onset of fatigue and is referred to as "central fatigue". Experiments in humans and animals involving serotonin receptor agonists have demonstrated reductions in exercise performance by simulating the exercise-induced increase in endogenous serotonin. Conversely, the administration of serotonin receptor antagonists has been shown to extend exercise performance in experimental animals, but not in humans. Although the relationship between the concentration of brain serotonin and exercise performance is well described in the literature, the precise effect of central fatigue on muscle function per se is unclear. Furthermore, there appear to be differences in serotonergic function between trained and untrained cohorts. However, it is not clear whether the differences are due to a training adaptation or if the differences are inherent in the individual. In addition, the time course of these adaptations and the mechanisms of adaptation are not known.  The initial purpose of this thesis was to determine whether six weeks of endurance exercise training had any effect on central serotonin receptor sensitivity in Wistar rats. The rats ran on a treadmill 4 times per week with 2 exercise tests of endurance performance per week. Receptor sensitivity was determined indirectly, at the end of each training week, by the reduction in endurance performance, under the influence of a 5-HT1a agonist, (m-Chlorophenylpiperazine, m-CPP). Improved tolerance to the fatiguing effects of the serotonin agonist would suggest desensitisation of central serotonin receptors, probably 5-HT1a receptors. Two groups of controls were used to examine, i) the effect of the injection per se on exercise performance and ii) changes in serotonin receptor sensitivity associated with maturation, in the absence of any exercise training. In the training group, undrugged exercise performance significantly improved by 47% after 6 weeks of training (mean &#177; SEM,  4518 &#177; 729 s vs. 6640 &#177; 903 s, p=0.01). Drugged exercise performance also increased significantly from week 1 to week 6 (306 &#177; 69 s to 712 &#177; 192 s, p=0.004). Control group results indicated that the dose of m-CPP alone caused fatigue during exercise tests and that maturation was not responsible for any decrease in receptor sensitivity. Endurance training appears to stimulate an adaptive response to the fatiguing effects of increased brain serotonin, which may enhance endurance exercise performance.  The purpose of the second set of experiments described in this thesis was to investigate changes in serotonin receptor sensitivity in response to exercise training in human subjects. Twelve male volunteers completed 30 minutes of stationary cycling at 70% of VO2peak, on 3 days per week, for 9 weeks. Serotonin receptor sensitivity was assessed indirectly by measuring the prolactin response to a serotonin receptor agonist (buspirone hydrochloride), using a placebo controlled, blind cross-over design. A sedentary group of control subjects were also recruited to control for possible seasonal variations in serotonin receptor sensitivity. Endurance capacity was also assessed as time to exhaustion while cycling at 60% of VO2peak. The exercise training caused a significant increase in aerobic power (VO2peak, 3.1&#177;0.16 to 3.6&#177;0.15 L.m-1, p&lt; 0.05) and endurance capacity (93&#177;8 to 168&#177;11 min, p&lt;0.05), but there was no change (p&gt;0.05) in the prolactin response to a serotonin agonist. However, 25% of the subjects in the training group demonstrated a decrease in receptor sensitivity, as indicated by a decrease in prolactin response. These results suggest that while the exercise training caused an increase in aerobic power and endurance capacity, there was no measurable change in 5-HT receptor sensitivity. In addition, it is possible that changes in receptor sensitivity may take longer to occur, the training stimulus used in the present investigation was inadequate or that changes occurred in other 5-HT receptor subtypes that were not assessed by the present methodology.  The third set of experiments described here, investigated the changes in neuromuscular function under the influence of a serotonin receptor agonist (buspirone hydrochloride). Subjects were administered the agonist or a placebo in a blind cross over design. Measures of neuromuscular function included reaction time (RT), hand eye coordination (HEC), isometric neuromuscular control (INC), maximal voluntary isometric contractile force (MVIC-F), isometric muscular endurance capacity (IMEC) and various electromyographic (EMG) indices of fatigue in biceps brachii. A preliminary experiment was conducted to determine a drug dose that did not cause sedation of the research subjects. The agonist caused a significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in MVIC-F, INC and IMEC. There was a non significant (p = 0.08) decrease in EMG amplitude during the MVIC-F trial with the agonist, compared to the effect of the placebo. The median EMG frequency during the IMEC test was also significantly less with the agonist, when compared to the placebo effect. There was a decline in RT and HEC, although this was not significant. These findings indicate that a serotonin receptor agonist causes a decrease in neuromuscular function during isometric muscle contractions. The decrements in muscle function reported in this study may help to explain previous reports of an association between increased brain serotonin concentration and a reduction in endurance performance. Although the present study does not exclude the possibility that an increase in brain serotonin does cause fatigue by affecting organs peripheral to the brain, it provides evidence of fatigue within the central nervous system.  Further examination of the effect of a serotonin agonist on muscle function during non-isometric muscle contractions is warranted.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">serotonin</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">fatigue</field><field name="subject">rat</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">receptor</field><field name="subject">receptors</field><field name="subject">neuromuscular function</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040521.130535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ant Association and Speciation in Lycaenidae (Lepidoptera): Consequences of Novel Adaptations and Pleistocene Climate Changes</field><field name="creator">Eastwood, Rodney Gordon</field><field name="description">The butterfly family Lycaenidae (including the Riodinidae) contains an estimated 30% of all butterfly species and exhibits a diverse array of life history strategies.  The early stages of most lycaenids associate with ants to varying degrees, ranging from casual facultative coexistence through to obligate association where the long-term survival of the butterfly is dependent on the presence of its attendant ants.  Attendant ants guard the butterflies against predators and parasites during their vulnerable period of larval growth and pupation.  The caterpillars, in return, reward the ants by providing attractive secretions from specialized glands in their cuticle.  The prevalence of caterpillar-ant associations in the species rich Lycaenidae is in contrast with other Lepidoptera, where ant association appears only as isolated cases in otherwise non ant-associated lineages.  This has led to the proposal that ant association may have influenced lycaenid diversification or even enhanced the rates of speciation in the group.  In contrast, facultative ant-associated butterflies exhibit high levels of host plant integrity, so it is reasonable to assume that host plants may have played a significant role in their diversification.  Since the influence of ants (or plants) on diversification is independent of geographic speciation modes such as vicariance or peripheral isolates, there is an underlying inference of sympatric speciation.  Certain prerequisites thought to be important for sympatric speciation, such as mating on the host plant (or in the presence of the appropriate ant) as well as ant dependent oviposition preferences are characteristic of many obligate myrmecophiles.  Not surprisingly, it has been suggested that evidence for sympatric speciation is more likely to be found in the Insecta since this additional mode of diversification could account for the large numbers of insect species.  This thesis tested the diversification processes in obligate and facultative ant associated lycaenids using comparative methodologies in hierarchical molecular phylogenetic analyses.  First, several hypotheses relating to the influence of ants on diversification in obligately ant associated lycaenid butterflies were tested in a phylogeographic analysis of the Australian endemic Jalmenus evagoras.  The phylogeographic analysis revealed that regional isolation of butterfly subpopulations coincident with locally adapted ant taxa could generate a phylogenetic pattern in which related lycaenids would be seen to associate with related or ecologically similar ants.  Likewise, ecological shifts in habitat preferences by lycaenids could lead to co-diversification with habitat specialist ants, even though in both cases, the ants may play only an incidental role in the diversification process.  A comparative methodology was then applied in a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the genus Jalmenus to test for a signal of diversification consistent with shifts in ant partners, and to infer the processes by which ants could influence speciation.  Several other specific hypotheses relating to monophyly and taxonomy were also examined.  Comparative analysis of the Jalmenus phylogeny found that attendant ant shifts coincided with high levels of sympatry among sister species.  This pattern could be explained by sympatric speciation; however, data suggested it was more likely that ant shifts occurred during butterfly population expansions as a result of vegetation and climate changes in the Pleistocene.  Fragmentation of populations associating with novel ants could promote rapid ecological and behavioural changes and this could result in reproductive isolation of conspecifics when in secondary contact.  Diversification would then continue in sympatry.  In contrast, secondary contact of populations associating with the same ant species would result in homogenisation of the two lycaenid lineages or the extinction of one.  A phylogeographic analysis of the facultative myrmecophiles, Theclinesthes albocincta/T. hesperia, was then undertaken to infer the evolutionary processes (such as the effects of host plant shifts) that could result in extant demographics.  Species-specific questions of taxonomy, relative population ages and dispersal routes in arid Australia were also addressed.  Results from the analysis suggested the two taxa were conspecific and had diversified in the late Pleistocene as a consequence of isolation in refugia in and around the arid areas of mainland Australia.  However, as was the case in the J. evagoras population analysis in which attendant ant shifts were not detected, host plant shifts were not detected in the population analysis of T. albocincta/hesperia.  Host plant or attendant ant shifts manifest more frequently at the species level, thus it was necessary to test the influence of host plant shifts at this higher level.  The comparative methodology was then applied to a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the facultative ant-associated section Theclinesthes (comprising Theclinesthes, Sahulana and Neolucia) to test for modes of diversification consistent with host plant shifts.  The relative importance of other influences on diversification was also assessed.  Akin to the Jalmenus analysis, the prediction that sister species ranges should broadly overlap when a shift in host plants had taken place was upheld in the comparative analysis.  Species in the genera Jalmenus and Theclinesthes were found to have diversified in the Pleistocene so were subject to the same climatic oscillations that influenced patterns of vegetation expansion and contraction across much of Australia.  Thus, the similarity and predictability of relationships in the comparative analyses based on biological data suggested that host plant shifts have influenced diversification in facultative myrmecophiles by inhibiting gene flow in secondary contact in similar fashion to that of attendant ant shifts identified in the Jalmenus phylogeny.  Interpretation of data in these analyses suggested that allopatric diversification was the most common mode of speciation.  Isolation was inferred to be the result of fragmentation following long distance dispersal across wide expanses of marginal habitat, or vicariance following the closing of biogeographical barriers.  However, attendant-ant and host-plant shifts clearly played an important role in the diversification process, and in the maintenance of species integrity among lycaenid butterflies.  Furthermore, exceptions to the predicted patterns of range overlap and ecological shifts provided clues to additional modes of diversification including shifts in habitat preferences and an unusual temporal shift following changes in specific host plant phenology resulting in allochronic diversification.  Inferring modes of diversification using comparative methods based on range overlap and biological traits in a phylogenetic context is not new; however, the interpretation presented in this thesis is in contrast with contemporary methods.  It is clear that the patterns of species range overlap and the ecological preferences of sister taxa are intimately related among lycaenid species that diversified during the Pleistocene.  As a result, different influences on diversification can be highlighted in phylogenies when applying existing comparative methodologies but without necessarily drawing the same conclusions about modes of diversification.  A more inclusive explanation for patterns of range overlap among sister taxa is detailed, a consequence of which is a method for estimating rates of extinction in a phylogeny where comprehensive distributional, biological and taxonomic data are available.  These patterns and predictions may be applicable to a range of taxa, especially those that have diversified in the Pleistocene.  Plans for future studies are outlined.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lycaenidae</field><field name="subject">Lepidoptera</field><field name="subject">butterfly species</field><field name="subject">lycaenids</field><field name="subject">ants</field><field name="subject">Attendant ants</field><field name="subject">larval growth and pupation</field><field name="subject">caterpillars</field><field name="subject">Novel Adaptations</field><field name="subject">Pleistocene Climate Changes</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071130.134932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Prevention of Police Corruption and Misconduct: A Criminological Analysis of Complaints Against Police</field><field name="creator">Ede, Andrew</field><field name="description">The reform measures recommended by the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct (referred to as the "Fitzgerald Inquiry") radically transformed the face of policing in Queensland. The most significant of these recommendations was the establishment of an external oversight body, the Criminal Justice Commission (CJC), which has independence from executive government and holds the power to investigate not only police but any public servant or politician. Other recommendations included "Whistleblower" legislation, increasing sanctions for serious misconduct, lateral recruitment and promotion by merit rather than seniority. The first main research question tested in this thesis is whether these reform measures have produced improvements in the following areas: the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes for dealing with complaints against police; public confidence in those processes and the public standing of the Queensland Police Service (QPS) generally; standards of police behaviour; the incidence of corrupt conduct; and police attitudes towards reporting misconduct by their fellow officers. These Fitzgerald Inquiry reforms were strategies primarily derived from two schools of thought describing the nature and cause of police corruption: deterrence based theory (including "individual" or "rotten apple" theory) and cultural (also labeled "cultural" or "socialisation") based theory. To date most strategies used to combat police corruption have been underpinned by these theories. A third theory - situational based theory (sometimes titled "environmental" or "opportunity" theory) - which has had success in crime prevention, has been scarcely used in the area of police corruption. However, an extensive body of research has affirmed the effects of situational factors on police behaviour, suggesting the potential for the application of situational crime prevention initiatives in combatting police corruption. The second research question proposed in this thesis is whether situational based theory could also be beneficial in the prevention of police corruption. Data drawn upon to test the first research question were interviews and surveys with police officers, public attitude surveys and statistics from the processing of complaints against police. Although each source has limitations, collectively the data are sufficiently comprehensive - and robust - to defend conclusions about the general direction of the changes which have occurred. These data indicate that the Fitzgerald Inquiry reforms have, at least to some degree, had their intended impact on the QPS. These reforms have contributed to an apparent improvement in public confidence in the complaints system and the QPS generally. Moreover, the available evidence suggests that the Fitzgerald Inquiry reforms have resulted in a weakening of the police code of silence. As far as the specific issue of corruption in the QPS is concerned, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from existing data sources. However, the weight of the available evidence is that such conduct is less pervasive and occurs at lower levels than was the case in the pre-Fitzgerald Inquiry QPS. It is very difficult to ascertain which reform components were the most effective and which were not helpful at all, as these reform measures were initiated simultaneously. For example, the negative elements of the police culture may have been eliminated or reduced but whether it was the cultural strategies or one of the deterrence based strategies influencing officer behaviour remains unknown.  The second main research question the thesis poses is that the use of situational crime prevention techniques has potential for contributing to the prevention of police corruption. A situational analysis of complaints against police data, including the development of a typology for classifying types of police corruption and misconduct, was used as an example of how this may be accomplished in Queensland. The study provides some, albeit limited, support for the hypothesis that situational crime prevention methods are applicable to police corruption. Based upon three years of complaints data, enough homogenous cases were gathered to enable the analysis of four categories of police corruption - Opportunistic Thefts, Driving under the Influence, Assault (while off-duty), and Theft from Employer. Given that this study only used three years of complaints data held by the CJC and more than nine years of data exist, productive situational analyses of many other categories of corruption is probable. This study also illustrated that complaints against police data are being under utilised by the QPS and the CJC. For future research in the situational analysis of complaints data, I recommend improving the gathering of data from complaints files for storage in electronic form to enable situational prevention analysis to be conducted more readily. A geographical example was used to illustrate further how complaints against police data could be more extensively utilised as a prevention tool. This analysis was conducted at an organisation unit level determined primarily by geographical factors. The complaint patterns of units of similar "task environments", as measured by unit size and type of duties performed, were compared in an attempt to identify those units experiencing the presence or absence of "bad apples" or a "negative culture". This study led to the conclusion that a divisional analysis of complaints data can provide information valuable in combatting police corruption. When task environment was held constant, it was possible to identify units experiencing the effects of possible "bad apples" and/or "negative cultures".  Once these particular units were identified, intervention strategies to address the units' particular problem could be constructed. Future research in this area would involve ongoing divisional data analysis followed-up by individual assessment of officers identified as "bad apples", or  a "compare-and-contrast" procedure to distinguish features requiring correction in units identified as having a "negative culture". The research findings presented in this thesis are that progress has occurred in a number of areas in addressing the problems identified by the Fitzgerald Inquiry, but that there is undoubtedly scope for more to be achieved. Despite the very significant increase in the resources and powers available to investigators post-Fitzgerald, it is still difficult to prove that a police officer engaged in misconduct, or that other officers were aware of this fact and had failed to take action, because of the constraints imposed by evidentiary and legal requirements. Thus, while it is vital to maintain an effective and credible independent complaints investigation system and ensure that there is a proper internal discipline process in place, the scope for increasing the "deterrent power" of the present system is limited. Putting more resources into complaints investigations might make a difference at the margins, but is unlikely to lead to a significant increase in the probability of a complaint being substantiated and a sanction imposed. Investing more resources in investigations has an additional cost in that such resources are then lost to other efforts to combat corruption  that may provide more fruitful results in the long term. The value of an occasional substantiation is placed above the ability to engage in a large amount of prevention work. Inevitably then, three clear messages are apparent. First, continued effort must be made to modify the organisational climate of the QPS in terms of commitment to integrity. Recommended strategies to accomplish this end are to continue the recruitment of more educated, female and older officers to reduce police-citizen conflict and the negative elements of the police culture, and also to develop a comprehensive, integrated approach to ethics education for QPS officers at all ranks and positions. Second, other forms of  deterrence against misconduct are needed such as the use of covert strategies like integrity testing which could be conducted in conjunction with the CJC. Third, a greater emphasis needs to be placed on developing and implementing preventive strategies. This thesis has shown that valuable prevention strategies can be gained from situational and divisional analysis of complaints data, and a range of proactive management options based upon situational crime prevention theory are recommended. These strategies have application in any police service.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">police corruption</field><field name="subject">police misconduct</field><field name="subject">criminology</field><field name="subject">criminological</field><field name="subject">Queensland Police Service</field><field name="subject">complaint</field><field name="subject">complaints</field><field name="subject">Fitzgerald Inquiry</field><field name="subject">reform</field><field name="subject">complaints against police</field><field name="subject">situational crime</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">Criminal Justice Commission</field><field name="subject">CJC</field><field name="subject">QPS</field><field name="subject">police culture</field><field name="subject">police code</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030102.114721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bilingualism among Teachers of English as a Second Language: A Study of Second Language Learning Experience as a Contributor to the Professional Knowledge and Beliefs of Teachers of ESL to Adults</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Elizabeth Margaret</field><field name="description">This study is an investigation of the contribution of second language learning experience to the professional knowledge and beliefs of teachers of ESL to adults. The literature reveals that very little has been written about the language background of the ESL teacher who teaches English through English to adult immigrants. The thesis proposes an explanation for this based on the historical development of the profession, and argues that despite vast changes in second language acquisition theory and pedagogy in the last fifty years, an English-only classroom fronted by a teacher who is monolingual or who is encouraged to behave as if he or she is monolingual, has remained the dominant practice in Australia. The research study is not a consideration of the merits of bilingual teaching versus monolingual teaching in English-only. Instead, it seeks to understand whether teachers who do have another language draw on it in ways relevant to the teaching of English, and to suggest reasons why teachers' languages are disregarded in the profession. In doing so, the thesis draws on key bodies of literature in bilingualism, second language acquisition, teacher cognition and critical studies in an attempt to provide a framework for considering the research questions.  The study employed a qualitative, interpretive research design involving semi-structured interviews and the taking of detailed language biographies from a total of thirty-one practising teachers of ESL. Language biographies were analysed and categorised along several parameters, and the major distinctions made were between circumstantial bilinguals, elective bilinguals and monolinguals.  Three key themes emerged: teachers' beliefs about learning a second language, the contribution made by teachers' language learning experience to their reported beliefs and practices, and teachers' beliefs about the role of the first language in second language learning. Bilingual teachers, both circumstantial and elective, appeared to have more realistic and optimistic beliefs about the nature of language learning than did monolingual teachers. Bilingual teachers appeared to see language learning as challenging but achievable. They recognised the dynamic nature of learning as incorporating progress, stagnation, attrition and re-learning. Monolingual teachers tended to see second language learning as almost impossible, and fraught with the potential for loss of self-esteem. Both groups talked about their own language learning as a private undertaking unrelated in any public way to their professional lives.  The contribution made by language learning background fell into two groupings: of insights about language and language use, and about language learning and language teaching. Four key aspects of the former were insights about language in general deriving from knowledge of more than one; insights from contrasting LOTE and English; insights about the language-using experiences of bilinguals and biculturals, and insights about the possibilities of LOTE as a pedagogical tool in the ESL class. The second grouping included insights into learning strategies; insights about the affective aspects of being a language learner; knowledge of different teaching approaches from experience, and insights from different teaching contexts made possible by bilingualism. Overall the broader and richer the language background, the more sophisticated and developed were the insights which appeared to be relevant to teaching ESL.  The third data chapter analysed teachers' expressed beliefs about the role of learners' first language(s) (L1) in the ESL class. Here little difference was found between bilingual and monolingual teachers, but overall L1 was characterised as an undesirable element in the ESL class. Teachers' discourse regarding L1 was analysed and found to be heavily characterised by negative and pejorative terms. This finding, combined with the teachers' generally weakly-articulated rationales for the exclusion of L1, led to the conclusion that beliefs and practices regarding L1 are a consequence of the monolingual focus of the ESL profession.  The findings of the study in general are that ESL teachers draw on any language learning experience as a resource in teaching, and 'experiential knowledge' seems to be readily available to them in the ways they represent their own knowledge and beliefs in talk. It appears to be important in informing and shaping their conceptions of their practice as language teachers. There are differences between bilingual and monolingual teachers in that the former have much richer resources on which to draw. There are added insights which come from circumstantial or elective bilingual experience, from being a non-native English speaker, and from formal and informal learning experience. In general, the more and varied the language learning experience, the deeper and more sophisticated the resource it is to draw on in teaching. It is argued that the teaching of ESL is constructed as "the teaching of English" rather than as "the teaching of a second language", meaning that the 'experiential knowledge' (Wallace 1991) of bilingual teachers is unvalued. It appears to be accepted and unquestioned that a monolingual teacher can teach a learner to be bilingual.  These propositions are discussed in the light of the writings of critical theorists to give a wider perspective on the monolingual discourse of the ESL profession. Bourdieu's notion of 'habitus' as strategic practice which is structured by a sociocultural environment (Bourdieu 1977a) is the basis for Gogolin's (1994) idea of a 'monolingual habitus' in education. Their work, and that of Skutnabb-Kangas (2000a) who refers to 'monolingual reductionism', suggest a social, political and discursal explanation for the invisibility of teachers' languages in the ESL profession. It is suggested that teacher language learning background should become a legitimate topic for discussion and further research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">English as a Second Language</field><field name="subject">ESL</field><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">language learning</field><field name="subject">bilingualism</field><field name="subject">bilingual</field><field name="subject">monolingual</field><field name="subject">Pierre Bourdieu</field><field name="subject">Tove Skutnabb-Kangas</field><field name="subject">Ingrid Gogolin</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040618.172404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-Reliance Guidelines for Large Scale Robot Colonies</field><field name="creator">Engwirda, Anthony</field><field name="description">A Large Scale Robot Colony (LSRC) is a complex artifact comprising of a significant population of both mobile and static robots. LSRC research is in its literary infancy and it is therefore necessary to rely upon external fields for the appropriate framework, Multi Agent Systems (MAS) and Large Scale Systems (LSS). At the intersection of MAS, LSS and LSRC exist near identical issues, problems and solutions. If attention is paid to coherence then solution portability is possible.  The issue of Self-Reliability is poorly addressed by the MAS research field. Disparity between the real world and simulation is another area of concern. Despite these deficiencies, MAS and LSS are perceived as the most appropriate frameworks.  MAS research focuses on three prime areas, cognitive science, management and interaction.  LSRC is focused on Self-Sustainability, Self-Management and Self-Organization. While LSS research was not primarily intended for populations of mobile robots, it does address key issues of LSRC, such as effective sustainability and management. Implementation of LSRC that is based upon the optimal solution for any one or two of the three aspects will be inferior to a coherent solution based upon all three.  LSRC&#146;s are complex organizations with significant populations of both static and mobile robots. The increase in population size and the requirement to address the issue of Self-Reliance give rise to new issues. It is no longer sufficient to speak only in terms of robot intelligence, architecture, interaction or team behaviour, even though these are still valid topics. Issues such as population sustainability and management have greater significance within LSRC. As the size of a robot populations increases, minor uneconomical decisions and actions inhibit the performance of the population. Interaction must be made economical within the context of the LSRC. Sustainability of the population becomes significant as it enables stable performance and extended operational lifespan. Management becomes significant as a mechanism to direct the population so as to achieve near optimal performance.  The Self-Sustainability, Self-Management and Self-Organization of LSRC are vastly more complex than in team robotics. Performance of the overall population becomes more significant than individual or team achievement.  This thesis is a presentation of the Cooperative Autonomous Robot Colony (CARC) architecture. The CARC architecture is novel in that it offers a coherent baseline solution to the issue of mobile robot Self-Reliance. This research uses decomposition as a mechanism to reduce problem complexity. Self-Reliance is decomposed into Self-Sustainability, Self-Management, and Self-Organization. A solution to the issue of Self-Reliance will comprise of conflicting sub-solutions. A product of this research is a set of guidelines that manages the conflict of sub-solutions and maintains a coherent solution.  In addressing the issue of Self-Reliance, it became apparent that Economies of Scale, played an important role. The effects of Economies of Scale directed the research towards LSRC&#146;s.  LSRC&#146;s demonstrated improved efficiency and greater capability to achieve the requirements of Self-Reliance. LSRC&#146;s implemented with the CARC architecture would extend human capability, enabling large scale operations to be performed in an economical manner, within real world and real time environments, including those of a remote and hostile nature. The theory and architecture are supported using published literature, experiments, observations and mathematical projections. Contributions of this work are focused upon the three pillars of Self-Reliance addressed by CARC: Self-Sustainability, Self-Management and Self-Organization.  The chapter on Self-Sustainability explains and justifies the relevance of this issue, what it is, why it is important and how it can be achieved. Self-Sustainability enables robots to continue to operate beyond disabling events by addressing failure and routine maintenance.  Mathematical projections are used to compare populations of non-sustained and sustained robots. Computer modeling experiments are used to demonstrate the feasibility of Self-Sustainability, including extended operational life, the maintenance of optimal work flow and graceful physical degradation (GPD). A detailed explanation is presented of Sustainability Functions, Colony Sites, Static Robot Roles, Static Robot Failure Options, and Polymorphism.  The chapter on Self-Management explores LSS research as a mechanism to exert influence over a LSRC. An experimental reactive management strategy is demonstrated. This strategy while limited does indicate promising potential directions for future research including the Man in the Loop (MITL) strategy highly desired by NASA JPL for off world command and control of a significant robot colony (Huntsberger, et. al., 2000). Experiments on Communication evaluate both Broadcast Conveyance (BC) and Message Passing Conveyance (MPC). These experiments demonstrate the potential of Message Passing as a low cost system for LSRC communication. Analysis of Metrics indicates that a Performance Based Feedback Method (PBFM) and a Task Achievement Method (TAM) are both necessary and sufficient to monitor a LSRC.  The chapter on Self-Organization describes a number of experiments, algorithms and protocols on Reasoning Robotics, a minor variant of Reactive Robotics. Reasoning Robotics utilizes an Event Driven Architecture (EDA) rather than a Stimulus Driven Architecture (SDA) common to Reactive Robotics. Enhanced robot performance is demonstrated by a combination of EDA and environmental modification enabling stigmergy. These experiments cover Intersection Navigation with contingency for Multilane Intersections, a Radio Packet Controller (RPC) algorithm, Active and Passive Beacons including a communication protocol, mobile robot navigation using Migration Decision Functions (MDF&#146;s), including MDF positional errors.  The central issue addressed by this thesis is the production of Self-Reliance guidelines for LSRC&#146;s. Self-Reliance is perceived as a critical issue in advancing the useful and productive applications for LSRC&#146;s. LSRC&#146;s are complex with many issues in related fields of MAS and LSS. Decomposition of Self-Reliance into Self-Sustainability, Self-Management and Self-Organization were used to aid in problem understanding. It was found that Self-Sustainability extends the operational life of individual robots and the LSRC. Self-Management enables the exertion of human influence over the LSRC, such that the ratio of humans to robots is reduced but not eliminated. Self-Organization achieves and enhances performance through a routine and reliable LSRC environment. The product of this research was the novel CARC architecture, which consists of a set of Self-Reliance guidelines and algorithms. The Self-Reliance guidelines manage conflict between optimal solutions and provide a framework for LSRC design. This research was supported by literature, experiments, observations and mathematical projections.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Large Scale Robot Colony</field><field name="subject">LSRC</field><field name="subject">mobile and static robots</field><field name="subject">Multi Agent Systems</field><field name="subject">MAS</field><field name="subject">Large Scale Systems</field><field name="subject">LSS</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070913.100750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic and Mechanistic Investigations of Some Novel Organophosphorus Reagents</field><field name="creator">Fairfull-Smith, Kathryn Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The alkoxytriphenylphosphonium ion intermediate of the Mitsunobu reaction for the esterification and inversion of configuration of an alcohol can be generated using the Hendrickson reagent, triphenylphosphonium anhydride trifluoromethanesulfonate, 27.  While 27 was used in place of the Mitsunobu reagents (triphenylphosphine and a dialkyl azodicarboxylate) for the esterification of primary alcohols, the reaction failed with secondary alcohols such as (-)-menthol giving predominately elimination rather than the desired SN2 displacement.  The difference between the two reactions was shown to be related to the more 'ionic' conditions generated when the Hendrickson reagent 27 was employed.  An extreme sensitivity of the Mitsunobu reaction to the presence of salts was discussed and may indicate a mechanism involving ion pair clustering.  Five-, six- and seven-membered cyclic analogues of the Hendrickson reagent 90-92 were prepared.  A kinetic comparison of the cyclic analogues 90-92 revealed that a considerable increase in the rate of esterification could be achieved when the five-membered ring analogue 90 was used in a non-polar solvent such as toluene.  Selected acyclic analogues of the Hendrickson reagent 27 possessing tributyl 118, tricyclohexyl 130 and diphenyl-2-pyridyl 137 functionalities were synthesised.  However when 118, 130 and 137 were used for the attempted esterification of (-)-menthol, elimination was the major reaction pathway.  Diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphonium anhydride triflate 137 was found to be a useful reagent for the synthesis of acyclic dialkyl ethers from primary alcohols.  A polymeric version of the five-membered ring analogue 56, prepared by reaction of the polymer-supported 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphinyl)ethane 57 with triflic anhydride, was used for the preparation of simple esters and amides.   A new dehydrating agent, polymer-supported triphenylphosphine ditriflate 157, was readily prepared from the oxidised form of commercially available polymer-supported triphenylphosphine and triflic anhydride.  A wide range of dehydration-type reactions, such as ester, amide, anhydride, peptide, ether and nitrile formation, were performed in high yield using polymer-supported triphenylphosphine ditriflate 157.  The reagent 157 was easily recovered and re-used several times without loss of efficiency.  The use of 4-dimethylaminopyridine allowed the esterification of secondary alcohols with 157 to proceed without elimination and gave esters in high yield but with retention of configuration.  Both reagents 56 and 157 provide an alternative to the Mitsunobu reaction, where the use of azodicarboxylates and chromatography to remove the phosphine oxide by-product can be avoided.  However, the Mitsunobu reaction retains its supremacy for the inversion of configuration of a secondary alcohol. Preliminary investigations on the phosphityation of alcohols via the Hendrickson reagent 27, 1,3-benzodioxole formation using the Mitsunobu reaction and azodicarboxylate alternatives in the Mitsunobu reaction are described.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organophosphorus compounds</field><field name="subject">Mitsunobu reaction</field><field name="subject">chemistry</field><field name="subject">esters</field><field name="subject">esterification</field><field name="subject">ethers</field><field name="subject">alcohols</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040917.081950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sport Fan Tourism: Understanding Those Who Travel To Follow Sport Teams</field><field name="creator">Fairley, Sheranne</field><field name="description">Sport events and attractions which encourage both participants and spectators are seen as significant contributors to the tourism economy (Delpy, 1998; Glyptis, 1991; Standeven &amp; DeKnop, 1999).  Further, Gratton and Taylor (2000) note that sport related travel accounts for 7% of total expenditure on sport.  To date, the main focus of event sport tourism research has been on the economic impact of large-scale sport events (Burgan &amp; Mules, 1992; Crompton, 1995; Mules &amp; Faulkner, 1996; Walo, Bull, &amp; Breen, 1996).  However, Higham (1999) posits that smaller scale events such as regular season games may be of greater benefit to the host community as these events are hosted within existing infrastructure and therefore limit the need for public expenditure. However, fans who travel to regular season competition are a market segment that has been largely ignored by both sport and tourism marketers.  Sport marketers have focused on home game attendance, media viewership and product purchases, while tourism marketers have focused on leveraging the destination.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that fans who travel organise a substantial proportion of their discretionary time and income around this activity.  Recent research by Gibson, Willming and Holdnak (2002, 2003) has begun to understand the behaviours of sport fans who travel to home games.  This study seeks to understand the behaviours and experiences of those who travel to attend away games.  In particular the study asks: What motivates fans to travel to follow professional sport teams, what experiences fans have and seek during the travel, and what place does travelling to follow a sport team have in the overall consumption behaviour of sport fans. This study examined the motives and experiences of six fan groups travelling interstate to follow their Australian Football League (AFL) team in the 2001 season.  As the behaviours and experiences of those who travel to follow sport teams have not previously been explored, exploratory analysis using an iterative process of constant comparison between data colleted from the research setting and the existent literature.  Using this method the researcher was able to describe the social world under investigation without preconceived hypotheses.  The researcher travelled interstate with each fan group, and collected data via participant observation and interviews with key informants.  Data were coded using standard protocols for analysis of qualitative data (Spradley, 1980).  The researcher read through the transcripts and field notes and coded all phrases and opinions from the manuscript.  Data were analysed through the process of data reduction, selective sampling of the literature, and selected sampling of the data (Stern, 1980).  From the initial codes, data reduction identified core variables and emergent themes.  Through this grounded theory methodology, a conceptual model was developed which illustrates the motives and experiences of those who travel to follow professional sport teams. Three distinct types of groups were identified, each garnering a distinctive sport tourism experience.  The groups identified were: supporter groups, long-term travel groups, and temporary travel groups.  While travel to follow the team is the stated rationale for all three groups, the game experience for each is substantially different, four major themes emerged which distinguished the groups and the experiences that they had.  These were: (1) group structure, (2) trip characteristics, (3) socialisation, and (4) game experience and reaction to game outcome.  Each type of group was found to have a distinct group structure, communication pattern, but differed in terms of the objects to which they identified.  Findings suggest that sport fans do not necessarily identify with the team or related object, but can identify with a smaller social group, which has a shared interest in the team.  These elements of group structure and point of identification were found to have a reciprocal relationship with various travel elements that were utilised by each group including the mode of transport, temporal elements, choice of destination, and activities at the destination.  In particular, the travel elements were chosen so that each group type could best express and experience that which is core to each group.  Further analysis suggested that the experience of each of the groups was influenced by the continual development of the group both before and during the travel experience.  For the supporter groups and long-term travel groups, rituals, symbols, and folklore played a key role in the experience.  These elements of performance were used to continually shape and interpret the travel experience. One would expect that the game would have elevated importance, as it is the activity that legitimates each group.  However, the on-field game did not have prime importance.  Instead the different points of identification of each group were used as a basis through which the game was experienced.  Key implications for sport and tourism marketing suggest that the sport tourism experience is more than an experience of place or an experience of watching the sport.  Identification with a small social group is sufficient to generate travel to follow a team.  By providing a setting which immerses participants in a particular identity for a prolonged period of time, the act of travelling itself can create a social climate that encourages participants to undertake the trip week after week, and form deep connection to the team.  Implications for practice and future research directions are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sport fan tourism</field><field name="subject">regular season competition</field><field name="subject">tourism economy</field><field name="subject">Australian rules football</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070716.153940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Professional Development on Ministerial Leaders' Thinking and Practice</field><field name="creator">Fairley, Suzanne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This study focused on the extent to which professional development can bring about changes in ministerial leaders' thinking and practice, and was based on a constructivist approach to learning. The study adopted a qualitative methodology to answer the three research questions: 1. To what extent can professional development assist ministerial leaders to change their thinking about themselves as leaders and their actual leadership practices? 2.What changes (if any) occurred in each of the participants' conceptions of ministerial leadership during a Ministerial Leadership Development Program (MLDP)? 3. To what extent did changes in participants' thinking about ministerial leadership affect their actual practice? There were nineteen participants in a Ministerial Leadership Development Program which was conducted between March and October 2000 by the Uniting Church in Australia (Queensland Synod). Data were gathered at the beginning and end of the MLDP and one year after its completion. The methods used to collect data were concept maps of 'effective leaders', repertory grids based on participants' views of 'effective' and 'ineffective' leaders, interviews and a survey. The concept maps and repertory grids were completed at the beginning and end of the MLDP. The interviews and survey were conducted one year after the program was completed. The interviews were conducted with a small group of the participants (five) and the survey was completed by lay leaders from the congregations where the nineteen participants were ministering. For each of the five interviewees a case was constructed using methodological triangulation and an interpretive approach. Triangulation of the three types of data (concept maps, repertory grids and interviews) enabled identification of important components of individuals' thinking and practice. The survey produced data on the perspectives of lay leaders, thus enabling comparison between the perspectives of the ministerial leaders and their lay leaders. The study found a variety of initial conceptions of effective ministerial leadership amongst the participants. Most of these conceptions were related to leadership skills and qualities. Very few participants demonstrated an understanding of the nature of effective ministerial leadership at the beginning of the program. However, during the MLDP, the conceptions of participants developed and by the end of the program most of them demonstrated a more holistic understanding of the nature of leadership, and particularly, the nature of Christian leadership. In relation to changes in leaders' practice, the study found that significant changes were reported as taking place in leaders' practice and most of this was linked to their thinking changing first. Many of these changes in practice were attributed to the encouragement leaders received in mentor groups. These reported changes in practice were also supported by data from the lay leaders' survey. Thus there was consistency in data from ministerial leaders' perspectives and from lay leaders' perspectives. Apparent trends across the cases included links between the leaders' feelings of self confidence and their capacity to lead effectively; the difficulties associated with following a minister who had a very different conception of effective leadership from his/her own; the unrealistic expectations some congregational members have of their ministers; and the difficulty of moving a congregation from one understanding of ministry to another. The results of this study have implications for pre-service education, continuing education, and the policy-making committees of the Synod, and suggest fruitful areas for further research. The results of the research are discussed in relation to relevant literature. Implications of the findings for the appropriate stakeholders are highlighted, and some ongoing issues for ministerial leadership are raised.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">ministerial leadership</field><field name="subject">concept maps</field><field name="subject">repertory grids</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030304.094147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">So Hard the Conquering: A Life of Irene Longman</field><field name="creator">Fallon, Patricia</field><field name="description">This biography of Irene Longman is the story of a remarkable woman. A woman of integrity, intelligence, courage and compassion. It is also the story about the period in which she lived and how her life was inevitably interwoven with the lives of others and with the social structure and culture of the times. What made Irene Longman unique was that she became the first woman to sit in the Queensland Parliament. Irene Longman was elected to the Queensland Parliament in 1929, defeating the sitting Labor member in Bulimba. She was nominated by the Queensland Women&#146;s Electoral League and endorsed by the Country Progressive National Party, but held the seat for only one term as Labor swept back into power in 1932. Longman&#146;s career in the Moore government coincided with a brief interruption of continuous Labor rule in Queensland (1915-1957). No other woman was elected to State Parliament in Queensland until after Irene Longman&#146;s death in 1964 at the age of 87. Though her parliamentary career was short, Irene Longman was active in public life for over thirty years. This thesis brings to light her early childhood in Tasmania, her education and development while living in Sydney and will describe her career and the associational networks which shaped her political ideas. In 1904 at Toowoomba, Irene married Heber Longman and they made Queensland their permanent home. Although this study investigates a particular historical period in Australia, a wider account of Queensland life is incorporated to give a political context to Irene Longman&#146;s experiences in the decades after Federation. Irene Longman was involved in a wide range of social issues including town planning and the preservation of flora and fauna. But her professional and voluntary work was principally in the field of the welfare of women and children. Therefore, this thesis is not only a historical study but it also examines other discourses related to Irene Longman&#146;s experience and interest, such as feminism and women&#146;s reproductive function. I consider how the strength of maternal citizenship influences the way women lived their lives and understood their positions in the world.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irene Longman</field><field name="subject">biography</field><field name="subject">parliamentarians</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">social reform</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030801.170528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Across the Developmental Trajectory: Clinical Correlates and Cognitive Processing of Threat</field><field name="creator">Farrell, Lara J.</field><field name="description">Controlled scientific research into obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in adulthood has considerably progressed over the past two decades; however, current research into childhood OCD is still in its infancy by comparison. As a result, current psychological conceptualisations of OCD during childhood, including approaches to treatment, are almost entirely based on adult models of the disorder. Previous research however, examining the clinical phenomenology of OCD has provided some evidence that OCD might be associated with different clinical correlates at different stages of development. In particular, there appears to be a bimodal distribution in terms of the age of onset of the disorder, a male predominance during childhood and adolescence compared to adulthood, stronger familial aggregation of OCD in early onset cases, and differences in the types of symptoms and the patterns of comorbidity across age groups. The first study aimed to assess the developmental continuity in clinical correlates of OCD across 3 distinct age groups, including; children (n = 40), adolescents (n = 44) and adults (n = 41). It was hypothesised that the sample of children would be predominantly male, and would have a higher familial aggregation of OCD and/or anxiety/depression in first-degree relatives. It was further hypothesised that there would be significant age-related differences in terms of specific symptoms, patterns of comorbidity, OCD severity, functional impairment, and level of insight and distress. The results of this study supported the developmental heterogeneity hypothesis, with significant differences occurring across age groups on a number of clinical features of OCD including age at onset, symptoms experienced, comorbidity, severity, insight and impairment. The recognition of developmental differences in clinical features of OCD will assist in the accurate assessment and diagnosis of the disorder, and will allow for refinement of current treatment strategies to ensure treatments effectively target features of the disorder as it presents at different developmental stages.  While the cognitive theory of OCD is one of the most widely accepted accounts of the maintenance of the disorder in adults, no study to date has systematically evaluated this theory across children, adolescents and adults with the disorder. Until empirical investigation examines the applicability of this theory to children and adolescents, we know very little about the cognitive processes associated with OCD during childhood or adolescence. The second study investigated developmental differences in the cognitive processing of threat in a sample of children (n = 34), adolescents (n = 39) and adults (n = 38) with OCD. Using an idiographic assessment approach, as well as self-report questionnaires, this study evaluated cognitive appraisals of responsibility, probability, severity, thought-action fusion (TAF), thought-suppression, self-doubt and cognitive control. It was hypothesised that there would be age related differences in reported responsibility for harm, probability of harm, severity of harm, thought suppression, TAF, self-doubt and cognitive control. Results demonstrated that children with OCD reported experiencing fewer intrusive thoughts, which were less distressing and less uncontrollable than those experienced by adolescents and adults with OCD. Furthermore, responsibility attitudes, probability biases and thought suppression strategies were significantly higher in adolescents and adults with OCD, compared to children. Cognitive processes of TAF, perceived severity of harm, self-doubt and cognitive control were found to be comparable across age groups. These findings suggest that some cognitive biases associated with OCD in adults, are in fact also associated with OCD during childhood and adolescence, however there remains some discontinuity across specific cognitive processes. For a developmentally sensitive theory of OCD, further investigation is clearly warranted into other possible age related maintenance factors of this disorder. Implications of these 2 empirical investigations are highlighted and directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obsessive-compulsive disorder</field><field name="subject">OCD</field><field name="subject">threat</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">cognitive processing</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040513.132648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Spirit of Accommodation: The Influence of the ALP's National Factions on Party Policy, 1996-2004</field><field name="creator">Faulkner, Xandra Madeleine</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the influence of the Australian Labor Party's (ALP's) national factions on Party policy. The specific emphasis is on policy development during Labor's 1996-2004 period in opposition. Through a total of 88 interviews, predominantly with members of Caucus including Kim Beazley, Simon Crean and Mark Latham, this thesis has been able to examine not only the formal policy development processes but, significantly, also the informal processes within the Party. The thesis begins with an overview of the national factions' organisation and operations in relation to policy development in both the organisational and parliamentary wings. It concentrates on exploring how the informal processes of the faction system dominate the formal Party structures, and demonstrates how the factional elite control these decision-making forums. The thesis then concentrates on analysing in-depth the factional influences on policies developed within the Immigration, Trade and Family and Community Services portfolios. These case studies were selected because they provoked debate, to varying degrees, in the Party. An understanding of how consensus was reached among the diverse perspectives, particularly between the factions, within the Party is critical to exploring the relationship between the national factions and policy development. The case studies cover a range of policy development modes, and therefore provide ample opportunity to explore factional dynamics in relation to policy formulation under different circumstances throughout the 1996-2004 period. This thesis utilises Arend Lijphart's theory of the Politics of Accommodation, which was originally developed to explain inter-party negotiations within the Dutch coalition government during the twentieth century. This theory is relevant to the study of the ALP's modern factions because, similar to the Dutch political system, the faction system operates on the power-sharing principle of proportional representation (PR). By applying Lijphart's theoretical framework, this thesis provides a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the ALP's factional dynamics in relation to policy. It gives an in-depth analysis of the elite control of the faction system in the domain of policy development. It demonstrates that faction leaders resolve contentious policy issues by negotiating in a 'spirit of accommodation' and when the factions adopt a policy position, the unwritten rules of the 'factional game' are applied to ensure the national factions reach a consensus on Party policy. Given that the national factions compete for power and sometimes pursue a different set of policy objectives, this 'spirit of accommodation' appears to be paradoxical; this palliative application of factional power is arguably in contrast to the general perception of faction politics. Through the presentation and analysis of original primary data this thesis makes a valuable contribution to the study of the ALP and factions in general, significantly advancing existing knowledge.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Labor Party factions</field><field name="subject">Australian Labor Party policy</field><field name="subject">politics of accommodation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070216.133604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improvements to Clause Weighting Local Search for Propositional Satisfiability</field><field name="creator">Ferreira Junior, Valnir</field><field name="description">The propositional satisfiability (SAT) problem is of considerable theoretical and practical relevance to the artificial intelligence (AI) community and has been used to model many pervasive AI tasks such as default reasoning, diagnosis, planning, image interpretation, and constraint satisfaction.  Computational methods for SAT have historically fallen into two broad categories: complete search and local search. Within the local search category, clause weighting methods are amongst the best alternatives for SAT, becoming particularly attractive on problems where a complete search is impractical or where there is a need to find good candidate solutions within a short time. The thesis is concerned with the study of improvements to clause weighting local search methods for SAT. The main contributions are:  A component-based framework for the functional analysis of local search methods.  A clause weighting local search heuristic that exploits longer-term memory arising from clause weight manipulations. The approach first learns which clauses are globally hardest to satisfy and then uses this information to treat these clauses differentially during weight manipulation [Ferreira Jr and Thornton, 2004].  A study of heuristic tie breaking in the domain of additive clause weighting local search methods, and the introduction of a competitive method that uses heuristic tie breaking instead of the random tie breaking approach used in most existing methods [Ferreira Jr and Thornton, 2005].  An evaluation of backbone guidance for clause weighting local search, and the introduction of backbone guidance to three state-of-the-art clause weighting local search methods [Ferreira Jr, 2006].  A new clause weighting local search method for SAT that successfully exploits synergies between the longer-term memory and tie breaking heuristics developed in the thesis to significantly improve on the performance of current state-of-the-art local search methods for SAT-encoded instances containing identifiable CSP structure.

The aims were to account for the renewal of Italian filmmaking from 1988, the New Italian cinema, and understand the conditions behind this renewal. The thesis identifies in the historical theme and in the recurrence of features from Italian cinema history elements of coherence with previous cinema production. The first consideration that emerges is that a triangulation between a new generation of filmmakers, their audience and recent history shaped the recovery of Italian cinema from 1988. A second consideration is that no discussion of Italian cinema can be separated from a discussion of that which it represents: Italian society and politics. This representation has not only addressed questions of identity for a cohort of spectators, but on occasions has captured the attention of the international audience. Thus the thesis follows a methodologic approach that positions the texts in relation to certain traditions in Italian filmmaking and to the context by taking into consideration also industrial factors and social and historical changes. By drawing upon a range of disciplines, from political history to socio-psychological studies, the thesis has focussed on representation of history and memory in two periods of Italian film history: the first and the last decade of twentieth century. The concern has been not so much to interpret the films, but to understand the processes that made the films and how spectators have applied their knowledge structures to make meaning of the films. Thus the thesis abstains from ascribing implicit meanings to films, but acknowledges how films project cultural contingencies. This is because film is shaped by production conditions and cultural and historical circumstances that make the film intelligible. As Bordwell stated in Making Meaning, "One can do other things with films besides 'reading' them" (1989, p. xiii). Within this framework, the thesis proposes a project that understands history film within the norms that govern Italian filmic output, those norms that regulate conditions of production and consumption and the relation between films from various traditions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">film</field><field name="subject">filmmaking</field><field name="subject">filmmakers</field><field name="subject">cinema</field><field name="subject">motion pictures</field><field name="subject">Italy</field><field name="subject">Italian</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">society</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050209.083648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functions of Self-Initiated Self-Repairs in an Advanced Japanese Language Classroom</field><field name="creator">Fincher, Amanda</field><field name="description">In the current research project the functions of self-initiated self-repairs in an advanced Japanese language classroom were investigated.  From the reviewed literature it was found that repairing is possible through monitoring, which includes error detection, and involves attention and memory.  Therefore, data was collected on the abilities of the participants in the current research project to repair, monitor and their attention levels and memory.  There were seven methods used to collect data; participant observation, classroom interaction tape recordings, a questionnaire, stimulated recall interviews, attention test, memory and attention test and proficiency level assessments.  From the participant observation, classroom interaction tape recordings and stimulated recall interviews data was collected on the repairs that the participants made and the way in which they monitored was explored.  The questionnaire revealed relevant background information, such as, number of years the participants had studied Japanese, which supplemented other information collected.  The attention test and memory and attention tests were used to obtain information on the participants&#146; perceptions of their levels of attention and their actual levels of attention and memory respectively.  The final data collected was on the participants&#146; own perceptions of their speaking proficiency levels in Japanese and an independent judge&#146;s evaluation of their levels.  The results of the data collected on the way in which the participants repaired and monitored showed that overall the participants repaired and monitored in ways that had been discussed in previous research on repairing and monitoring.  However, for the first known time, phenomena related to repairing and monitoring, which the researcher terms as communication strategies, are used frequently by the participants and also, that these communication strategies used and repairs made by the participants were not needed to be made.  In other words, the participants in the current research project were often repairing errors that had not been made.  As for the data collected on the participants&#146; attention levels and memory, no significant differences were found between the participants and neither did any differences reflect on the ways in which the participants repaired.  From the proficiency level assessments, further evidence was found that supported previous research done on repairing and monitoring as well.  Also, it was found that the participants under-estimated their levels of proficiency in comparison to the independent judge&#146;s evaluations.  Therefore, the participants both over repair and under estimate their Japanese speaking abilities.  This is seen as detrimental to the participants&#146; performances in Japanese.  Recommendations are made to use this data provided by Japanese language learners when repairing to guide instruction and to encourage learners to gain fluency by repairing less often than is thought necessary.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese language classroom</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">repairing</field><field name="subject">communication strategies</field><field name="subject">self-repair</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20080613.161329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Governments in Queensland: Industrial Relations, 1957-1961, 1989-1990</field><field name="creator">Fleming, Jenny</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to examine the capacity of new governments to influence partisan-based policy and legislation. It examines two newly elected Queensland governments - the Nicklin Country-Liberal government in 1957- 1961 and the Goss Labor government in 1989- 1990 and analyses the introduction by those governments of major industrial relations legislative reform. The Nicklin Coalition government was elected to the Queensland parliament in 1957 after the collapse of the Gair Labor government. The Coalition was committed to extensive industrial relations legislative reform but had not prepared for, or anticipated the constitutional, administrative and legal problems associated with such reform. Nor had it taken into account the concessions that would need to be made to the state's trade unions in order to effect its reforms. Consequently it was not until 1961 that it found the time was propitious for the introduction of its major legislative reforms and the restructuring of the state's principal industrial relations legislation. By contrast, in 1989 the Goss government elected as a consequence of the National Party's collapse in the face of the Fitzgerald Inquiry of 1987 had prepared itself for government. As a result it was able to take advantage of its newly elected status and the existence of the Hanger Report (1988) to introduce its legislative intentions quickly, in such a way that it did not alienate the business community. Preparation and circumstances therefore allowed Labor to repeal earlier legislation supported by business and introduce its own changes with little or no opposition. The thesis concludes that their political and economic inheritance and the existing policy environment will in varying degrees limit new governments. But their ability to introduce partisan-based legislative change quickly is also determined by the degree of preparation for the process of government, undertaken prior to their election. This thesis demonstrates that new governments can make a difference and effect changes to the industrial relations environment. However if this potential is to be realised and new governments are to take advantage of their newly elected status it will require a significant degree of administrative preparation or a considerable period of acclimatisation to the rigours of office.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial relations</field><field name="subject">Queensland government</field><field name="subject">Nicklin Coalition government</field><field name="subject">Gair Labor government</field><field name="subject">Goss government</field><field name="subject">Fitzgerald Inquiry</field><field name="subject">Hanger Report</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051109.142157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Cultural Significance of Web-Based Exchange Practices</field><field name="creator">Fletcher, Gordon Scott</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the cultural significance of Web-based exchange practices among the participants in contemporary western mainstream culture. The thesis argues that analysis of these practices shows how this culture is consumption oriented, event-driven and media obsessed. Initially, this argument is developed from a critical, hermeneutic, relativist and interpretive assessment that draws upon the works of authors such as Baudrillard and De Bord and other critiques of contemporary 'digital culture'. The empirical part of the thesis then examines the array of popular search terms used on the World Wide Web over a period of 16 months from September 2001 to February 2003. Taxanomic classification of these search terms reveals the limited range of virtual and physical artefacts that are sought by the users of Web search engines. While nineteen hundred individual artefacts occur in the array of search terms, these can classified into a relatively small group of higher order categories. Critical analysis of these higher order categories reveals six cultural traits that predominant in the apparently wide array of search terms; freeness, participation, do-it-yourself/customisation, anonymity/privacy, perversion and information richness. The these argues that these traits are part of a cultural complex that directly reflects the underlying motivations of contemporary western mainstream culture. The daily practices of Web-based search and exchange thus reproduce and reinforce this cultural complex. The empirical work of the thesis validates the critical assessment of western mainstream culture developed in the initial chapters of the thesis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web-based exchange practices</field><field name="subject">digital culture</field><field name="subject">world wide web</field><field name="subject">do-it-yourself customisation</field><field name="subject">information richness</field><field name="subject">contemporary western mainstream culture</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070118.090425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Undergraduate Assignment Writing: An Experiential Account</field><field name="creator">Fletcher, Margaret Anne</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine assignment writing as a phenomenon of academic writing. This was done through exploring the experiential accounts of members of a university writing community. Their accounts described the community's perceptions and experiences of literacy practices needed to write assignments, of how students developed these practices, and, of what constituted success in the writing.  A multi-method, embedded, case-study approach was used. Quantitative data were derived from first-year, second-year, and fourth-year respondents' perceptions and experiences related to assignment writing. A cross-sectional comparison of groups showed consistent year-level effects. Fourth-year students were more confident as writers than first-year and second-year students, and had less difficulty with declarative and procedural aspects of writing assignments. These findings were replicated in a repeated-measures study using a sub-group of first-year and fourth-year students.  However, when students contextualised their responses by nominating a subject and referring to their completion of its written assignment, first-year students reported less difficulty with the declarative aspects while fourth-year students were more positive in the procedural aspects. Year-level effects were found for what they reported as helpful in acquiring declarative and procedural knowledge of writing. First-year students reported a wider range of sources as helpful than fourth-year students did, with two exceptions. More of the latter had found information gained in consultations helpful in understanding an assignment question. Additionally more had found friends helpful. Second-year students generally were more positive than first-year and fourth-year students about the usefulness of information in helping them understand an assignment question and in writing it in an academic genre. Knowing how to write predicted success more strongly and consistently than any other factor.   Qualitative data informed findings from the quantitative analyses by providing experiential accounts about students' perceptions of themselves as assignment writers, their experiences when writing assignments, and how these experiences developed literacy practices that contributed to success. Additionally, qualitative data were collected from lecturers who convened first-year subjects and those who convened fourth-year subjects.  The qualitative data indicated students' strong reference to experiences of writing and of seeking help. Both had shaped their self-perceptions as writers and these had changed over time. First-year students believed that knowing what lecturers wanted in writing assignments was an important factor in success. They described their efforts to access this information and to give lecturers what they thought was wanted. Fourth-year students recognised the same factor, but were more self-reliant in approaching an assignment task. The change to greater internal control appeared to be an outcome of encountering inconsistent and confusing information from external sources over their four years of writing assignments. For their part, lecturers of first-year students said that successful students knew what to write and how to write it.  However, lecturers of fourth-year students believed knowing what to write should be subsumed by knowing how to write, and concentrated on the procedural aspect. They believed a coherent assignment resulted when students conceptualised subject matter in ways that enabled them to write academically.  Findings in this study extend recent reconceptualisations of literacy as 'literacies' and socio-cultural, socio-cognitive theories about literacy as social practice. They demonstrate limitations of an apprenticeship model for acculturation and suggest a more agentic role for novice members in accounting for learning outcomes as students develop as assignment writers. The experiential accounts reported by members of the academic writing community described their shared and idiosyncratic perceptions of literacy practices and relations of these practices with success in assignment writing. Their descriptions enhance our understanding of the complexity and consequences of these experiences. They also account for why calls for the community to be more visible and explicit in sharing communal expectations of what is privileged and valued in academic assignment writing generally may not be a solution. Based on findings here, this is not a solution. Expectations need to be co-constructed within the community, among students, and lecturers within the context of the writing task. An outcome of understandings reported here is the development of a model from which factors, conditions and critical events that situate learning within a rhetorical conundrum may be described and predicted.  This model offers a framework for members of a writing community to explicate individual experiences and expectations in ways that help everyone make sense of those critical events that contribute to a rhetorical conundrum and shape encultured knowledge.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">assignment writing</field><field name="subject">assignments</field><field name="subject">report writing</field><field name="subject">reports</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">undergraduate</field><field name="subject">student</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">undergraduates</field><field name="subject">academic writing</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040625.165808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children&#146;s cross-cultural literacy experiences in three worlds: Enacting agency</field><field name="creator">Fluckiger, Beverley</field><field name="description">The literacy experiences of a small group of culturally-diverse children were examined in this study.  The experiences, too, were diverse &#150; and influential.  The children, five girls aged four &#150; five years, attended the same Preschool, in an inner suburb of a large city in Australia.  Data were gathered at home, during the last two months of the preschool year and, for three of the children, during writing sessions in the first six months of Year One.  Vygotskian ideas on meaning-making were integrated with other perspectives on development, literacy learning and teaching from a sociocultural, theoretical framework.  The purpose was to identify dimensions of children&#146;s literacy experiences and provide insight into ways in which children negotiate culture, literacy, and schooling, challenge current perspectives, contribute to research knowledge and determine how teachers might take account of cultural diversity in classrooms to better support children in literacy learning. A grounded theory method was employed using multiple data collection tools and techniques in both home and school contexts.  Data were coded using a process of constant comparison to identify features, characteristics and dimensions of children&#146;s literacy experiences.  Independent inter-rater agreement on the coding of features at home, Preschool and school was 98.4%.  Findings included a variety of values, beliefs and perspectives amongst parents and between teachers in relation to literacy learning, roles and relationships, and home-school connections.  Children&#146;s literacy experiences at home differed in terms of nature, frequency and resources and experiences in each of the settings were very different.  A major finding was that children acted as agents of their own learning: mixing, transferring, trying out, adapting, and experimenting to determine appropriate practices and make decisions including when to exercise choice to enact agency.  These assimilation and accommodation adaptations were identified as akin to code-switching, labelled as culture-switching, and identified as areas requiring further research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">literacy experiences</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">cultural diversity</field><field name="subject">classroom</field><field name="subject">literacy learning</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Preschool</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070814.144647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Structural (Legislation and Policy), Professional and Process Factors on the Outcomes of Disciplinary Tribunals and Committees in Cases of Sexual Misconduct and Incompetent or Unsafe Practice</field><field name="creator">Forrester, Kim</field><field name="description">This study was conducted in the context of the regulation of professional nursing and midwifery practice in the Australian health care system. In this environment, professional regulatory authorities established by State and Territory legislation in all jurisdictions, regulate and control the work of health professionals. In Queensland, registered nurses, enrolled nurses and midwives are regulated by the Queensland Nursing Council, the statutory body created by the Nursing Act 1992 (Qld). Part of the regulatory role of this and other authorities is to discipline professionals whose conduct or behaviour falls short of appropriate and acceptable standards of practice. All regulated health professionals, including nurses and midwives, are potentially subject to professional disciplinary action if a complaint is lodged in relation to their conduct. This being an important issue in the management and delivery of health care, and an increased trend among health care consumers, the dearth of existing research into the disciplinary process is a major concern. This exploratory study examined the disciplinary role of the Queensland Nursing Council in adhering to its legislative mandate to ensure safe and competent nursing practice. The study focused on the extent to which structural (legislation and policy), professional, and process factors impacted on the outcomes of disciplinary Tribunals and Committees in cases of incompetent or unsafe practice and sexual misconduct. The study was situated within the interpretive paradigm using a case study approach. Specifically, it investigated cases of sexual misconduct by nurses and unsafe or incompetent practice by midwives. The study was guided by Donabedian's conceptual framework of structure-process-outcome. This framework was seen to be most suited to the aims of the study and provided a template for in-depth analysis of the data emerging from the two cases. The findings of this study provided insight into the factors underpinning the decisions of the disciplinary bodies in making determinations and formulating outcomes. There was found to be a lack of consistency and predictability in both the legislative frameworks and the interpretation of terms and concepts used to identify conduct warranting a disciplinary response from regulatory authorities. Although the processes of disciplinary proceedings are prescribed by both legislation and policy, their practical application was characterised by considerable challenges, which resulted in varying outcomes. The thesis reports this information so that it can be used as an initial basis to build a body of knowledge from practical experience with disciplinary proceedings that will inform future processes. Subsequent case studies in other contexts and systems will increase the level of knowledge available to nurses, other health care providers, health care institutions and regulatory authorities. The initial base of evidence suggests implications for practice, education and further research which are outlined in the final chapter of the thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">nurse</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">midwife</field><field name="subject">midwives</field><field name="subject">midwifery</field><field name="subject">professional</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">legal</field><field name="subject">legislation</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">disciplinary tribunals</field><field name="subject">sexual misconduct</field><field name="subject">incompetence</field><field name="subject">unsafe practice</field><field name="subject">complaints</field><field name="subject">complaint</field><field name="subject">proceedings</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040615.144659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Praxis of Theatre Directing: An Investigation of the Relationship Between Directorial Paradigms and Radical Group Theatre in Australia Since 1975</field><field name="creator">Foster, Michael E.</field><field name="description">The thesis investigates the field of Theatre practice variously referred to as alternative, non-mainstream, avant-garde, community or fringe theatre. I have suggested the term 'Radical Group Theatre' - a term which, I believe, best encompasses the sector formerly represented by this diverse body of theatre practice. I focus on the relationship between theoretical and practical paradigms, and debates surrounding them; theatre making processes; and directorial practice in a theatre form which has emerged as a distinctive set of characteristics, ideological frameworks and practices in the Australian context. The work is strongly informed by the perspectives and practices of a range of major contributors to the field. It notes the inadequacy of conventional analytics and established understandings of the theory/practice nexus for exploring Radical Group Theatre, and establishes an alternate set of frameworks. These enable fresh engagement with the development and current praxis of an important theatre form which has not previously been considered as a whole field yet has taken particularly exciting directions in Australia over the past three decades. Methodology and objectives: An important aspect of the study is the way in which the research methodology parallels the practice under investigation. That is, the practice of Radical Group Theatre in Australia mirrors the 'Reflective Reflexive Loop' which I propose as the pre-eminent principle of the praxis. The methodology has developed out of my Masters degree research which was an interrogation of my directorial practice in the field of Youth/Community theatre, 1976-1989. I was further interested to analyse the field of group theatre to determine whether common key principles identified as characteristics of the form in the earlier study constituted the basis for an analytical model  of Radical Group Theatre praxis. The investigation for this thesis began with a project designed to synthesise the essential qualities of directorial practice: the qualities of the good director, the major influences on practice, and the expectations participants have regarding the function of the director. The preliminary findings formed the basis for a comparative study which sought answers to the key questions as they apply to a pre-professional radical theatre setting - university student theatre. This project gave birth to the focus questions of the study which established the theoretical and methodological frames for the thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theatre</field><field name="subject">theater</field><field name="subject">alternative</field><field name="subject">radical</field><field name="subject">avant-garde</field><field name="subject">fringe</field><field name="subject">group</field><field name="subject">groups</field><field name="subject">radical group theatre</field><field name="subject">director</field><field name="subject">directors</field><field name="subject">directing</field><field name="subject">direction</field><field name="subject">theatrical</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">1970s</field><field name="subject">1980s</field><field name="subject">1990s</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040810.091417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mentoring relationships at work: An investigation of mentoring functions, benefits, and gender</field><field name="creator">Fowler, Jane</field><field name="description">The program of research reported here provides a contemporary view of mentoring relationships.  In particular, it presents a definition that reflects mentoring experiences in modern organisations, identifies mentoring functions and benefits as perceived by mentees and mentors, and examines the relationships between those constructs and gender. Forty-eight mentees and mentors from a range of organisations, representing all possible gender combinations of mentee-mentor, were interviewed about their mentoring experiences.  Content analysis of the interview data identified 42 categories of mentoring functions and 29 categories of benefits perceived by mentees and mentors.  The emergent categories of mentoring functions and benefits were used to construct measurement instruments. The instruments were then completed by 500 mentees and mentors, again representing all four gender combinations of mentee-mentor, from a range of organisations.  Principal components analyses revealed seven mentoring functions identified by mentees and eight by mentors.  Those functions were Personal and Emotional Guidance, Coaching/Learning Facilitation (identified as two separate functions by mentors), Advocacy, Role Modelling, Career Development Facilitation, Strategies and Systems Advice, and Friendship.  The study extended empirical research by identifying a range of distinct mentoring functions rather than the broad category approach adopted in previous research.  The principal components solutions generated separately for mentees and mentors were similar, indicating convergent views between the providers and recipients of these functions.  Several of the mentoring functions that emerged were similar to those identified by Kram (1980) and the emergence of new functions was interpreted in light of changes in organisations over the past 20 years and the recruitment of representative samples, in this study, that reflected those changes. Principal components analyses also revealed four mentoring benefits identified by mentees and five by mentors.  Benefits for mentees were Professional Enhancement, Interpersonal Relationship, Professional Induction/ Immersion, and Professional Reward.  By identifying the benefits that mentees themselves perceive as being attributable to their mentoring relationships, the current study extended empirical research on mentee benefits beyond, objective, traditionally measured outcome variables. Benefits for mentors were Professional Enhancement, Organisational and Peer Recognition, Interpersonal Relationship, Meaningfulness and Fulfillment, and Productivity.  The range of benefits that emerged reflects the importance mentees and mentors place on the psychological and interpersonal experiences of their mentoring relationships. The relationships between mentoring functions and benefits and gender were examined for both mentees and mentors.  Results indicate that gender effects are limited to only some mentoring functions and benefits.  Examination of the relationships between distinct mentoring functions and benefits indicated that specific mentoring functions are related to particular benefits for both mentees and mentors.  The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are provided.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mentoring</field><field name="subject">mentoring relationships</field><field name="subject">mentoring functions</field><field name="subject">mentoring benefits</field><field name="subject">gender and mentoring</field><field name="subject">mentors</field><field name="subject">mentees</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030226.074725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communicating the Australian Coast: Communities, Cultures and Coastcare</field><field name="creator">Foxwell-Norton, Kerrie-Ann</field><field name="description">In Australia, Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICM) is the policy framework adopted by government to manage the coastal zone. Amongst other principles, ICM contains an explicit mandate to include local communities in the management of the coastal zone. In Australia, the Coastcare program emerged in response to international acceptance of the need to involve local communities in the management of the coastal zone. This dissertation is a critical cultural investigation of the Coastcare program to discover how the program and the coastal zone generally, is understood and negotiated by three volunteer groups in SE Queensland. There is a paucity of data surrounding the actual experiences of Coastcare volunteers. This dissertation begins to fill this gap in our knowledge of local community involvement in coastal management.  My dissertation considers the culture of Coastcare and broadly, community participation initiatives. Coastcare participants, government policymakers, environmental scientists, etc bring to their encounter a specific &#145;way of seeing&#146; the coast &#150; a cultural framework &#150; which guides their actions, ideas and priorities for the coastal zone. These cultural frameworks are established and maintained in the context of unequal relations of power and knowledge. The discourses of environmental science and economics &#150; as evidenced in the chief ICM policy objective, Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) &#150; are powerful knowledges in the realm of community participation policy. This arrangement has serious consequences for what governments and experts can expect to achieve via community participation programs.  In short, the quest for &#145;power-sharing&#146; with communities and &#145;meaningful participation&#146; is impeded by dominant scientific and economic cultures which act to marginalise and discredit the cultures of communities (and volunteers). Ironically enough, the lack of consideration of these deeper relations of power and knowledge means that the very groups (such as policymakers, environmental scientists, etc) who actively seek the participation of local communities, contribute disproportionately to the relative failure of community participation programs. At the very least, as those in a position of power, policymakers and associated experts do little to enhance communication with local communities. To this situation add confusion wrought by changes in the delivery of the Coastcare program and a lack of human and financial resources. From this perspective, the warm and fuzzy sentiment of Coastcare can be understood as the &#145;Coastcare of neglect&#146;.  However, the emergence of community participation as &#145;legitimate&#146; in environmental policymaking indicates a fissure in the traditional power relations between communities and experts. Indeed the entry of &#145;community participation policy&#146; is relatively new territory for the environmental sciences. It is this fissure which I seek to explore and encourage via the application of a cultural studies framework which offers another &#145;way of seeing&#146; community participation in coastal and marine management and thereby, offers avenues to improve relations between communities and experts.  My fieldwork reveals a fundamental mismatch between the cultural frameworks which communities bring to the coast and those frameworks embodied and implemented by the Coastcare program. Upon closer examination, it is apparent that the Coastcare program (and community participation programs generally) are designed to introduce local &#145;lay&#146; communities to environmental science knowledge. Local coastal cultures are relegated to the personal and private realm. An excellent example of this is the scientifically oriented &#145;eligible areas for funding&#146; of the Coastcare program. The volunteers consulted for this project emphasized their motivation in terms of &#145;maintaining the natural beauty of the coast&#146; and &#145;protecting a little bit of coast from the rampant development of the coastal zone&#146;. Their motivations were largely the antithesis of ESD. They understood their actions as thwarting the negative impacts of coastal development &#150; this occurred within a policy framework which accepted development as fait d&#146;accompli.  Australia&#146;s nation of coastal dwellers may not know a lot about &#145;coastal ecologies&#146; but they do know the coast in other ways. Community knowledge of the coast can be largely accounted for in the phrase, &#145;Australian beach culture&#146;. Serious consideration of Australian beach culture in environmental policy is absent. The lack of attention to this central tenet of the Australian way of life is because, as a concept and in practice, beach culture lacks the &#145;seriousness&#146; and objectivity of environmental science knowledge &#150; it is about play, hedonism, holidays, spirituality, emotion and fun. The stories (including Indigenous cultural heritage) which emerge when Australians are asked about their &#145;beach cultural knowledge&#146; &#150; historical and contemporary experiences of the Australian coast &#150; await meaningful consideration by those interested in communicating with Australian communities living on the coast. This &#145;cultural geography&#146; is an avenue for policymakers to better communicate and engage with Australian communities in their quest to increase participation in, or motivate interest in community coastal management programs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrated Coastal Zone Management</field><field name="subject">ICM</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">South East Queensland</field><field name="subject">Coastcare</field><field name="subject">coastal zone</field><field name="subject">Ecologically Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">ESD</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070814.094758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Home Visiting as an Early Intervention Strategy for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Jennifer Anne</field><field name="description">Burgeoning numbers of child abuse and neglect reports throughout the developed world has prompted calls for preventive and early intervention measures to support and prepare families for parenting. Nurse home visiting is one form of service delivery gaining acceptance as an appropriate strategy. Although home visiting is not a new concept in service delivery, enthusiasm for home-visitation programmes has re-emerged not only in Australia in recent years, but in many other developed countries with initiatives being launched or recommended at state, national and international levels. This thesis presents a review of the tenets of home visiting and examines a home visiting intervention programme targeting children born into families with child abuse or neglect risk factors. A randomised controlled trial using a cohort of 181 families was undertaken to evaluate the impact of this home visiting programme. Mothers were recruited in the immediate postnatal period and allocated either into the home visiting programme or into a comparison group. The research design required self-identification into the study by providing positive responses to a range of risk factors. This procedure was shown to have utility in the context of recruitment to a research trial, in that respondents were willing to disclose sensitive personal issues using this form of screening as the basis for targeted intervention. The home visiting programme examined by this study was also shown to have social validity, with mothers willing to accept this form of intervention from the immediate postnatal period. High retention and satisfaction rates strengthened this conclusion. The ability of this study to evaluate the effectiveness of the home visiting intervention programme may have been compromised by a range of contextual factors influencing programme outcomes detailed in this thesis. Nonetheless, the study found that, for a group of families reporting risk factors for child abuse and neglect potential, provision of an intensive home visiting intervention using nurses, social workers, and parent aides was not effective in producing more favourable adjustment to the parenting role over time compared with nonintervention or clinic based service provision. The intervention programme group participants gained knowledge of child development and child management skills during the early postnatal weeks while the comparison group participants developed knowledge and skills later in the first year of their infant's lift. Early adaptation to the parenting role, parenting knowledge, and skill acquisition bodes well for parent-infant attachment and the children's long-term health and developmental outcomes. However, a 12-month assessment of maternal, family, and child development variables did not demonstrate maintenance of a positive intervention impact on parenting stress, parenting competence, or quality of the home environment. Finally, predictive analysis of fictors measured in the immediate postnatal period revealed an absence of any predictive value to demographic characteristics, which secondary prevention efforts typically target. These results not only demonstrate that there is a relationship between maternal, family and enviromnental factors identified in the immediate postnatal period, and adjustment to the parenting role, but also challenge demographic targeting for child abuse and neglect risk. Findings are discussed and placed within the context of previous research and reference is made to implications for future child health practice, development, and research. Recommendations arising from this discussion relate to both future research and community child health practice.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child abuse</field><field name="subject">home visiting</field><field name="subject">intervention programmes</field><field name="subject">community child health</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050915.140055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topical Talk in General Practice Medical Consultations: The Operation of Service Topics in the Constitution of Orderly Tasks, Patients and Service Providers</field><field name="creator">Freiberg, Jill Maree</field><field name="description">This research project addresses the following: how topical talk operates in the organisation and management of MSE interactions; and how topical talk operates in the co-ordination of specific service requests and service provisions. It draws on a corpus of audio-recorded and transcribed interactions between general practitioners and persons seeking general medical services in suburban clinics in Brisbane, Australia. The corpus comprised a total of 67 medical service events (henceforth MSEs), audio-taped with the full informed consent of the participants. Many contemporary medical sociological accounts of the operation of topical talk in MSEs, typified by the work of Mishler (1981, 1984) and Waitzkin (1991), remain anchored to the 'professional dominance' thesis (Freidson 1970a; 1970b), arguing for the fundamental conflict between two perspectives - lay and professional. Topical talk has been formulated as one expression of this conflict in 'doctor-centred' communicative 'styles' (Byrne and Long 1976; Silverman 1987). Within such accounts, familiar interactional patterns in MSEs, including the content and structure of topics, have been theorised as instruments of power and control whereby the dominance of specialised medical knowledge and expertise are established and maintained. Mishler's (1984) characterisation of the conflict between a biomedically oriented 'voice of medicine' used by professional physicians (henceforth GPs) and a 'voice of the lifeworld' used by persons seeking medical services (henceforth Ps) is an expression of the 'professional dominance' thesis. The voices are characterised as attesting to a fundamental, theoretically problematic, asymmetry of power relations between GPs and Ps, thereby reinforcing the ideological status of professionals in general and the medical profession in particular. Further, recommendations regarding correctives to 'professional dominance' centre on advice GPs to attend to the primacy of Ps' talk on their experiences of illnesses rather than apparently 'ignoring' or transforming these topics into biomedical accounts of disease.  This research project critiques this formulation of topical talk and the traditional theoretical and empirical bases on which it has drawn. This critique arises from the application of ethnomethodological approaches to the study of MSEs. Such approaches, as outlined in Chapters 2 and 3, are characterised by a number of conceptual and analytic premises: First, particular social structural features of social activities and the institutional contexts within which activities occur should not be assumed to be the primary criteria for judging the import and adequacy of situated action. Second, the parties to situated social events mutually constitute those events in the real world. Third, issues of agency are collaborative situated accomplishments such that the management of everyday social activities is accomplished by the people involved who show one another the rationalities of their actions as they assemble the familiar scenic features of those same institutional events (Garfinkel 1967; Sacks 1992a, 1992b). These assumptions have been applied in ethnomethodological analyses of social action, including the analysis of professional service encounters that have critiqued the 'professional dominance' thesis (Eglin and Wideman 1986; Sharrock 1979). The novelty of this study is the analysis of the operation of topic organisation as a phenomenon of order.  This study also draws on recommendations within Ethnomethodology (Hester &amp; Eglin 1997b; Watson 1997) that sequential and categorial organisations are mutually informative in the analysis of the rationality of situated social action. One of the particular contributions of this thesis is that it not only jointly applies both conversation analysis and membership categorisation analysis but also extends this recommendation to the inclusion of topic analysis as was originally provided for by Sacks (1992a , 1992b) and Garfinkel and Sacks (1970). Within this study a model of analysis has been constructed that has enabled the analytical consideration of four dimensions of social organisation: local sequential, extended sequential, topical and categorial organisations. The theoretical and empirical concepts of ethnomethodogical analysis have thus been developed and extended within this project.  The central findings of this study are that in institutional service events, the 'service topic' is both significant and consequential, and that persons constitute themselves as bona fide incumbents of the categories GP or P by attending to their actions as topically organised. The local adequacy of any particular interactional move (such as questioning-answering, greetings, the design of a topic proposal, etc) is shown to be referenced to the service topic. This study found no evidence of potential or actual "struggles" between the 'voice of the life-world and the voice of medicine'. Rather, this study finds routine recognition on the part of both Ps and GPs of the centrality of the service topic and, thereby, the service task, and no evidence of orientation to distinctive biographical contributions staged in competition with biomedically relevant service topics. It is found that Ps' biographical references were made in the context of an assembled service topic such that particular service tasks, however conventional, were constituted as both relevant and reasonable as medical goods and service for the specific service recipient and provider.  At the most general level, it is concluded that the service topic operates as a phenomenon of order in MSEs  where order, as defined by Garfinkel and Weider (1992: 202), refers to all of the rationalities evident in the generic features of institutional events and settings, that is, the situated logic and intelligibility as well as the procedures whereby they are constituted as recognisable social events. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings for the theorisation, policy-making, medical education, and practices of GPs and Ps within MSEs. Overall, the significance of this work for researchers into medical interactions is that the relevance of the service topic and its pervasive organisational consequences need to be considered analytically. A major outcome of this thesis is the establishment of a new order of interest within the study of institutional interactions. The project demonstrates the pervasive consequences of service topics and thus provides a step forward in the study of institutional service interactions and ways of theorising their rationality, a step that extends beyond social structural pre-theorisations of power and domination and also beyond interactional accounts of the primary relevance of turn taking structures.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">doctor</field><field name="subject">doctors</field><field name="subject">physician</field><field name="subject">physicians</field><field name="subject">patient</field><field name="subject">patients</field><field name="subject">doctor-patient</field><field name="subject">physician-patient</field><field name="subject">GPs</field><field name="subject">general practitioners</field><field name="subject">consultation</field><field name="subject">consultations</field><field name="subject">consulting</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">talk</field><field name="subject">talking</field><field name="subject">conversation</field><field name="subject">topical talk</field><field name="subject">professionals</field><field name="subject">professional dominance</field><field name="subject">ethnomethodology</field><field name="subject">MSE</field><field name="subject">MSEs</field><field name="subject">medical service events</field><field name="subject">service topic</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041012.125934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Reciprocal Relationship Between Conduct Problems, Callous Unemotional Traits, and Parenting Behaviour</field><field name="creator">Frost, Aaron Desmond James</field><field name="description">Callous and Unemotional (CU) traits are a relatively recent addition to the existing body of research examining the development of severe behavioural problems in children, and antisocial behaviour in adults. Children who are high in CU traits display shallow emotions, manipulate other children, lie easily, and demonstrate very little remorse or guilt. Additionally, they are more likely to engage in more severe forms of antisocial behaviour, more often, and from a younger age than their peers. Research has found that CU traits moderate the well-established relationship between parenting and conduct problems. That is, children who are high in CU traits seem to display levels of behaviour problems that are unrelated to the quality or type of parenting they receive. This has serious implications when one considers that the most effective psychosocial treatments available for behavioural disorders are based upon improving parenting, and would therefore require significant modification for children high in CU traits. In addition, the research exploring the moderating role of CU traits in the relationship between parenting and conduct problems has not taken a developmental perspective and considered different ages of children. Finally, existing research has not considered the reciprocal relationship that CU traits have upon parenting behaviour, or the direct relationship between parenting and CU traits. The present study has addressed these limitations by utilizing an accelerated longitudinal methodology. The present study recruited 449 grades one, three and five children from six public primary schools. Questionnaires assessing conduct problems, CU traits, and parenting styles were administered to their parents for completion. Additionally, teacher report was also sought on a number of key variables to ensure validity. One year later, all of these children and their families were re-approached to assess the extent to which each of these variables had changed over time. One year later 233 (51.89%) of the original sample completed the same measures allowing examination of the change in these variables over time. Given the relatively short time period, it was expected that one of the best predictors of any of the key variables at time 2, would be baseline scores measured at time 1. For this reason, hierarchical regression was used to control for temporal stability, as well as demographic factors. Additionally, the hypothesis that a different pattern of relationships would emerge for children of different ages was tested by examining the moderating effect of age upon all predictive relationships. This was done by entering the product of age and the predictor variable(s) as the final step of the regression analyses, and then conducting simple slopes analysis on all significant predictive interactions. Three distinct findings emerged from these analyses. Firstly, age moderates the effect of CU traits on the relationship between parenting styles and conduct problems. Behaviour problems in younger children are better predicted by parenting behaviours and by CU traits than in older children. Secondly, both CU traits and conduct problems were predictive of worsening parental behaviour. Once again, this was particularly evident in younger children. Finally, inconsistent parenting, and corporal punishment were found to be predictive of CU traits.

In this thesis I am going to try to provide new light on this debate by investigating dynamics under both the orthodox and modal interpretation. In particular I will answer the question what is the interpretation of non-Markovian stochastic Schrodinger equations? I conclude that under the orthodox view these equations have only a numerical interpretation. They provide a rule for calculating the state of the system at time t if we made a measurement on the bath (a collection of oscillators {ak}) at that time, yielding results {zk}. However in the modal view they have a meaning: non-Markovian stochastic Schrodinger equations represent the evolution of the system part of the property state of the universe (bath + system).</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-markovian stochastic Schrodinger equations</field><field name="subject">quantum mechanics</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040429.141303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Emotional Care For Childbearing Women: An Intervention Study</field><field name="creator">Gamble, Jennifer Anne</field><field name="description">Childbirth can be associated with short and long-term psychological morbidity including depression, anxiety and trauma symptoms. Some previous studies have used psychological interventions to reduce postpartum distress but have primarily focussed on attempting to relieve symptoms of depression with little recognition of trauma symptoms. Furthermore, the intervention used in these studies has generally been poorly documented. The first aim of the present study was to develop a counselling framework, suitable for use by midwives, to address psychological trauma following childbirth. Multiple methods were used to develop the intervention including focus groups with women and midwives. Both the women and midwives gave unequivocal support for postpartum debriefing. Themes that emerged from the focus groups with women included the need for opportunities to talk about their birth experience, an explanation of events, an exploration of alternative courses of action that may have resulted in a different birth experience, talking about their feelings such as loss, fear, anger and self-blame, discussing social support, and discussing possible future childbearing. There was a high level of agreement between the women's and midwives' views. These themes were synthesized with contemporary literature describing counselling interventions to assist in reconciling a distressing birth experience and a model for understanding women's distressing birth experiences to develop a counselling framework. The counselling intervention was then tested using a randomised controlled study involving 400 women recruited from antenatal clinics of three public hospitals. When interviewed within seventy-two hours of birth, 103 women reported a distressing birth experience and were then randomised into either the treatment or control group. Women in the intervention group had the opportunity to debrief at the initial postpartum interview (&lt; 72 hours postpartum) and at four to six weeks postpartum. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder was quite high; 9.6% of participants meeting the diagnostic criteria for acute PTSD at four to six weeks postpartum. Fewer participants (3.5%) met the diagnostic criteria for chronic PTSD at three months postpartum. As with previous research relating to childbearing women, few demographic factors or antenatal psychological factors were associated with the development of a PTSD symptom profile following childbirth. The development of PTSD symptom profile was strongly associated with obstetric intervention and a perception of poor care in labour. This finding is also consistent with previous research. Emotional distress was reduced for women in the intervention group in relation to the number of PTSD symptoms [t (101) = 2.144, p = .035], depression [c2 (1) = 9.188, p = .002], stress [c2 (1) = 4.478, p = .029] and feelings of self-blame [t (101) = -12.424, p &lt;.001]. Confidence about a future pregnancy was higher for these women [t (101) = -9.096, p &lt;.001]. Although there was not a statistically significant difference in the number of women with a PTSD symptom profile at three months postpartum, fewer women in the intervention group (n=3) than in the control group (n=9) met PTSD criteria. Likewise, there were fewer women in the intervention group (n=1) with anxiety levels above mild than in the control group (n=6). Importantly, this study found that offering women who have had a traumatic birth the opportunity for counselling using the framework documented in this dissertation was not harmful. This finding is in contrast to previous findings of other studies. The intervention was well received by participants. All the women in the intervention group found the counselling sessions helped them come to terms with their birth experience. Maternity service providers need to be cognizant of the prevalence of this debilitating condition and be able to identify women at risk for early intervention and referral to a mental health practitioner if appropriate. This research offers further support for the compelling need to implement changes to the provision of maternity services that reduce rates of obstetric intervention and humanise service delivery as a means of primary prevention of birth-related PTSD.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postpartum depression</field><field name="subject">post-partum depression</field><field name="subject">postnatal depression</field><field name="subject">post-natal depression</field><field name="subject">post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">PTSD</field><field name="subject">counselling</field><field name="subject">midwives</field><field name="subject">midwifery</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030904.154204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recasting Lin Shu: A Cultural Approach to Literary Translation</field><field name="creator">Gao, Wanlong</field><field name="description">This thesis is a re-evaluation of Lin Shu (1852-1924) and his literary translations. Lin Shu is one of China&#146;s most influential translators. He initiated modern literary translation in China, and his translations imported new ideas, literary concepts, styles and techniques from the West. These, in turn, influenced the emergence and development of modern Chinese literature. Nevertheless, Lin Shu and his translations have been belittled and even dismissed for various reasons over the years. The emergence and development of target/culture-oriented translation theories offer the possibility of re-assessing Lin Shu and his translations. The re-assessment of Lin Shu and his translations in this study is based on target/culture-oriented translation theories, which emerged in the 1970s. Target/culture-oriented translation theories focus on the mutual influence between a translation and its target culture, especially on the influence of a translation on the target culture and readers as a criterion for successful translation rather than examining whether the target text is faithful to the source text, as in the traditional linguistic approach. These target/culture-oriented theories can effectively explain the translational phenomenon of Lin Shu, as Lin Shu translated with the needs of the target culture and readers in mind. He attached great importance to the cultural function and influence of his translations during a period of historical transition in China. The criticisms of Lin Shu and his translations in China and elsewhere have largely been negative, often highlighting political issues - his endorsement of the constitutional Qing monarchy and his conservative attitude to the New Culture Movement - as well as his free translation method. Target/culture-oriented translation theories offer a framework for the re-assessment of Lin Shu and his translations that bypasses these narrow approaches. Adopting target/culture-oriented translation theories, this thesis examines Lin Shu&#146;s translations in a trans-cultural context. Lin Shu based his translations on the needs for the Chinese culture and readers of that time, which was clearly embodied in his choice of, and response to, the originals works. The prefaces and postscripts that he wrote for his translations illustrate the new cultural and literary factors that Lin Shu introduced into China. In this respect, Lin Shu&#146;s translation of La Dame aux Camelia is perhaps the most famous case study of his translation method. Through a comparative analysis of the Target Text (TT) and Source Text (ST), the thesis discusses the &#145;truthfulness&#146; of Lin Shu&#146;s translation, and stresses that &#145;truthfulness&#146; lies in seeking poetic equivalence rather than formal equivalence between the target and source texts. We argue that poetic equivalence is similar to Nida&#146;s principle of correspondence, but is beyond his dynamic equivalence. It lays special stress on literary or aesthetic equivalence. Poetic equivalence in Lin Shu&#146;s translations relates to the stylistic expression in China&#146;s literary language and is therefore intrinsic to sinicization. Lin Shu&#146;s skill in classical Chinese is central to our notion of poetic equivalence. However, I argue that Lin Shu&#146;s translation strategy is actually also beyond equivalence. It is primarily embodied in his constant adaptation of the original to the perceived needs of Chinese culture and the acceptability of his translations to Chinese readers. Adaptation includes omission, addition, alteration and abridgment. In terms of target/culture/reader-oriented translation theories, Lin Shu&#146;s adaptations were acceptable in the cultural context of his time. In brief, this study clarifies Lin Shu&#146;s contribution in introducing Western culture and literature into China. The study also stresses the cultural influence of Lin&#146;s translations on modern Chinese culture and on later generation of Chinese writers and translators. This thesis concludes that Lin Shu played a role of utmost importance in the establishment and evolution of early-modern and modern Chinese translation, particularly of modern literary translation in China. Therefore, Lin Shu is the father of modern Chinese literary translation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lin Shu</field><field name="subject">literary translation</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Chinese literature</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030731.161353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer Aided Text Analysis in Personnel Selection</field><field name="creator">Garrad, Mark</field><field name="description">This program of research was aimed at investigating a novel application of computer aided text analysis (CATA). To date, CATA has been used in a wide variety of disciplines, including Psychology, but never in the area of personnel selection. Traditional personnel selection techniques have met with limited success in the prediction of costly training failures for some occupational groups such as pilot and air traffic controller. Accordingly, the overall purpose of this thesis was to assess the validity of linguistic style to select personnel. Several studies were used to examine the structure of language in a personnel selection setting; the relationship between linguistic style and the individual differences dimensions of ability, personality and vocational interests; the validity of linguistic style as a personnel selection tool and the differences in linguistic style across occupational groups. The participants for the studies contained in this thesis consisted of a group of 810 Royal Australian Air Force Pilot, Air Traffic Control and Air Defence Officer trainees. The results partially supported two of the eight hypotheses; the other six hypotheses were supported. The structure of the linguistic style measure was found to be different in this study compared with the structure found in previous research. Linguistic style was found to be unrelated to ability or vocational interests, although some overlap was found between linguistic style and the measure of personality. In terms of personnel selection validity, linguistic style was found to relate to the outcome of training for the occupations of Pilot, Air Traffic Control and Air Defence Officer. Linguistic style also demonstrated incremental validity beyond traditional ability and selection interview measures.  The findings are discussed in light of the Five Factor Theory of Personality, and motivational theory and a modified spreading activation network model of semantic memory and knowledge. A general conclusion is drawn that the analysis of linguistic style is a promising new tool in the area of personnel selection.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">text analysis</field><field name="subject">computer aided text analysis</field><field name="subject">CATA</field><field name="subject">personnel selection</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">RAAF</field><field name="subject">pilot</field><field name="subject">pilots</field><field name="subject">air traffic control</field><field name="subject">air traffic controllers</field><field name="subject">Air Defence Officer</field><field name="subject">Air Defence Officers</field><field name="subject">Five Factor Theory of Personality</field><field name="subject">job aptitude</field><field name="subject">job ability</field><field name="subject">linguistic style</field><field name="subject">personality testing</field><field name="subject">vocational preference testing</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040408.093133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anticipatory Budgeting: A Long-Term Analysis of Old Age Pensions in Australia, Canada and Sweden</field><field name="creator">Gash, Alexander</field><field name="description">The impact of population ageing on the social budgets of the future is a phenomenon confronting many of the world's wealthiest and most advanced nations. The impending retirement of the 'baby boomers' has raised concerns about the inadequacy of budgetary frameworks (both conceptual and real) to fulfil the financial commitments of demographically sensitive programs, namely old age pensions. Pension schemes represent, by far, the largest social welfare commitment of first world nations. Old age pensions are also demographically sensitive. Furthermore, pension systems play a crucial role in alleviating poverty, in recognising the previous contribution of an individual and in maintaining of the social and economic wellbeing of democratic polities. The financial stability of pension schemes and the ability of governments to meet future commitments will become significant issues of public policy as the pressures from population ageing intensify. Yet, committing resources, or budgeting, for longer-term pressures is an inherently problematic exercise both from an intellectual and a practical perspective. For long-term resourcing to be successful it requires perfect foresight and a level of political commitment that typically eludes most politicians and governments. Longer or medium-term budgetary pressures are often ignored or avoided until they impact on the immediate chances of either fiscal or electoral success. As such, societies face the prospect of looming financial burdens, but only have a box of short-term tools at their disposal and a limited body of scholarship to guide them through this ticking political 'time bomb'. This research tackles a significant omission in the existing literature on budgeting, public policy and social welfare, by proposing a conceptual framework for the anticipation, conceptualisation and analysis of future budget pressures. In doing so, it brings together analytical frameworks of government budgeting and social policy from a number of disciplinary areas and weaves them into a conceptual framework that allows for diagnostic and prescriptive analysis of budgetary pressures within a particular policy/spending area. The framework is also compatible with existing budgetary frameworks and decision-making processes. Through the analysis of the old age pension systems in Australia, Canada and Sweden this thesis makes an important contribution to the understanding of how demographic transition will impact on the future stability of pension schemes. The thesis contends that ageing populations will place significant pressure on each pillar of the pension system to meet its future financial commitments. This pressure will, in turn, have important implications for national budgetary processes and old age pension policy over the coming decades. In particular, governments will be required to implement a range of techniques that sit both within and beyond the traditional bounds of most budget processes. It will be imperative for researchers to explore the complexities and political possibilities of budget reform and to search for ways in which the longer-term needs of society can be adequately satisfied through the budget process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anticipary budgeting</field><field name="subject">baby boomers</field><field name="subject">old age pensions</field><field name="subject">social budgets</field><field name="subject">pension schemes</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061109.103403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dioxins in the Marine Environment: Sources, Pathways and Fate of Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins and Dibenzofurans in Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Gaus, Caroline</field><field name="description">Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans(PCDFs) are two groups of lipophilic, persistent organic pollutants that are produced as by-products of various anthropogenic and industrial processes. Due to their relatively high toxic potencies and potential to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in organisms and through the food chain, the contemporary widespread distribution of these compounds is a concern to the health of the environment, wildlife and humans. This study determined the distribution, pathways and fate of PCDD/Fs in the coastal zone of Queensland, Australia, including the inshore marine environment of the World Heritage Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This ecosystem supports unique fauna and flora such as the marine herbivorous mammal dugong (Dugong dugon) and its food source, seagrass. Elevated PCDD/Fs were present in soils and sediments along the entire Queensland coastline. Highest concentrations were found in soil from agricultural irrigation drains and in sediments near the mouths of major rivers. Elevated concentrations were associated with rural and urban types of land-use, and PCDD/Fs were present even in locations remote from anthropogenic activities. PCDD/F congener-specific analysis revealed an unusual profile in all samples, dominated by OCDD, with PCDFs present in low concentrations or below the limit of detection. Distinct HxCDD isomer patterns were observed, with the 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD/1,2,3,4,6,7-HxCDD isomer pair dominating the 2,3,7,8-substituted HxCDDs. Similar congener and isomer characteristics were reported in sediments, soil and clay samples from other continents, but could not be attributed to any known source. Possible PCDD/F sources in Queensland were assessed using segmented estuarine sediment cores, for which radiochemical chronologies were established for each depth. Variations of PCDD/F concentrations in the sediment cores over several centuries of depositional history were relatively small. Elevated PCDD levels were still present in sediment slices from the early 17th century. PCDD/F homologue profiles in sediments deposited during the last 350 years were almost identical and correlated well to the characteristic profiles observed in surface sediments and soils from the entire Queensland coastline. These results suggested the presence of an unidentified PCDD source prior to the production of commercial organochlorine products. To investigate the formation of the unusual PCDD/F profiles, congener and isomer specific analyses were undertaken in soils, sediments and dated sediment cores. The results demonstrated that specific transformation processes in the environment have resulted in the observed PCDD profile characteristics. Dechlorination of OCDD was proposed to result in distinct 1,4-pattern characteristics (i.e. formation of isomers chlorinated in the 1,4,6,9-positions). Consequently, the environmental samples do not reflect the signatures of the original source. An alternative hypothesis to natural formation is discussed evaluating these processes and their implications for possible source contributions. This hypothesis explores the potential for the influence of anthropogenic PCDD precursors (e.g. pentachlorophenol) during the 1940s to 1990s. Transport of PCDD/Fs from the land-based source via impacted tributary river systems, and subsequent deposition processes are proposed to result in PCDD/F accumulation in the inshore marine ecosystem. The extent of the sediment PCDD/F contamination governs the concentrations in the extensive inshore marine seagrass meadows of Queensland. Partitioning processes in the sediment-seagrass system lead to increased toxic equivalency (TEQ) in the seagrass, compared to sediment.The relationship between contaminated inshore sediments, seagrass and dugongs were evaluated using six dugong habitat regions along the coastline. PCDD/F body burdens in dugongs are governed by sediment (and seagrass) PCDD/F concentrations in their habitat. High seagrass (and incidental sediment) ingestion rates, selective retention of toxicologically potent congeners and relatively low PCDD/F elimination capacities in dugongs are proposed to result in elevated PCDD/F concentrations and TEQ levels in adult animals. Transfer efficiencies of 4 and 27% of maternal TEQ levels to foetuses and calves (respectively) during gestation and lactation result in relatively high exposure potentials to offspring. Compared to no-observed-adverse-effect-levels in other mammals, and based on the results of this study, a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 10-24 pg TEQ kg-1 day-1 was estimated for dugongs. The results of the present study found that dugongs from some regions along the coastline of Queensland exceed this TDI by up to 20 fold, suggesting that these populations may be at risk from PCDD/F contamination in their habitat. These results have important implications for the health of the environment, wildlife and humans and were used to develop a conceptual understanding of the sources, pathways and fate of dioxins in Queensland, Australia.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dioxin</field><field name="subject">dioxins</field><field name="subject">polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins</field><field name="subject">PCDD</field><field name="subject">PCDDs</field><field name="subject">polychlorinated dibenzofurans</field><field name="subject">PCDF</field><field name="subject">PCDFs</field><field name="subject">marine pollution</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="subject">seagrass</field><field name="subject">seagrasses</field><field name="subject">dugong</field><field name="subject">dugongs</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030624.144111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Novel Hybrid Learning Algorithm For Artificial Neural Networks</field><field name="creator">Ghosh, Ranadhir</field><field name="description">Last few decades have witnessed the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) in many real-world applications and have offered an attractive paradigm for a broad range of adaptive complex systems. In recent years ANN have enjoyed a great deal of success and have proven useful in wide variety pattern recognition or feature extraction tasks. Examples include optical character recognition, speech recognition and adaptive control to name a few. To keep the pace with its huge demand in diversified application areas, many different kinds of ANN architecture and learning types have been proposed by the researchers to meet varying needs. A novel hybrid learning approach for the training of a feed-forward ANN has been proposed in this thesis. The approach combines evolutionary algorithms with matrix solution methods such as singular value decomposition, Gram-Schmidt etc., to achieve optimum weights for hidden and output layers. The proposed hybrid method is to apply evolutionary algorithm in the first layer and least square method (LS) in the second layer of the ANN. The methodology also finds optimum number of hidden neurons using a hierarchical combination methodology structure for weights and architecture. A learning algorithm has many facets that can make a learning algorithm good for a particular application area. Often there are trade offs between classification accuracy and time complexity, nevertheless, the problem of memory complexity remains. This research explores all the different facets of the proposed new algorithm in terms of classification accuracy, convergence property, generalization ability, time and memory complexity.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">ANN</field><field name="subject">ANNs</field><field name="subject">feed-forward ANNs</field><field name="subject">learning algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030808.162355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art and Citizenship- Governmental Intersections</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Lisanne</field><field name="description">The thesis argues that the relations between culture and government are best viewed through an analysis of the programmatic and institutional contexts for the use of culture as an interface in the relations between citizenship and government. Discussion takes place through an analysis of the history of art programmes which, in seeking to target a 'general' population, have attempted to equip this population with various particular capacities. We aim to provide a history of rationalities of art administration. This will provide us with an approach through which we might understand some of the seemingly irreconcilable policy discourses which characterise contemporary discussion of government arts funding. Research for this thesis aims to make a contribution to historical research on arts institutions in Australia and provide a base from which to think about the role of government in culture in contemporary Australia. In order to reflect on the relations between government and culture the thesis discusses the key rationales for the conjunction of art, citizenship and government in post-World War Two (WWII) Australia to the present day. Thus, the thesis aims to contribute an overview of the discursive origins of the main contemporary rationales framing arts subvention in post-WWII Australia. The relations involved in the government of culture in late eighteenth-century France, nineteenth-century Britain, America in the 1930s and Britain during WWII are examined by way of arguing that the discursive influences on government cultural policy in Australia have been diverse. It is suggested in relation to present day Australian cultural policy that more effective terms of engagement with policy imperatives might be found in a history of the funding of culture which emphasises the plurality of relations between governmental programmes and the self-shaping activities of citizens. During this century there has been a shift in the political rationality which organises government in modern Western liberal democracies. The historical case studies which form section two of the thesis enable us to argue that, since WWII, cultural programmes have been increasingly deployed on the basis of a governmental rationality that can be described as advanced or neo-liberal. This is both in relation to the forms these programmes have taken and in relation to the character of the forms of conduct such programmes have sought to shape in the populations they act upon. Mechanisms characteristic of such neo-liberal forms of government are those associated with the welfare state and include cultural programmes. Analysis of governmental programmes using such conceptual tools allows us to interpret problems of modern social democratic government less in terms of oppositions between structure and agency and more in terms of the strategies and techniques of government which shape the activities of citizens. Thus, the thesis will approach the field of cultural management not as a field of monolithic decision making but as a domain in which there are a multiplicity of power effects, knowledges, and tactics, which react to, or are based upon, the management of the population through culture. The thesis consists of two sections. Section one serves primarily to establish a set of historical and theoretical co-ordinates on which the more detailed historical work of the thesis in section two will be based. We conclude by emphasising the necessity for the continuation of a mix of policy frameworks in the construction of the relations between art, government and citizenship which will encompass a focus on diverse and sometimes competing policy goals.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">citizenship</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Art and state</field><field name="subject">Cultural policy</field><field name="subject">Arts -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Federal aid to the arts -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Cultural policy</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Cultural policy -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030226.085219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">English in China: The Impact of the Global Language on China's Language Situation</field><field name="creator">Gil, Jeffrey Allan</field><field name="description">The language situation of today's world is drastically different from that which existed in the past. English has become the global language -it is used more and is more widespread than any other language has ever been. At the same time we are faced with large-scale language endangerment which could result in the extinction of half or more of the world's languages.  While not the only reason for language endangerment, the status of English as the global language has important consequences for all other languages and therefore deserves to be studied carefully. However, exactly what English means for other languages and cultures is far from simple and there is no general agreement on this issue. English has been seen as a destructive language, a pluralistic language and as an irrelevant language. This thesis explores the issue of global English as it applies to China. English language learning and teaching has been, and by all indications will continue to be, an important part of China's reform and modernisation. China is also an ethnically and linguistically diverse country with 55 minority nationalities and over 80 languages. What does the spread of English mean for China's language situation? Drawing on data gained through fieldwork and published sources, I argue that English in China is multifaceted, that is it has destructive, pluralistic and irrelevant elements. English is now used more and has higher status in China than at any time in the past and this has raised some concerns. However, English is not displacing Chinese language or culture. English is actually taking on Chinese features in both form and function. The Chinese language, far from being threatened, is currently expanding both in China and the world at large. Much effort has gone into promoting putonghua and there is great interest in learning Chinese in many parts of the world. China's minority languages, like those elsewhere, are under varying degrees of threat. However, English is not the main reason for this situation. At the present time at least it has relatively little presence in minority areas. Despite the fact that it is not destroying China's languages and cultures, English remains a significant issue for China and must be dealt with thoughtfully and carefully, especially among the minority nationalities. I argue that it is possible for China to acquire English without losing its linguistic diversity. Whether this can be achieved is a question of the resources and political will required to do so rather than any inherent difficulty with speaking two or more languages. To this end, the Context Approach is put forward as a possible way to improve English language teaching and learning among the minorities. In light of the results of this study, I suggest new directions for research, both on language issues in China and in general. I also argue for a new approach to our study of English as a global language and language endangerment. We need to appreciate the complexities of English on a local level as well as a global level and focus our attention more on how English can be taught to speakers of endangered languages in such a way that does not lead to language loss.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global language</field><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">Chinese language</field><field name="subject">language endangerment</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060105.113942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Predictors of Resilience in Operating Room Nurses</field><field name="creator">Gillespie, Brigid Mary</field><field name="description">The nursing workforce has experienced considerable change during the previous decade, resulting in a chronic shortage of nurses. Issues such as economic rationalism, increased workloads, changes in nursing education and the advancing age of the current nursing workforce are the chief contributors to this shortage (Australian Institute of Health &amp; Welfare, 2005b; Buerhaus, Staiger, &amp; Auerbach, 2000b). Operating room (OR) nursing is a primary specialty area that has been especially affected by rising nurse attrition and a reduction in nurse recruitment (Australian College of Operating Room Nurses, 2003; Australian Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2002). Accordingly, the loss of skilled nurses from the OR specialty compounds the negative effects on morale for those who remain in the environment, as they struggle to provide safe patient care while concomitantly being responsible for the clinical development of neophyte and inexperienced nurses (Australian Health Workforce Advisory Committee, 2002; Arndt, 1998). In the midst of working in the OR environs where the nature of the associated stressors is unique, resilient qualities may assist nurses to meet and overcome these challenges. If there is to be a continued nursing presence in the OR, it is essential that nurses be given the opportunity to develop resilience. At this time when nurse retention rates are continuing to decline steadily, there is a compelling need to identify and describe the relationship between resilience and its predictors in the context of the OR. To date, little is known about predictors of resilience and their potential to ameliorate the effects of workplace stress in the OR.  The overall purpose of this study was to identify and describe the predictors of resilience in OR nurses. A literature review and concept analysis of resilience was initially conducted. Hope, self-efficacy, coping and personal characteristics were identified as defining characteristics of resilience. Next, the research was conducted as a mixed method phased study that was underpinned by the pragmatist paradigm, and employed a sequenced combination of qualitative followed by quantitative inquiry (Morgan, 1998). The first phase used a mini-ethnography to identify and describe the components of workplace culture in an OR in relation to their potential impact on nurses&#146; ability to adapt in this culture. A triangulated approach was used involving participant observation, a reflective journal, field notes and interviews. This phase revealed that competence, knowledge, collaboration, peer support and the ability to manage challenges were central components of OR workplace culture. From these categories, three themes were abstracted and subsequently developed into constructs that were measured and validated in the larger second phase.  The second phase used a predictive correlation survey to describe empirically the relationship between resilience and its hypothesised predictors in a systematic random national sample of nurses who were members of the Australian College of Operating Room Nurses (ACORN), and a combined sample of hospital nurses purposively drawn from two similar hospital sites. The survey included scales measuring perceived competence, collaboration, managing stress, self-efficacy, hope, coping, and resilience, as well as gathering information about the demographic characteristics of nurse respondents.  Out of a total potential sample of 1,730 OR nurses, the overall response rate was 51.7% (n = 896). Differences between the ACORN and hospital samples were found in age, years of experience, education and years of employment; therefore, the national and hospital samples&#146; findings were analysed separately. Five independent variables &#150; hope, self-efficacy, coping, managing stress and competence &#150; predicted resilience in the larger sample of ACORN respondents (n = 772). For the substantially smaller sample of hospital respondents (n = 124), hope, self-efficacy and managing stress predicted resilience. Given that the smaller hospital sample resulted in a similar model, this consistency lends strength and weight to the revised resilience model. Over 60% of the variance in resilience was explained by the independent variables in each model. Given the dearth of literature describing the efficacy of resilience in ameliorating stress in OR contexts, the results of this study have extended the theoretical application of the resilience concept to include a nursing context. There is a need to implement resilience-building strategies that address the culture of the OR, both at the departmental and organisational levels. Strategies that provide a supportive workplace environment in relation to goal-orientation, the provision of stress management and education programs, and strategies that facilitate cultural assimilation may improve resilience, and hence retention and recruitment rates in the OR. The findings of this study support the need for further research not only to test the stability of the proposed model among other groups of nurses but also to explore further predictors of resilience in the OR setting.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing workforce</field><field name="subject">Operating Room</field><field name="subject">OR</field><field name="subject">Nurses</field><field name="subject">shortage of nurses</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070824.123750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collision Avoidance Systems for Mine Haul Trucks and Unambiguous Dynamic Real Time Single Object Detection</field><field name="creator">Glynn, Patrick Joseph</field><field name="description">A suite of new collision avoidance systems (CAS) is presented for use in heavy vehicles whose structure and size necessarily impede driver visibility is introduced.  The main goal of the project is to determine the appropriate use of each of the commercially available technologies and, where possible, produce a low cost variant suitable for use in proximity detection on large mining industry haul trucks.  CAS variants produced were subjected to a field demonstration and, linked to the output from the earlier CAS 1 project, (a production high-definition in-cabin video monitor and r/f tagging system). The CAS 2 system used low cost Doppler continuous wave radar antennae coupled to the CAS 1 monitor to indicate the presence of an object moving at any speed above 3 Km/h relative to the antennae. The novelty of the CAS 3 system lies in the design of 3 interconnected, modules.  The modules are 8 radar antennae (as used in CAS 2) modules located on the truck, software to interface with the end user (i.e. the drivers of the trucks) and a display unit.  Modularisation enables the components to be independently tested, evaluated and replaced when in use. The radar antennae modules and the system as a whole are described together with the empirical tests conducted and results obtained.  The tests, drawing on Monte-Carlo simulation techniques, demonstrate both the 'correctness' of the implementations and the effectiveness of the system.  The results of the testing of the final prototype unit were highly successful both as a computer simulation level and in practical tests on light vehicles.  A number of points, (as a consequence of the field test), are reviewed and their application to future projects discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collision avoidance systems</field><field name="subject">mine haul trucks</field><field name="subject">Doppler continuous wave antennae</field><field name="subject">unambiguous dynamic real time single object detection</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060809.163025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nature as Other: The Legal Ordering of the Natural World: Natural Heritage Law and Its Intersection With Property Law and Native Title</field><field name="creator">Godden, Lee</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the legal ordering of the natural environment represents a culturally contingent 'order of things'. Within this process of categorisation, Nature is constructed as an 'other' to the human subject. This opposition allows nature to be conceived as either an object of control, as found in property law, or as a wilderness to be preserved apart from human society. This latter view is implicit to the principles informing early environmental laws for the protection of natural heritage in international law and within Australia. More recently, this distinctively western legal ordering has been challenged to be more culturally inclusive and to include concepts that incorporate human interaction with the natural environment. In making this argument, the thesis adopts a theoretical framework derived from Foucault's 'Order of Things'. Modem western understanding of the natural environment is directly informed by western science. Scientific discourses, with origins in the Enlightenment, have been extremely influential in determining the legal ordering of the natural environment. In this context, the thesis provides an overview of the conceptual shift from a pre-scientific, organic conception of the relationship between people and nature to a people/nature dichotomy that persists as the nature/culture meta-narrative in modern society. The rise of a more holistic conception of the natural environment, based in ecological principles, has only partially displaced the latter view. The thesis also examines the manner in which property law constitutes the 'proper' order of the natural world within western culture. The bundle of rights concept, implicit to modern conceptions of property, finds resonances in western scientific understanding of the natural world. In particular, property law replicates the subject /object distinction that is central to modern western thought. The positing of nature as an object of control through the property relationship has been a resilient ordering of the natural environment. It has directly contributed to an instrumental perception of the natural environment. Indeed, the property concept was the central way of 'constructing' the Australian natural environment at law from colonisation to well into the twentieth century. The initial legal designation of Australia as 'terra nullius' allowed received English property law to form the template for ordering the occupation of the Australian natural environment by British civilisation. In the second half of the 20th century the wilderness ideal, in concert with ecological 'balance' concepts, gained currency in international and domestic law as the foundation for the protection of natural heritage. Natural heritage protection was a high profile aspect of early environmental laws in Australia. Thus the World Heritage Convention assumed an importance for natural heritage protection within Australia due to specific historical, political and constitutional factors. The adoption of 'holistic' definitions of environment in many pieces of Australian legislation has served to partially displace the instrumental, proprietary view of nature. However, the legal recognition of natural heritage, when based around wilderness ideals, remains predicated upon the western people/nature dichotomy. More recently, reforms to early environmental laws have been instituted and case law reveals a state of flux in how natural heritage areas are to be identified and valued. The traditional western legal constructions of nature have served to occlude Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander peoples' relationships with 'country'. Such legal frameworks continue to be problematic if a more culturally inclusive and holistic conception of heritage, such as cultural landscapes, is to be adopted. Further, while the recognition of native title has led to a re-examination of many fundamental legal principles, reexamination of our western legal constructs remains incomplete. One of the crucial areas yet to be fully worked through is how to accommodate western dualistic notions of the relationship between people and the natural environment with the legal requirements to establish native title. The need for accommodation has direct practical ramifications in that many world heritage, national estate and other 'wilderness' areas are, or may be, subject to native title claims. Therefore, the thesis considers the need to re-assess western, scientifically derived conceptions of natural heritage as the prevailing principles for environmental preservation. Finally the thesis discusses the contingency of any legal ordering of the natural world. Western representations of nature have exerted tremendous influence upon the legal regimes that have regulated and ordered nature across the Australian continent. These classifications are embedded within a particular cultural narrative. Parts of the Australian natural environment that are designated as property, as natural heritage, as native title, or as cultural heritage do not achieve this legal characterisation due to any inherent value or features of the natural environment itself. These areas are not necessarily property or heritage or native title until incorporated within, or recognised by, western legal frameworks. As such, any decision to ascribe a given legal status to the natural environment as part of the legal ordering needs to be seen as involving issues of choice that have direct distributive justice implications.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental law</field><field name="subject">order of things</field><field name="subject">property law</field><field name="subject">natural heritage</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050831.095124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Voices of the Volunteers: An Exploration of the Influences That Volunteer Experiences Have on the Resilience and Sustainability of Catchment Groups in Coastal Queensland</field><field name="creator">Gooch, Margaret Jennifer</field><field name="description">Research was undertaken for this thesis to uncover characteristics of resilient volunteers and stewardship groups, both of which are a major element of the social mobilisation strategy used in Australia to manage natural resources. The ability of volunteers and groups to overcome problems, deal with new issues as they arise, and keep going under pressure is termed 'resilience'. A 'resilience management' approach to natural resource management uses the idea of 'adaptive change' or panarchy to understand the development of resilience and thus, sustainability in human communities. According to this theory, sustainable communities are both changeable and stable, adapting to new situations as they arise. The research approach used in the study is called 'phenomenography'. It is an interpretive approach, based on the central assumption that there is variation in the ways in which people experience the same phenomenon. Phenomenography was used to see if lessons about resilience and sustainability could be learnt from catchment volunteers. All participants were 'catchment volunteers' working along the east coast of Queensland. They were drawn from a variety of organisations and programs including Landcare; Coastcare; Bushcare; Greening Australia; Waterwatch; treeplanting groups; and Integrated Catchment Management Committees. A total of 26 personal and group interviews involving 85 participants were conducted. Interviews comprised a series of semi-structured questions that were tape-recorded, then transcribed verbatim. Through a process of comparing and contrasting themes in the transcriptions, six conceptions emerged. These were: catchment volunteering was experienced as seeking and maintaining balance; developing/maintaining an identity; empowerment; learning; networking; and sustainable. Analysis of these themes was used to develop a model of catchment volunteer experiences depicting relationships between conceptions (termed the 'Outcome Space' in phenomenography). In this study the Outcome Space emerged as a set of scales, signifying the importance of keeping a balanced perspective on volunteering - a balance between things such as personal goals and organisational goals; between dedication to an unpaid vocation and family life; and between social benefits and environmental benefits. From the Outcome Space, several conceptual and practical outcomes were developed. These included: a typology of participation based on volunteer experiences; a table describing forms of empowerment in catchment volunteering; a table listing drivers for catchment volunteers; an illustration of Holling and Gunderson's adaptive cycle as it applies to stewardship groups; a table of factors that enhance the resilience and sustainability of stewardship groups; a model of the relationship between external pressures and resilient, sustainable stewardship groups; and guidelines for developing resilient sustainable stewardship groups. These outcomes contribute to an understanding of individual, group and community level responses to environmental issues; and how resilience can be developed in volunteers and stewardship groups and programs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">volunteer</field><field name="subject">volunteers</field><field name="subject">volunteering</field><field name="subject">voluntarism</field><field name="subject">stewardship</field><field name="subject">NRM</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">natural resource management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">resilience</field><field name="subject">resilient</field><field name="subject">resilience management</field><field name="subject">adaptive change</field><field name="subject">panarchy</field><field name="subject">phenomenography</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">sustainable</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="subject">landcare</field><field name="subject">catchment management</field><field name="subject">participants</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040804.150007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Loci for Paget's Disease of Bone</field><field name="creator">Good, David Andrew</field><field name="description">Paget's disease of the bone is a skeletal disorder of unknown cause.  This disease is characterised by excessive and abnormal bone remodelling brought about by increased bone resorption followed by disorganised bone formation.  Increased bone turnover results in a disorganised mosaic of woven and lamellar bone at affected skeletal sites.  This produces bone that is expanded in size, less compact, more vascular, and more susceptible to deformity or fracture than normal bone.  Symptoms of Paget's disease may include bone pain, bone deformity, excessive warmth over bone from hypervascularity, secondary arthritis, and a variety of neurologic complications caused in most instances by compression of the neural tissues adjacent to pagetic bone. Genetic factors play a role in the pathogenesis of Paget's disease but the molecular basis remains largely unknown.  The identification of the molecular basis of Paget's disease is fundamental for an understanding of the cause of the disease, for identifying subjects at risk at a preclinical stage, and for the development of more effective preventive and therapeutic strategies for the management of the condition.  With this in mind, the aim of this project is to identify genetic loci, in a large pedigree, that may harbour genes responsible for Paget's disease of bone. A large Australian family with evidence of Paget's disease was recruited for these studies (Chapter 3).  This pedigree has characterised over 250 individuals, with 49 informative individuals affected with Paget's disease of bone, 31 of whom are available for genotypic analysis.  The pattern of disease in these individuals is polystotic, with sites of involvement including the spine, pelvis, skull and femur.  Although the affected individuals have a severe early-onset form of the disease, the clinical features of the pedigree suggest that the affected family members have Paget's disease and not familial expansile osteolysis (a disease with some similarities to Paget's disease), as our patients have extensive skull and axial skeletal involvement.  The disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait in the pedigree with high penetrance by the sixth decade.  Due to the large size of this family and multiple affected members, this pedigree is a unique resource for the detection of the susceptibility gene in Paget's disease.   The first susceptibility loci for Paget's disease of bone have been mapped by other investigators to chromosome 6p21 (PDB1) and 18q21.1-q22 (PDB2) in different pedigrees.  Linkage analysis of the Australian pedigree in these studies was performed with markers at PDB1: these data showed significant exclusion of linkage, with LOD scores &lt; - 2 in this region (Chapter 4).  Linkage analysis of microsatellite markers from the PDB2 region excluded linkage with this region also, with a 30 cM exclusion region (LOD score &lt; -2.0) centred on D18S42 (Chapter 4).  This locus on chromosome 18q21.1-q22 contains a serine protease (serpin) cluster with similarities to chromosome 6p21.  Linkage analysis of this region also failed to provide evidence of linkage to this locus (Chapter 4).  These data are consistent with genetic heterogeneity of Paget's disease of bone.  A gene essential for osteoclast formation encoding receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB (RANK), TNFRSF11A, has been previously mapped to the PDB2 region.  Mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene have been identified segregating in pedigrees with Familial Expansile Osteolysis and early onset familial Paget's disease, however, linkage studies and mutation screening have excluded the involvement of RANK in the majority of Paget's disease patients.  For the Australian pedigree, mutation screening at the TNFRSF11A locus revealed no mutations segregating with affected individuals with Paget's disease (Chapter 4).  Based on these findings, our hypothesis is that a novel susceptibility gene relevant to the pathogenesis of Paget's disease of bone lies elsewhere in the genome in the affected members of this pedigree; this gene should be identifiable using a microsatellite genome-wide scan followed by positional cloning. A genome-wide scan of the Australian pedigree was carried out, followed by fine mapping and multipoint analysis in regions of interest (Chapter 5).  The peak 2-point LOD scores from the genome-wide scan were LOD = 2.75 at D7S507 and LOD = 1.76 at D18S70.  Two additional regions were also considered for fine mapping: chromosome 19p11-q13.1 with a LOD of 1.58 and chromosome 5q35-qter with a LOD of 1.57.  Multipoint and haplotype analysis of markers flanking D7S507 did not support linkage to this region (Chapter 5).  Similarly, fine mapping of chromosome 19p11-q13.1 failed to support linkage to this region (Chapter 5).  Linkage analysis with additional markers in the region on chromosome 5q35-qter revealed a peak multipoint LOD score of 6.77 (Chapter 5).  A distinct haplotype was shown to segregate with all members of the family, except the offspring of III-5 and III-6.  Haplotype analysis of markers flanking D18S70 demonstrated a haplotype segregating with Paget's disease in a large sub-pedigree (descendants of III-3 and III-4) (Chapter 5).  This sub-pedigree had a significantly lower age at diagnosis than the rest of the pedigree (51.2 + 8.5 vs. 64.2 + 9.7 years, p = 0.0012).  Linkage analysis of this sub-pedigree demonstrated a peak two-point LOD score of 4.23 at marker D18S1390 (q = 0.00), and a peak multipoint LOD score of 4.71, at marker D18S70.  An implication of these data is that 18q23 harbours a novel modifier gene for reducing the age of onset of Paget's disease of bone. A number of candidate Paget's genes have previously been identified on chromosome 18q23, including the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1), membrane-associated guanylated kinase (MAGUK) and a zinc finger protein. Candidate gene sequencing of these genes in these studies has failed to identify mutations segregating with affected family members in the sub-pedigree linked to chromosome 18q23 (Chapter 6).  More recently, a mutation in the gene encoding the ubiquitin-binding protein sequestosome 1 (SQSTM/p62) has been shown to segregate with affected members of Paget's disease families of French-Canadian origin.  In this study, a single base pair deletion (1215delC) was identified as segregating with the majority of affected members in the pedigree (Chapter 6).  This deletion introduces a stop codon at amino acid position 392 which potentially results in early termination of the protein and loss of the ubiquitin binding domain. The three affected members of the family that do not share the affected haplotype do not carry a mutation in the coding region of SQSTM/p62.  Screening of affected members from 10 further Paget's disease families identified the previously reported P392L mutation in 2 (20%) families.  No SQSTM1/p62 coding mutations have been found in the remaining 8 families or in 113 aged matched controls. In conclusion, this project has identified genetic loci and mutations that segregate with individuals affected with Paget's disease. Further investigation of the functional significance of the genetic changes at these loci is expected to lead to a better understanding of the molecular basis of this disease.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paget's disease of bone</field><field name="subject">Osteitis deformans</field><field name="subject">genetic loci</field><field name="subject">molecular genetics</field><field name="subject">gene mapping</field><field name="subject">chromosome mapping</field><field name="subject">chromosomes</field><field name="subject">mutation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040319.125358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Structure Within the Distribution of the Indo-West Pacific Mud Crab Scylla serrata (Forskal, 1775)</field><field name="creator">Gopurenko, David</field><field name="description">It is often hypothesised that marine species with mobile planktonic phases are capable of widespread dispersal and may therefore be genetically homogenous throughout their distribution. Studies that have demonstrated positive correlation between duration of plankton phase and levels of gene flow reinforce the prediction that life history characteristics of marine species determine the potential extent of genetic and demographic connectivity throughout their distributions. This prediction has however been challenged by studies that have employed genetic markers highly sensitive to both historical and contemporary demographic changes. Disparities between dispersal potential and measured levels of gene flow have been demonstrated both among historically disconnected ocean basins and within semi-enclosed areas of strong hydraulic connectivity. These studies and others highlight a need for greater focus on factors that may influence population structure and distribution for marine species. In this thesis, I have examined genetic structure within and among populations of an estuarine species of mud crab Scylla serrata (Forskal, 1775) using a number of genetic markers and methods. The species is widely distributed throughout mangrove and estuarine habitats of the Indo - West Pacific (IWP); it is generally assumed that life-history characteristics of S. serrata promote high levels of population admixture and gene flow throughout its distribution. Alternatively, factors that have promoted population genetic structure for a variety of IWP marine species may also have affected S. serrata populations. By investigating genetic structure at several spatial scales of sampling, I was able to address a variety of hypotheses concerning the species distribution, dispersal, and genetic structure. Episodic changes to marine habitat and conditions experienced within the IWP during the Pleistocene may have affected genetic structure for a broad variety of marine taxa. The relative strength of this hypothesis may be assayed by comparative genetic studies of widespread IWP taxa with high dispersal capacity. In order to ascertain levels of historical and contemporary gene flow for S. serrata, I investigated the phylogeographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes sampled throughout the species range. Adults were sampled from three west Indian ocean locations (N=21), six west Pacific sites (N=68), and two sites from northern eastern Australia (N=35). Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 549 base pairs of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) coding gene identified 18 distinct haplotypes. Apart from that seen in northern Australia, haplotype diversity was low (h &lt; 0.36) at each of the locations. Total nucleotide diversity in the entire sample (excluding northern Australian locations) was also low (p = 0.09). Haplotypes clustered into two clades separated by approximately 2% sequence divergence. One clade was widespread throughout the IWP (clade 1) whereas the other was strictly confined to northern Australia (clade 2). Genealogical assessment of sequenced haplotypes relative to their distributions suggested that a historical radiation of clade 1 S. serrata throughout the IWP occurred rapidly and recently (&lt;1Myr bp) from a west Pacific origin. The evidence of fixed unique haplotypes at the majority of locations suggested that contemporary maternal gene flow between trans-oceanic sites was limited. Contrary to reports for other widespread species of IWP taxa, there was no evidence of lengthy periods of regional separation between Indian from Pacific Ocean populations. However, results may indicate a separation of northern Australian crabs from other locations before and during the IWP radiation. I speculated that this isolation might have resulted in the formation of a new species of Scylla. Additional sampling of mud crabs from the Australian coastline allowed an examination of the diversity and distribution of clade 1 and 2 haplotypes among recently formed shelf-connected coastal locations, and across a historical bio-geographic barrier. Over 300 individuals were sampled from multiple locations within coastal regions (western, northern and eastern) of Australia and analysed for mutational differences at the COI gene. Analysis of molecular variance partitioned by sampling scale (Among regions, within regions, and within all locations) indicated mitochondrial haplotypes were structured regionally (P &lt; 0.001), which contrasted with evidence of genetic panmixia within regions. Regional genetic structure broadly correlated with hydrological circulation, supporting the contention that release and transport of propagules away from the estuary may allow genetic connectivity among widespread shelf-connected S. serrata populations. That similar patterns of maternal gene flow were absent among trans-oceanic populations may indicate that the spatial scale of effective dispersal for this species is generally limited to areas of coastal shelf. The two clades of haplotypes were geographically separated either side of the Torres Strait, a narrow sea channel connecting the northern and eastern regions of coastal Australia. This pattern of historical genetic separation was concordant with a number of other marine species across northern Australia, and might indicate a shared history of vicariance induced by eustasy. Alternatively, differences in diversity and distribution of the clades may be evidence of two independent expansions of clade 1 and 2 crab populations into Australian regions following post-glacial estuary formation. Overall, despite evidence of genetic panmixia within extensive sections of the Australian distribution, there was also evidence of significant barriers to maternal gene flow with both shallow and deep regional phylogeographic assortment of mtDNA haplotypes. The presence of these barriers indicated both historical and contemporary factors have imposed limits to effective dispersal by this species among coastal habitats. A subset of the Australian sample (8 locations, N = 188) was also examined for variation at five microsatellite loci developed specifically here for S. serrata. I examined variation among samples at each of the loci to: a) independently verify regional structure among crab populations previously detected using the mtDNA analysis; b) test for evidence of co-distributed non-interbreeding stocks of S. serrata within Australian waters by examining samples for segregation of alleles within microsatellite loci concordant with the two mtDNA clades. The frequency and distribution of alleles for each of the highly polymorphic microsatellites were homogenous at all levels of sample partitioning and contrasted sharply with the instances of both weak and strong regional phylogeographic assortment of mtDNA haplotypes. These contrasting results between different genomic markers were examined in relation to the species life history, and to differences in mutational rate and inheritance of the genetic markers. Several hypotheses may explain the disparity, however it is most likely that rampant homoplasy and high rates of mutation at the microsatellite in conjunction with large Ne at locations may be concerted to delay equilibrium between genetic drift and migration among populations at these highly polymorphic nuclear markers. There was also no evidence that alleles at microsatellite loci were co-segregated with mtDNA clades and therefore no evidence of segregated breeding between the clades of crabs. Whether or not this result was also driven by homoplasy at the microsatellites remains unknown. Recently established mud crab populations (~ 3-4 years old) observed in a number of southwest Australian estuaries are almost 1000 kilometres south of their previously recorded distribution on the Western Australian coast. Colonisation of the southwest region may have occurred either by a natural range expansion from northwest Australian mud crab populations or by means of translocation from any number of mud crab sources within the Indo - West Pacific. I used mtDNA analysis to verify the species and determine the potential source population(s) of the colonists, by comparing sampled genetic material from the southwest (N = 32) against that previously described for the genus. I also compared levels of diversity at mtDNA and two microsatellite loci between the colonist and suspected source population(s) to qualitatively determine if the southwest populations experienced reductions in genetic diversity as a result of the colonisation process. All colonist samples had S. serrata mtDNA COI sequences identical to one previously described as both prevalent and endemic to northwest Australia. High levels of genetic diversity among source and colonist populations at two microsatellite loci contrasted to the mitochondrial locus which displayed an absence of variation among colonists compared to moderately diverse source populations. I argued that the southwest was recently colonised by large numbers of S. serrata propagules derived from the northwest of Australia, possibly due to an enhanced recruitment event coinciding with the reported strengthening of the Leeuwin Current during 1999. Contrasting levels of diversity among nuclear and mitochondrial loci may be attributed to a difference in response by the two genomes to the colonisation process. I predict that such differences may be generally prevalent among plankton-dispersed species. Finally, I discuss aspects of the species distribution and biogeography obtained as a composite of the various results and ideas expressed in this thesis. I propose that S. serrata populations in the IWP may have experienced several cycles of extinction and population retraction from temperate areas followed by subsequent periods of colonisation and rapid coastal expansion in response to the effects of glacial episodes on coastal habitats in the IWP. I propose that persistence of this species as remnant populations of clade 1 and 2 crabs at equatorial locations during low sea level stands provided source populations for later expansions by the species into a variety of coastal areas throughout the IWP. Further analysis is required to determine if mtDNA clade 1 and 2 crabs are non-interbreeding species of mud crab.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mud crab</field><field name="subject">mud crabs</field><field name="subject">mudcrab</field><field name="subject">mudcrabs</field><field name="subject">Scylla serrata</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">distribution</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Northern Australia</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Indo-West Pacific</field><field name="subject">Pacific Ocean</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030926.124631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fields of inequality: the waning of national developmentalism and the political economy of agribusiness in Siam: case studies of development and restructuring in Thailand's agri-food sector</field><field name="creator">Goss, Jasper Adam</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the political and social dynamics of agribusiness in Thailand.

Literature that is critical of fast food labour management policy and practice often portrays employers as offering work that is low paid, unchallenging and uninteresting. However, others argue that the industry provides young workers with: a first resume entry, training opportunities, the chance to develop a career and a path into employment. This study interprets these two perspectives as reflecting either misalignment or alignment of employee/crew and employer preferences. Such an interpretation recognises that fast food work does not represent a career for many who do it but is short term or 'stop-gap' in nature. The study's research question is: to what extent does management preference for elements of work align with the preferred working arrangements of crew at McDonald's Australia? This research subjects McDonald's Australian stores to independent scrutiny.  Previous research in this area has mostly used qualitative methods. Earlier studies, by and large, provide descriptive accounts of fast food employment however they often lack the rigour of an empirical investigation. The present research uses a structured survey method to obtain data from crew and managers. Results are analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings focus on three areas of labour management: industrial relations, work organisation and human resource management. Several themes relating to alignment of preferences in the fast food employment relationship are identified. These are: crew have scant knowledge of industrial relations, do not like aspects of work organisation, but respond positively to certain human resource management policies and practices; crew lack knowledge of labour management issues generally; crew work is simple and repetitive; and, many young crew seem to dislike aspects of fast food work as they get older but others, who have distinctive characteristics, appear to continue to like the McDonald's approach as they age.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fast food industry</field><field name="subject">McDonald's model</field><field name="subject">labour management policy</field><field name="subject">industrial relations</field><field name="subject">work organisation</field><field name="subject">human resource management</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061106.114525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlation and Response in Spherical Many-Electron Systems</field><field name="creator">Gould, Timothy John</field><field name="description">Ab initio prediction of the electronic properties of solids is traditionally performed using groundstate Density Functional Theory. These methods are unreliable however, for a class of important problems involving weak attractive forces. These problems include (i) the energetics of hydrogen storage and metal interactions in graphene, (ii) cohesion properties of some polymer systems and (iii) possibly, the weak hydrophobic forces in biomolecules. For these cases a more powerful method than groundstate DFT are timedependent DFT (tdDFT) methods related to the Random-Phase Approximation (RPA). All of these methods proceed by looking at the dynamic density-density response function, whose long-ranged properties naturally lead to the weak forces referred to above. In this thesis we have tested these ideas by investigating electronic response and correlation on the predicted properties of spherical atoms. We have developed and tested a variety of approximations to the timedependent response function through approximations of the tdDFT class and a new method involving greater self-consistency in the screening equation, the inhomogenous STLS approach. Through the development of new methods and computer code, we have solved the response equation allowing us to test our approximations on atoms. Calculation of certain dynamic and static properties of a variety of atoms within our approximations generally agree well with known results. In this thesis we have calculated excitation energies of Helium, dipole polarisabilities and C6 van der Waals (vdW) coefficients of a variety of atoms, and groundstate correlation energies Ec of some atoms. The excitation spectra of Helium generated in our new PGG+c approximation are in good agreement with experiment. The dipole polarisabilities are generally in good agreement with known results, with the exception of Magnesium, Beryllium and Sodium. The C6 coefficients are a little poorer with the exception of Helium where they are nearly exact. Correlation energies are generally reasonable in the PGG+c approximation although they are considerably less accurate than the other properties we have calculated for all atoms other than He. The ISTLS correlation energy of Helium is within 5% suggesting that this method may perform well for larger atoms where our present numerical techniques require improvement. These generally positive results suggest that the approximations we have developed may be applied to more complicated systems such as those described above with good results.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spherical many-electron systems</field><field name="subject">electrons</field><field name="subject">spherical atoms</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030818.125106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher preparation for the world of work: a study of pre-service primary teacher education in Fiji</field><field name="creator">Govinda, Ishwar Lingam</field><field name="description">This study was undertaken to selectively investigate pre-service primary teacher education in one of the Pacific island countries, and in particular to explore whether it provides an adequate and enriching professional preparation to beginning teachers with a view to satisfying the demands of work in the field. In doing so, the issue was examined in detail in a teacher education institution located in Fiji, namely, Lautoka Teachers College (LTC). An integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches was employed to explore if beginning teachers from the College are provided with appropriate professional preparation as future teachers. Using LTC as a case study, basic data gathering methods utilized questionnaire surveys, interviews and documentary analyses. Survey-based data were gathered from the beginning teachers to find out their perceptions of the pre-service program that they had completed. Data were also gathered from their Head Teachers to ascertain views on the beginning teachers' professional preparation for the demands of work in their schools. In addition, an interview-based approach explored the perceptions of not only the College staff but also the Ministry of Education officials with regard to the preparation of teachers in meeting the demands of work and responsibilities in the field. Documentary-based research was also used to explore matters associated with teacher preparation at LTC and to integrate the findings with the data obtained in the surveys and interviews. The study indicated that the beginning teachers were not adequately prepared for the demands of work and responsibilities expected of them as perceived by the profession and other stakeholders. A number of factors were found to be contributing to the perceived inadequacy of the professional preparation of beginning teachers. Lack of physical facilities and quality of educational resources together with an outdated curriculum contributed to this situation. At the same time, lack of support from the principal stakeholder in terms of staff professional development and funding was also cited as impacting upon the quality of pre-service teacher education provided to the beginning teachers. An important emergent issue emanating from the study relates to colonial influence on Fiji's education in general, and teacher education at LTC in particular. Some of the problems LTC grappled with were attributable to certain features of the formalised educational system introduced during the colonial era. These aspects, such as the inheritance of the system of educational administration and centralised control, constrained the College in attempting to fulfil its professional role in an appropriate and responsive manner. The administrative system and related context, delivery and assessment elements established in education during the colonial period have been retained and not attuned to contemporary Fiji needs despite the changing times. In overview terms, the presence of these aspects appeared to have impacted negatively on College's effective conduct of its professional role and responsibilities. Further, this study provides specific insights into the pre-service primary teacher education in Fiji, in particular the importance of having relevant policies and programs to ensure the provision of an adequate and enriching professional preparation for teachers to meet the range of work commitments in the field. The study concluded that a number of factors influence the professional preparation of future teachers and these need to be considered with a view to ensuring that teachers are able to meet the demands of their profession. Based on these findings, the study recommends ways and means to improve the pre-service primary teacher education at LTC, which in turn could be expected to enhance the professional preparation of teachers and their competence within the context of teaching in Fiji primary schools. Additionally, some possible areas for future research have been suggested.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">Fijian</field><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">teacher preparation</field><field name="subject">primary education</field><field name="subject">pre-service teacher education</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="subject">Lautoka Teachers College</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041021.131036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accessing the Professional Artistry of Teaching</field><field name="creator">Grainger, Sheila</field><field name="description">This study accesses the professional artistry of teaching which I argue is being eroded by the representation of teaching in a discourse of technical rationality (Fish, 1991, 1995).  Accessing professional artistry is the first step towards identifying how it figures in teaching practice and how it can be (mis)represented in theory, policy and teachers' own talk about their practice.  The research method involved: analysing the official New Zealand documents pertaining to teacher performance management to demonstrate how the dominant or hegemonic discourse of technical rationality marginalises the contesting discourse of professional artistry (Schon, 1983, 1987, 1995) and impacts negatively on the profession; collecting interview data through a process of video stimulated recall with student teachers to allow them to reflect on their own professional artistry; exposing the complexity of the student teachers' decision making in action through analysing the video stimulated recall data using the membership categorisation tools (Sacks, 1996; Baker, 1982, 1997, 2000) available in discourse analysis; using Fairclough's (2001) framework for Critical Discourse Analysis to explore the discursive and semiotic aspects of an identified social problem, namely teachers' disillusionment with the teaching profession and their alienation from their professional artistry, 'to produce knowledge which can lead to emancipatory change' (Fairclough, 2001, p.30). I argue that the identified problem is so deeply embedded in the discursive and semiotic aspects of the networked practices in which teaching is carried out, that a common sense interpretation of teaching is inadequate to expose the complexity of teachers' work and therefore inadequate to allow the professional artistry of teaching to be accessed and appreciated.  A growing rhetoric/reality gap between teaching theory/educational policy and teaching practice serves to entrench the problem in the New Zealand Education System, positioning teachers in a disempowering discourse of technical rationality in which they are 'not to be trusted with more than the technical aspects of the job' (Fish, 1991, p.31).  I argue that the contesting discourse of professional artistry valorises teachers' agency in interpreting and framing the problems of practice, crafting individual solutions to them and wanting to do a good job from a personal and professional commitment to their work and that this is the discourse in which teaching is represented at the local level by teachers themselves.  This discursive positioning of teachers, contrasted with their positioning in the official discourse of educational policy offers an enlarged view of all aspects of professional practice as having the potential to inform theory as well as be informed by it, and therefore to generate new knowledge about teaching possibly leading to emancipatory change.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">teaching as an art</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">performance management</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Critical Discourse Analysis</field><field name="subject">educational policy</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">professional artistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031114.084528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Wot's in a String O'Words?': An Ethnomethodological Study Investigating the Approach to, and Construction of, the Classroom Religion Program in the Catholic Preschool</field><field name="creator">Grajczonek, Janice P</field><field name="description">This study investigates current teaching practice of the classroom religion program in two preschool settings in the Archdiocese of Brisbane. It also examines the approach to, and construction of, religious education in key Church and Brisbane Archdiocesan documents. Since the first Catholic school opened in Australia in 1820, research and scholarship have elucidated deeper understandings of the nature and purpose of religious education. Over time, a variety of approaches and curriculum models for the classroom religion program have been implemented in both primary and secondary schools. Broadly speaking there are two approaches to the Catholic primary school classroom religion program: educational and catechetical. The educational approach does not presume students' faith, and aims to develop students' religious literacy. The catechetical presumes student faith and aims to develop it. Currently, the Brisbane Catholic Education Religious Education Guidelines (Barry &amp; Brennan, 1997a, 1997b; Barry et al., 2003) adopts an educational approach to the classroom religion program. However, while the approach to religious education in Catholic primary and secondary schools has received scholarly and professional attention over the years, the nature and purpose of religious education in early childhood education in the context of the Catholic preschool, have received minimal attention. Although the first preschools in Catholic schools in the Brisbane Archdiocese opened in 1988, there is no set curriculum for the classroom religion program for the preschool sector. However, Brisbane Catholic Education is presently preparing such a document in preparation for the introduction of the preparatory year of schooling into all Archdiocesan Catholic schools in 2007. The specific focus of the study is to use teachers' talk-in-interaction with their students during classroom religion lessons, as a means to exemplify their approaches to, and constructions of, their classroom religion programs. Underpinned by an Ethnomethodological methodology, the study gathered data in the form of lesson recordings from two preschool teachers. The lesson transcripts are analysed using the ethnomethodological analytic tools of Conversation Analysis and Membership Categorisation Analysis. These analyses reveal deep insights into teachers' practices: the nature of the content they present, their approaches to, and constructions of, their religion programs, as well as the ways in which they construct their students. In addition to classroom practice, this study also investigates relevant sections of the key Church documents The Religious Dimension of Education in a Catholic School  (Congregation for Catholic Education, 1988) and the General Directory of Catechesis  (Congregation for the Clergy, 1997), as well as the  Archdiocese of Brisbane Catholic Education document,  'Religious Education in Preschools', which is part of the Preschool Handbook: Towards Continuity of Learning in the Early Years  (Catholic Education Archdiocese of Brisbane, 2002b). Together with the Ethnomethodological methodology, this part of the investigation adopts a functional linguistic methodology using the analytic technique, Systemic Functional Linguistics. Both Systemic Functional Linguistics and Membership Categorisation Analysis are used to explicate these documents. The two Church documents are critical documents, as they contribute to curriculum development and implementation of the classroom religion program in all Australian Catholic schools, whilst the Brisbane document outlines the current policy for religious education in Catholic preschools in the Archdiocese. These analyses elucidate key insights into how the classroom religion program is approached, and reveal that whilst the Church documents maintain an educational approach, aspects of the documents are ambiguous. Analysis of the Brisbane Archdiocesan preschool document reveal it to be at variance with the current educational approach taken by the Archdiocese in its classroom religion curriculum for primary and secondary schools. This study contributes significantly to the nature and purpose of religious education in the early years. It has implications for the theory and practice of the classroom religion program in early childhood, and for preservice and inservice teacher education programs.  It also contributes to policy design that guides and shapes curriculum development and implementation. The use of analytic techniques drawn from two different methodologies, Ethnomethodology and functional linguistics, enables a detailed and in-depth analysis, showing them to be effective techniques to be used together in research. These methodologies complement each other to reveal critical insights into both the document studies and teacher classroom interaction. The nature and purpose of religious education in early childhood education is  evolving. As Catholic dioceses continue to expand into early childhood education, the focus on religious education in this sector becomes more critical. This study provides a significant foundation for future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Preschool religious program</field><field name="subject">religious education</field><field name="subject">Catholic education</field><field name="subject">Brisbane Catholic Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070705.120432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Journey to Sustainability: Small Regions, Sustainable Carrying Capacity and Sustainability Assessment Methods</field><field name="creator">Graymore, Michelle</field><field name="description">Small region sustainability is an extremely important part of the journey to sustainability of the global population, as the most difference can be made at this spatial level through decision making and community choice.  However, small regions have not been the focus of sustainability literature.  Therefore, this thesis develops theory to explain what small region sustainability involves and tested the applicability of current sustainability assessment methods to find an effective tool for the journey to sustainability that can be used for social learning, decision making, policy development, research and monitoring of sustainability in small regions.  It was found through the development of a model of sustainable carrying capacity and the major pressures of human activities on the environment, that sustainability for small regions means living equitably with the impacts of human activities in the region within the limits of its ecosystems. This thesis also found that none of the current sustainability methods tested were effective or useful as a tool for small regions.  Therefore, a new sustainability assessment method was developed, the Sustainable Carrying Capacity Assessment (SCCA), which assesses the equitability and size of the major pressures that the human activities are causing and determines if this pressure exceeds the sustainable carrying capacity of the region, and thus, the sustainability of the population.  Thus, for small regions to become sustainable, they must live equitably within the sustainable carrying capacity of the region's ecosystems, and a tool that can help them achieve this is the SCCA. By raising social awareness, guiding policy development and decision making this method can help guide small regions, and other spatial levels on their journey to sustainability.  Therefore, it is recommended that Local Government Areas, Regional Organisation of Councils, schools, local community groups and anyone who wants to learn more about sustainability use this method.  This thesis, therefore, makes a significant contribution to the field of sustainability.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small region sustainability</field><field name="subject">global sustainability</field><field name="subject">global population</field><field name="subject">Sustainable Carrying Capacity Assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060303.132137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memento Mori: A Personal Story of Impermanance</field><field name="creator">Greenshields, Barbara</field><field name="description">My project reflects upon our body's impermanence and our efforts to balance the enormity of the concept of mortality with living every day. It investigates the condition of being that one cannot permit oneself to know too often, that is, the condition of, inhabiting a body through which one engages meaningfully with the world as a conscious being, but aware that this body will die. Within this framework, I investigate concepts of consciousness, sentience, and impermanence. These are concepts that are not clearly delineated in experience. There is a need to grasp them by means of other concepts that are understood in clearer terms. Using the quotidian experiences of food preparation, eating and the domestic as metaphorical tools, I delve into these themes. As I worked with these ideas the wider possibilities, both material and conceptual became evident. I expanded the initial medium of food to encompass personal objects and daily bodily processes in my attempt to probe complicated feelings about the impermanence of my own body. The project matured into a closer examination of what could be read as signs in every day life, of my body's vulnerability to death. The specific areas of focus are: Skin, Reanimation of the inanimate, Mouth, Concepts of the internal, Organs, Offal, Transmogrification, Organic destiny. Beginning with the skin that we are encased in, I used my body as an armature to produce a facsimile of my own hollowed-out empty skin. In Reanimation of the inanimate, I explore the continuum from preserved food to fermented food investigating the development from food as organic material whose life had passed to food as organic material in which change is an indicator of ongoing life. In the section titled Mouth, I consider the concept of exploring the world with one's mouth and the notion of anti-food. Introduced in Concepts of the internal are three investigations of the internal human body: anatomical illustrations from the sixteenth century, a cinematic portrayal from 1966 that has included in its subtext a spiritual journey, and a current project in which the internal human body is seen as purely scientific data. In Organs I investigate the idea of ingesting 'properties of character' that can be culturally associated with internal organs and the possibility that such characteristics could permeate the person ingesting them. In the section titled Offal, I propose that the polarity of life and death inherent in food is most evident when eating a meal of offal. In Transmogrificaation, I consider the conundrum of my internal organs, that is, they are mine in fact they are 'me' and at the same time they are foreign to me. In this section, I also investigate the concept of my body as a conduit with the ability to transport and transform matter. Finally, in Organic destiny I posit the notion that as bodies we are an ongoing process, an accumulation of matter built up over time and that we are small participants in a much bigger phenomenon.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mortality</field><field name="subject">consciousness</field><field name="subject">sentience</field><field name="subject">impermanence</field><field name="subject">transmogrification</field><field name="subject">organic destiny</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060727.123955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thioredoxin and Oxidative Stress</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Mary Sarah-Jane</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis involve the expression and characterisation of recombinant truncated thioredoxin (tTrx) and the potential involvement that thioredoxin (Trx) has in the cellular responses to oxidative stress.  Truncated Trx (80 amino acids) was expressed from a plasmid containing the ORF for tTrx that had been introduced into E.coli BL-21(DE3) cells.  The protein was initially extracted using a combination of high concentrations of urea, high pH levels, and multiple sonification steps to remove the tTrx from inclusion bodies formed during expression.  This procedure produced a stable solution of tTrx.  Purification of tTrx from this protein solution required anion exchange chromatography followed by gel permeation in a HPLC system to obtain fully purified, recombinant tTrx which allowed further characterisation studies to be undertaken. An initial investigation into tTrx was performed to determine some basic physical, biochemical and functional aspects of this hitherto relatively undefined protein. Analysis by sedimentation equilibrium indicated that freshly prepared tTrx forms a single species with a molecular weight of 18.8kDa.  This value indicates that recombinant tTrx naturally forms a dimer in solution that was shown to be non-covalent in nature and stable in solution. The capacity of tTrx to reduce protein disulphide bonds was determined using the insulin reduction assay.  Results show that tTrx lacks this particular redox ability. The rate of oxidisation at 4 degrees C was analysed using free thiol determination, sedimentation equilibrium and SDS-PAGE patterning.  Results indicated a steady rise in the degree of oxidation of tTrx over an eight day period.  After six days the oxidated protein consistently displayed the presence of intramolecular disulphide bonds.  Covalently-linked disulphide dimers and higher molecular weight oligomers were detectable after eight days oxidation. An investigation of the reducing capacity of the basic Trx system determined that fully oxidised tTrx was unable to act alone as a substrate for thioredoxin reductase (TR).  However, when reduced Trx was added to the system, it appeared capable of acting as an electron donor to the oxidised tTrx in order to reduce disulphide groups. Recombinant tTrx was successfully radiolabelled with Trans 35S-methionine/cysteine for use in cell association studies.  No evidence was found to indicate the presence of a receptor for tTrx on either MCF-7 or U-937 cells.  Findings suggest that a low level of non-specific binding of tTrx to these cell lines rather than a classical ligand-binding mechanism occurs thus suggesting the absence of a cell surface receptor for tTrx. The role that Trx may play in the cellular responses to oxidative stress was also investigated. The chemical oxidants hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and diamide were used to establish an in vitro model of oxidative stress for the choriocarcinoma cytotrophoblast cell line JEG-3.  Cellular function was assessed in terms of membrane integrity, metabolic activity and the ability to synthesis new DNA following exposure to these oxidants.  Results indicated that both agents were capable of causing cells to undergo oxidative stress without inducing immediate apoptosis or necrosis.  Initially, JEG-3 cells exposed to 38&#956;M or 75&#956;M H2O2 or 100&#956;M diamide were shown to display altered cell metabolism and DNA synthesis without loss to cell viability or membrane integrity.  Cells were also shown to be capable of some short-term recovery but later lapsed into a more stressed state. Expression levels of Trx were studied to determine whether this type of chemical stress caused a change in intercellular protein levels.  Both cELISA and western blotting results indicated that only cells exposed to 100&#956;M diamide displayed any significant increase in Trx protein levels after 6 or 8hrs exposure to the oxidant. Further studies over a longer time-frame were also performed.  These found that when JEG-3 cells were exposed to 18&#956;M H2O2 or 200&#956;M diamide over 12-48hrs, a positive correlation between increasing endogenous Trx protein levels and a decline in cell proliferation was observed. Cytotrophoblast cells, which are responsible for implantation and placentation, are susceptible to oxidative stress in vivo and their anti-oxidant capacity is fundamental to the establishment of pregnancy. The findings obtained during these studies suggest that Trx plays a role in this process.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">recombinant truncated thioredoxin</field><field name="subject">tTrx</field><field name="subject">oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">oxidisation</field><field name="subject">oxidization</field><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="subject">chemistry</field><field name="subject">biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040301.082639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some New Aspects of Radical Trapping Using an Aminoxyl Radical Trap</field><field name="creator">Grice, I.

Based upon the experimental results, the mechanism of initiation is suggested as proceeding via the 'free monomer' mechanism. Additionally, the effect of Lewis acids on the initiation mechanism is reported. A study of the addition of phosphorus-centred radicals to alkenes and phenylacetylene, utilising the aminoxyl radical trapping technique is reported. The results indicate a decreased rate of addition by both diphenylphosphinyl and dimethoxyphosphinyl radicals to cyclic versus acyclic alkenes. In contrast to cyclic alkenes, both these phosphorus-centred radicals add readily to the triple bond of phenylacetylene. The stereochemistry of the addition of diphenyiphosphinyl and dimethoxyphosphinyl radicals and of the aminoxyl trap is discussed. The stereochemistry of the addition of benzoyloxyl radicals to a conformationally rigid alkene, trans-a2-octalin is reported.

Importantly, research within the (social) marketing domain recognises that the concept of exchange is a fundamental aspect of influencing people to take on positive social issue behaviours (Andreasen, 1995; Rothschild, 1999). However, regardless of the influence of social marketing, ultimately the behavioural exchange resides with the individual. This infers that exchange can be considered from the individual&#146;s (i.e., consumer&#146;s) point of view, of intrapersonal or self-exchange (Gould, 1994). Furthermore, the conditions that facilitate or constrain this form of exchange are found within the individual &#150; and relate to for example, individual differences.  However, in recent years there has been limited interest in exchange theory within the marketing domain and, in particular, exchange as a fundamental consumer behaviour phenomenon (Anderson et al, 1999; Gould, 1994). This study seeks to extend current consumer behaviour and social marketing knowledge in the areas of exchange theory and personality. Based on an examination of the extant literature, a model of determinants and outcomes of Social Issue Exchange was developed and empirically tested. The Social Issue Exchange Model proposed in this study accounts for a number of associations which includes a representation of personality termed pro-social orientation along with social issue involvement, attitude toward social issues, subjective assessment of negative consequences and feelings.  The determinants of social issue exchange included the multi-component variable pro-social orientation comprising the traits risk aversion, locus of control, consideration of future consequences, susceptibility to normative influence and social responsibility along with the variables social issue involvement and attitude towards social issues. The outcomes of social issue exchange include the variables of subjective assessment of negative consequences and feelings. The study adopted a quantitative methodology using an Internet administered questionnaire that allowed for the measurement of the determinants and outcomes of social issue exchange. The construction of the questionnaire followed a sequential process which involved developing new measures, utilising and adapting existing measures and then pre-testing these measures to ensure the development of a psychometrically sound and respondent-friendly survey instrument. The final survey used Excess Alcohol Consumption and Speeding social issues as stimuli for the study. Data collection resulted in 1146 (comprising 559 for Speeding social issue, and 587 for Excess Alcohol Consumption social issue) useable surveys for subsequent analysis.  Analysis included a number of statistical procedures including correlation analysis, exploratory factor analysis, reliability analysis and tests of the model via Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis. Overall, the findings provided support for the proposed Social Issue Exchange Model. In terms of the measurement model, the findings show that pro-social orientation accounted for different amounts of variance in the five traits, with consideration for further consequences accounting for the most variance and susceptibility to normative influence accounting for the least. In terms of the inner model, all the hypothesised paths were supported with the exception of attitude towards social issues and social issue exchange. A comparison of the smaller models (i.e., Speeding and Excess Alcohol Consumption) with the overall model indicated that largely the relationships were consistent, with the exception of social issue involvement and attitude towards social issues which was not supported in the Excess Alcohol Consumption model.  The findings provide a number of theoretical and practical implications for research.  From a theoretical perspective, broadening the concept of exchange to account for self-exchange in the context of social issue behaviours contributes to the body of knowledge on exchange. Moreover, aggregating traits to form the multi-component construct pro-social orientation takes a holistic approach to personality and thereby, provides greater clarification of the psychological processes that drive individuals to respond positively or negatively to social issues and associated behaviours.  From a practical perspective, this study may lead to a better understanding of how personal characteristics can shape an individual&#146;s response to social issues as well as their behaviours. In summary, the importance of understanding the processes that influence individuals&#146; social issue behaviours provides a justification for this study.

This present study reviewed current models of trauma and hypothesised three mechanisms of change leading to future health benefits: exposure, devaluation, and benefit-finding. Instructions for the standard writing paradigm were manipulated to isolate and increase engagement with each of these processes. It was hypothesised that if any one of these processes were to underlie health benefits, participants assigned to that condition would obtain more benefit than standard writing participants. Individual differences were also hypothesised to interact with each process to amplify or detract from their influence in leading to future benefit.  A total of 201 university students were recruited from Griffith University. Participants were assigned to one of five writing conditions: Control, Standard, Exposure, Devaluation, and Benefit-Finding.  Sessions were conducted once a week for three weeks. Physiological and self-report measures were taken before, during and after writing sessions. Follow-up assessments of psychological and physical health were taken at 2 and 6-months post-writing. Essay content analysis suggested that participants wrote in the instructed manner. Participants assigned to each of the groups experienced expected amounts of distress and affect changes. Overall, results failed to replicate the beneficial health effects for the standard emotional writing paradigm. There were no significant physical or psychological benefits for the standard trauma-writing participants in comparison to control. However, a trend in the appropriate direction was noted for illness visits at 6-months. Furthermore, in support of Greenberg and Stone's (1992) findings, standard writing participants who disclosed more severe and personal experiences evidenced significant illness visit reductions in comparison to control.  Comparisons between standard and experimental trauma writing groups failed to support hypotheses that any one mechanism was responsible for physical health benefits. Examination of psychological self-report measures indicated exposure participants experienced the greatest reduction on the Impact of Events Scale at two months. However, these participants experienced greater reduction of positive affect and growth for the experience. They also became more anxious, depressed, and stressed at six-months follow-up. Process variables were examined within the exposure condition to explain these findings. Habituation was found to be strongly associated with the alternate outcomes. Individual differences. Including alexithymia, absorption, and negative affect, were also related to outcome. Benefit-finding participants experienced the greatest increase on a measure of post-traumatic growth at two-months and positive affect for the experience, but the finding was significant only in comparison to exposure and devaluation groups.   The results of this study failed to identify the process of change, but suggest specific areas for future research. The findings demonstrate the importance of comprehensive health research to avoid blanket statements that suggest a paradigm either does or does not lead to health benefits. The results also support the manipulation of the writing paradigm to examine the role of emotion processing in trauma and health research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">writing therapy</field><field name="subject">graphotherapy</field><field name="subject">emotional writing</field><field name="subject">trauma</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">cognitive-behavioural therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040526.130108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Balancing Work and Family: Perspectives of Australian Dual-Earner Parents</field><field name="creator">Gudmundsson, Amanda Jayne</field><field name="description">In contemporary Australian workplaces there now exists many employed parents who are endeavouring to balance participation between the two central life domains of work and family.  For parents living in dual-earner families, simultaneously occupying work and family roles can be difficult and has been associated with outcomes such as physical and psychological health problems and organisational behaviour deficits.  In contrast, parents satisfied with their combination of work and family roles have shown positive organisational attitudes and increased psychological health.  The purpose of this research was to investigate the work and family role accumulation experiences of parents living in dual-earner couple relationships, and to explore the strategies and processes used by these parents to combine their work and family roles.  This research was conducted using a two-phase cross-sectional methodology, incorporating qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods.  In the first instance, 32 mothers and fathers from intact dual-earner couples employed in lower-level or blue-collar jobs were interviewed at length regarding their work and family role accumulation experiences.  The perceptions offered by these parents illustrated the difficulties and tensions they encountered in combining their roles as well as the rewards and benefits they associated with their lifestyle choice.  In finding that dual-earner parents perceived both conflict and enhancement to be associated with work and family role accumulation, these results appeared to be paradoxically explained by the two competing theories of role occupancy, the role scarcity (Goode, 1960) and role expansion hypotheses (Sieber, 1974).  However, further scrutiny of the data revealed that the role scarcity and role expansion hypotheses alone were not sufficient for explaining the choices that parents made about how they distributed their time and commitment between their dual-domain responsibilities.  The parents' interviews contained numerous descriptions of behaviours and thoughts that represented female care provision and male income provision.  Accordingly, it was interpreted that the linkages that these dual-earner parents made between their work and family roles were entrenched within traditional gender role identities and values.  This signified that these parents either valued and identified with traditional gender parental roles, or were at least willing to recognise and conform to customary gender parental role behaviour, adjusting their participation and commitment to each primary life domain accordingly.  The implication of this finding was that role identity value and commitment was an underlying concept linking the conflict and enhancement outcomes.  Drawing upon this grounded theoretical direction, a quantitative questionnaire was distributed to parents employed in a range of occupations.  The responses from 286 dual-earner parents to measures of work and parental role identity, and their perception of work and family role occupancy demands (time and stressors), were cluster analysed.  The analysis recovered a stable three-cluster typology, suggesting that dual-earner parents are not a homogeneous category of people and that different groups of parents construct their occupancy of work and family roles in substantially different ways.  The parents clustered into the first group (compromisers) appeared to have reached a somewhat compromised balance between their dominant parental role identity and the demands associated with their occupation of work and family roles, reporting a moderate amount of work/family conflict and enhancement.  In contrast, the parents in the second cluster group (jugglers) were described as finding it difficult to adequately balance high work and family demands and a dominant work role identity, reporting high conflict and low enhancement outcomes.  The parents in the third cluster group (accommodators) were described as having achieved an accommodated balance between the meaning they derived from their work and family roles and the demands of their work and family roles, reporting significantly stronger levels of work/family enhancement and lower levels of work/family conflict in comparison with the parents in the other two groups.   Further analysis of the similarities and differences between the parents in the three cluster groups revealed that significant differences occurred by group on the dependent variable systems of family environment, work and family affect, workplace and personal resources, and work and family social support.  The parents clustered into the compromisers and accommodators groups, who appeared to have reached congruency between their salient role identity and role occupancy demands, demonstrated significantly stronger levels of family cohesion, higher levels of family and childcare satisfaction, and lower rates of emotional exhaustion in comparison with the parents in the jugglers group.  These parents also reported access to a larger social support network, the perception of greater levels of social support, and were more satisfied with their social support network in comparison with the parents in the jugglers group.  It is suggested that these findings offer support for the proposition by Kofodimos (1993) that employed parents can achieve a balanced work/family lifestyle by devoting an appropriate amount of time and energy into their work and family roles to compliment their individual needs and values.  In summary, the results of this research suggest that it is fundamental for future conceptual models of 'work and family' to incorporate the measurement of an individual's personal role identity and value as well as the distributional dimension of role accumulation demands.  This thesis has thus contributed to the theoretical development of work and family role accumulation research, provided an insight into coping strategies and support processes used by dual-earner parents to balance their dual-domain responsibilities, and extended the demographic and occupational scope of the work and family literature.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">families</field><field name="subject">parent</field><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">child</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">two-income families</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040512.164321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Movement and Assimilation of Carbon by Estuarine Invertebrates</field><field name="creator">Guest, Michaela A</field><field name="description">In estuarine and other aquatic systems, it is possible for water to transport locally produced carbon (food) across habitat boundaries, and provide nutrition for animals remote from the carbon source. In estuarine and marine systems, early work examining the movement of carbon from saltmarsh habitats in the USA suggested that carbon may move large distances from inshore to offshore environments. Upon closer examination, however, evidence did not support this paradigm of large-scale carbon movement, referred to as the outwelling hypothesis, in some estuaries. Physical characteristics of estuaries in which large-scale carbon movement did not occur, such as restricted access to the sea, were proposed as a possible explanation, and for these estuaries, movement of carbon among estuarine habitats was considered more likely. A mosaic of saltmarsh and mangrove habitats dominate the subtropical barrier estuary of southern Moreton Bay, Queensland, but there have been no studies that examine the movement of carbon among habitats within this system. Previous studies that examine the movement of carbon have mostly been done in saltmarshes in the northern hemisphere or in tropical mangrove systems. Different vegetation and tidal regimes in temperate marshes of the northern hemisphere preclude generalisations of carbon movement to tropical and subtropical systems. Our understanding of carbon movement in tropical systems may extend to subtropical waters, but the saltmarsh-mangrove mosaic in the subtropics distinguishes them from their tropical counterparts. The mosaic of saltmarsh and mangrove habitats among the barrier islands of southern Moreton Bay thus provide a unique opportunity to examine the small-scale movement of carbon among adjacent habitats in a subtropical system. Stable isotopes of carbon have been used successfully to trace the transfer of carbon from autotrophs to consumers at a range of spatial scales. This method is able to distinguish among carbon sources where autotrophs have different ratios of 13C/12C, and consumers take on the ratio of their food source. The success of stable isotopes in clarifying food web processes, however, depends on isotope ratios changing in predictable ways as elements are processed. As isotope ratios may be influenced by changes in productivity, and differences in nutrient source, they may vary across small and large spatial scales that may confound interpretation of food web processes.  In this study I measured small and large-scale spatial variability of three estuarine autotrophs (the saltmarsh grass, Sporobolus virginicus, the seagrass Zostera capricorni and the algal community epiphytic on Z. capricorni) and showed the small-scale spatial variability to be negligible and insufficient to preclude the use of carbon and nitrogen isotopes in food web studies. Large-scale variability was more pronounced and may be useful for spatial correlation of food webs for more mobile species. The small-scale homogeneity and clearly distinguished isotope ratios of the dominant autotrophs in adjacent saltmarsh and mangrove habitats in southeast Queensland are therefore ideally suited to the study of small-scale carbon movement between adjacent habitats. Carbon isotopes of estuarine invertebrates were used to estimate the movement of particulate carbon between adjacent saltmarsh and mangroves at the tens-of-metre scale.  Carbon isotope values of two crab species (Parasesarma erythrodactyla and Australoplax tridentata) and two snail species (Salinator solida and Ophicardelus quoyi) in saltmarsh closely match those of the saltmarsh grass, and suggest that the movement and assimilation of carbon occurs at a scale much smaller than has previously been examined. In mangroves, the results of this study indicate that microphytobenthos with some contribution of mangrove carbon is the most likely food source for P. erythrodactyla and A. tridentata, although contribution of carbon from saltmarsh is also possible. Under this latter scenario, carbon movement in mangroves would be considered to occur at a scale larger than that in saltmarsh habitat. A study that examined the movement and assimilation of carbon by crabs and an estuarine slug (Onchidina australis) at a finer resolution (i.e. metres) supported the original findings and indicated that the movement and assimilation of carbon occurs 5 - 8 m either side of the saltmarsh-mangrove interface. At this small-scale, the movement and subsequent foraging of crabs among habitats, the movement of particulate carbon among habitats, or a combination of crab and particulate carbon movement are three alternative models that provide plausible explanations for the pattern in carbon isotope values of crabs. Crab movement among these habitats was measured using an array of pitfall traps perpendicular to the saltmarsh-mangrove interface.  To test for carbon movement, samples of detritus were collected at 2 m intervals across this same interface and the carbon isotopes analysed.  For the majority of crabs (up to 90% for both species), movement up or down the shore was less than 1 m from the place of initial capture. Thus, crab movement cannot explain the trend in carbon isotope values of crabs. The pattern in detrital isotope values was similar to that of crabs and indicates that the movement of particulate carbon across the saltmarsh-mangrove interface is the most likely explanation for crab isotope ratios. Sources of carbon for estuarine invertebrates can also depend on the size of the saltmarsh patches.  Examination of the movement and assimilation of carbon by crabs in saltmarsh patches of different sizes adjacent to mangroves indicates that saltmarshes less than 0.3 ha in area are subsidised by the import of allochthonous carbon, most likely from mangroves. These findings contribute substantially to our understanding of the food web value of estuarine habitats and provide an important link between landscape and food web ecology. They also have important implications for determining the conservation value of estuarine habitats with respect to their functional (food web) value. The scale-dependent sampling used in this thesis also provides important evidence for the fine-scale movement of estuarine carbon that has not previously been examined.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Estuarine invertebrates</field><field name="subject">carbon transfer</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay (Queensland)</field><field name="subject">isotopes of carbon</field><field name="subject">saltmarsh habitats</field><field name="subject">mangrove habitats</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061024.110617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elites and Prospects of Democracy in East Timor</field><field name="creator">Guterres, Francisco da Costa</field><field name="description">East Timor is a former colony of Portugal and one-time province of Indonesia. Portuguese colonization ended in 1975 amid brief civil warring between local political parties that had recently been established. This conflict was followed by an Indonesian military invasion, ushering in a period of domination that only ended in 1999 when the United Nations carried out a referendum by which to determine East Timor's future. But this occupation also ended with much violence, generating bitter sentiments between elites that has hampered democratisation even as independence has been won. One of the conclusions made in this study is that East Timor's transition to democracy fails to correlate fully with any of the modal processes outlined in the literature. Rather, in the case of East Timor, a number of pathways merge. In some ways, it begins with what Huntington conceptualized as bottom-up 'replacement', with local mass publics voting against their oppressors. But one of the factors that quickly distinguished this case is that the voting by which change was organized by an external force, the United Nations (UN), and targeted a foreign power, the Indonesian government. In this way, the processes of independence and democratisation were nearly coterminous. East Timor's progress was also complicated by Indonesia's responding to the referendum's outcome by instigating much violence through the militia groups that it controlled. This summoned yet another external actor, the Australian military. It also greatly extended the role of the UN, geared now to restarting the democratisation process by organising founding elections. But if East Timor's democratic transition is complex, an account of the precariousness of the democracy that has been brought about is straightforward. Put simply, given the weakness of institutions and civil society organization, this thesis restores attention to the autonomy and voluntarism possessed by national elites. The hypothesis guiding this thesis, then, is that elites are disunified, but have avoided any return to outright warring. Further, they are at most 'semi-loyal' in their attitudes toward democracy. Accordingly, democracy persists in East Timor, but is subject to many abuses. Thus, most of the research in this thesis seeks to explain elite-level attitudes and relations. In particular, it shows that cooperation between elites and shared commitments to democracy has been hampered by the diversity of their backgrounds. Some elites gained their standings and outlooks under Indonesian occupation. Others gained their statuses because of the guerrilla resistance they mounted against this occupation. The attitudes of other elites were deeply coloured by their experiences in a multitude of countries, including Indonesia, Portugal, Mozambique and Australia. This thesis then demonstrates that these diverse origins and standings have shaped elite attitudes and relations in ways that are unfavourable for political stability and democracy. Under Portuguese rule, three distinct elite groups emerged in East Timor: top government administrators, business elites and young professionals or intellectuals. In the last years of Portuguese domination, they formed some political parties, enabling them to emerge as political elites. Lacking what Higley et al. label structural integration and value consensus, these elites engaged in violent conflict that peaked in brief civil warring and triggered the Indonesian occupation. This elite-level disunity persisted during occupation, with elites continuing to use violence against each other. National elites were also diversified further, with the administrators and resistors joined by pro-Indonesian groups, the Catholic Church group, and nationalist intellectuals, hence extending the range of social origins and ideological outlooks. East Timor finally gained independence in 2002. However, this thesis shows that elite relations still lack integration and consensus. Their country's political frameworks were negotiated by officials from Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the UN. Moreover, even after the referendum sponsored by the UN was held, UN officials in New York overshadowed the preferences and decision making of national elites. This exclusion denied East Timorese elites the opportunity to learn and to habituate themselves in making political decisions based on peaceful dialogue and bargaining. Thus, while the use of overt violence diminished, elites continued to harbour deep suspicions, encouraging their use of manipulations, subterfuge, and violence by proxy in their dealings with one another. In consequence, tensions between elites in East Timor, while stopping short of outright warring, continue to simmer. It is thus uncertain whether, or for how long, these tensions might be contained by the formal institutions and procedures that have been put in place. Analysis is also clouded by the fact that in the wake of independence, still more kinds of elites have appeared on the scene. New fault lines thus stem from generational membership (older and younger), geographic location (diaspora and homegrown), and new kinds of organisational bases (political parties, state bureaucracy, security forces, business, the Catholic Church, and civil society). These elites have only begun to interact with another directly and regularly since East Timor's independence. They find that they possess different outlooks and levels of influence and power. Nonetheless, despite these inauspicious beginnings, it is important to underscore the fact that since independence, elites have refrained from the open warring that they once undertook. This thesis predicts that sustained elite skirmishing, but not open warring, and semi-democratic politics, rather than 'full' democracy or hard authoritarianism will persist. Much should be made clearer, though, by the ways in which the next parliamentary election, due in 2007, is conducted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">East Timor independence</field><field name="subject">political groups in East Timor</field><field name="subject">East Timor politics</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061108.163627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Jerusalem Versus Babylon: Reading the Book of Revelation as the Text of a Circle of Counter-Imperial Christian Communities in the First Century Roman Empire</field><field name="creator">Gwyther, Anthony Robert</field><field name="description">The book of Revelation is perhaps the least understood and most controversial text of the Christian Scriptures. Among the mainstream churches, Revelation has been put into the 'too-hard basket.' Among the more fundamentalist churches, it has been used to construct lurid timetables of the 'end-of-the-world.' The reading of Revelation through modern eyes has tended to sever the text's connections to its original first century audience. In particular, the modern understanding of heaven and earth, the modern conceptualization of time, and the modern demarcation between politics and religion produce interpretations of apocalyptic that are alien to the ideology and worldview of its original author and audience. In this thesis I interpret the book of Revelation as looking not to the end of world history, but as an unmasking of the world dominated by the Roman Empire. In other words, Revelation exposes the claims of empire as illusory, and envisions an alternative reality that claims to be revealed and authorized by God. While this understanding runs counter to the modern 'apocalyptic paradigm,' I believe it is in keeping with the 'total conception of reality' in antiquity.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Revelation</field><field name="subject">Book of Revelation</field><field name="subject">apocalyptic</field><field name="subject">apocalypse</field><field name="subject">Rome</field><field name="subject">Roman Empire</field><field name="subject">Bible</field><field name="subject">New Testament</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030226.092450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and Application of the Isolated Perfused Murine Heart Model and the Role of Adenosine and Substrate During Ischaemia-Reperfusion</field><field name="creator">Hack, Benjamin Daniel</field><field name="description">The Langendorff perfused murine heart has become an increasingly important research model in cardiovascular physiology and pharmacology.  However, the model remains relatively poorly characterised when compared with the widely employed rat preparation.  The purpose of the research within this thesis was initially two-fold: 1) to characterise the functional and substrate-dependent properties of the murine model; and 2) to characterise the relationships between glycolysis, ischaemic tolerance and adenosine-mediated cardioprotection in the mouse. Initial studies, confirmed by simultaneous/subsequent work in other laboratories, revealed the frequent occurrence of regular cyclic oscillations in contractile function and coronary flow in glucose-perfused isovolumically contracting hearts.  This phenomenon (labelled 'cycling') was unaltered by inhibition of ?-adrenergic receptors, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide synthase.  However, A1/A2 adenosine receptor agonism did abolish the oscillations in flow and reduced contractile oscillations by 50%.  Importantly, cycling was eliminated by addition of 50 IU/l insulin to perfusion fluid, or provision of 5 mM pyruvate as a co-substrate with glucose.  These data suggest that functional 'cycling' in glucose-perfused murine hearts likely occurs as a result of a mismatch between substrate metabolism (energy supply) and myocardial energy demand.  It may be that glycolysis with exogenous glucose is insufficient to ensure appropriate matching of myocardial energy supply and demand.  For this reason, it is advisable to employ a co-substrate such as pyruvate in studies of murine hearts.  Further studies performed within this thesis generally employ this co-substrate addition. Addition of pyruvate as co-substrate removes 'cycling' but is also known to inhibit/modify glycolysis, which may affect ischaemic tolerance and/or cardioprotection mediated by adenosine.  Experiments throughout this thesis demonstrated that pyruvate-perfusion improved tolerance to both ischaemia (delayed time to onset of ischaemic contracture; TOC) and reperfusion (reduced diastolic dysfunction and cell death).  The delay in TOC as a result of pyruvate-perfusion also suggests that contracture is not solely influenced by anaerobic glycolysis (as outlined in current paradigms). To test the relevance of glycolysis to ischaemic injury hearts were subjected to various forms of glycolytic inhibition.  Glycolysis was inhibited by use of 10 mM pyruvate,  (iodoacetic acid) IAA treatment, and glycogen depletion by pre-ischaemic substrate-free perfusion (all groups employing pyruvate as sole-substrate).  Each form of glycolytic modification resulted in significant delays in TOC, in complete contrast to findings from other models and species.  Glycogen depletion also reduced the peak level of contracture.  These findings indicate that the mouse is either unique in terms of substrate metabolism and mechanisms of contracture (an unlikely possibility), or raise serious questions regarding current models of contracture development during ischaemia (theorised to be delayed by prolonging anaerobic glycolysis). Modification of glycolysis also altered post-ischaemic outcome, with pyruvate perfusion and glycogen depletion both enhancing functional recoveries.  However, IAA treated hearts, despite near-identical ischaemic tolerance (ie contracture development) to pyruvate-perfused hearts, displayed very poor functional recovery, which was below that for all other groups.  These data clearly reveal that blocking glycolysis improves tolerance to ischaemia (as evidenced by reduced contracture), provide evidence of dissociation of ischaemic injury or contracture from post-ischaemic recovery, and confirm the key importance of glycolysis in enhancing recovery from ischaemia. Since tolerance to ischaemia/reperfusion was shown to be glycolysis dependent, and since it has been theorised that adenosine protects hearts through modulating glycolysis, the relationships between glycolytic inhibition and adenosine-mediated cardioprotection was tested.  In a number of studies, exogenously applied adenosine was shown to protect both glucose- and pyruvate-perfused hearts (supporting no dependence of adenosinergic protection on glycolysis).  However, to more equivocally test the role of glycolysis effects of IAA were studied and were shown to markedly limit protection with adenosine.  The effects of adenosine during ischaemia were abolished by IAA treatment, and effects on post-ischaemic recovery were reduced (but not eliminated).  Similar results were acquired for protection with endogenous adenosine (using iodotubercidin to block adenosine phosphorylation).  Collectively, these data reveal that adenosinergic protection during ischaemia depends entirely upon glycolysis while protection during reperfusion likely involves glycolysis dependent and independent processes.  However, glycolysis is required for full recovery of function during reperfusion. Further studies assessed the involvement of glycolysis in cardioprotection afforded by transgenic A1 adenosine receptor (A1AR) overexpression.  It was found that pyruvate-perfusion provided the same protection as A1AR overexpression, and the two responses (to pyruvate and A1AR overexpression) were not additive.  Thus, it is probable that common mechanisms are targeted in both responses (likely glycolysis). Finally, the effects of adenosine and pyruvate on oxidant injury were studied, testing whether interactions between adenosine and pyruvate observed in prior work within this thesis could be explained by alterations in anti-oxidant responses.  It was found that adenosine has quite profound anti-oxidant responses in glucose-perfused hearts, with very selective effects on markers of damage.  Pyruvate also had some anti-oxidant effects but interestingly it reduced the anti-oxidant effects of adenosine. In conclusion, the work entailed within this thesis demonstrates that the isolated mouse heart model may possess unique properties and should be further characterised by potential users in order to improve its utility, and the reliability of experimental findings (chiefly when studying ischaemia-reperfusion).  Other work within thesis demonstrates that modification of glycolysis is important in dictating recovery from ischaemia-reperfusion, and also impacts on adenosine-mediated protection (principally but not exclusively during ischaemia itself).  The manner in which glycolysis is modified and contributes to protection remains unclear.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Langendorff perfused murine heart</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular physiology</field><field name="subject">glycolysis</field><field name="subject">ischaemic injury hearts</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060810.144732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WinLogiLab - A Computer-Based Teaching Suite for Digital Logic Design</field><field name="creator">Hacker, Charles Hilton</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an interactive computerised teaching suite developed for the design of combinatorial and sequential logic circuits.

This project aimed to investigate the consequences of tourist use of Fraser Island's dune lakes and to develop appropriate monitoring tools and management objectives in light of the projected increases in visitation levels in the foreseeable future. The initial phase of this research aimed to identify the relative importance of some of the most popular dune lakes on the island as key destinations for tourists. Tourist surveys, in conjunction with the development of a Tourist Pressure Index (TPI), which quantifies logistic, social and natural variables, identified Lakes McKenzie, Allom and Birrabeen as the lakes most at risk from excessive tourist use. In addition, analyses of water quality in 15 lakes on Fraser Island aimed to determine the current trophic status of dune lakes on Fraser Island and the ecological implications of tourist use of these systems. Detailed comparisons of nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations in five popular dune lakes in February 1990 (data from Arthington et al. 1990) and February 1999 suggested that productivity has increased significantly in the past decade.  More detailed examinations of nutrient and algal variables in five popular perched dune lakes revealed that while ambient nutrient and phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentrations remained relatively stable, periphyton chlorophyll a concentrations increased over the course of the 1999-2000 summer in most lakes. Significantly, these increases were found only in heavily visited (disturbed) sites in the clear lakes examined (McKenzie and Birrabeen). In these lakes, where algal growth is likely to be only limited by nutrient availability, tourist nutrient additions may stimulate excessive periphyton production. Experimental algal bioassays identified that phytoplankton and to a lesser degree periphyton growth was stimulated by nutrient additions in all five perched dune lakes. However, the degree to which growth was stimulated was both lake and nutrient (nitrogen versus phosphorus versus nitrogen + phosphorus) dependent, highlighting the variable nature of systems within a relatively small geographic range.  Since periphyton biomass was higher in heavily visited areas of lakes and was likely to be stimulated by nutrient additions by tourists, stable isotope analyses of littoral zone food webs were conducted to quantify the percent contribution of periphyton to consumer diets. There was a trend towards higher periphyton contributions in systems identified as key tourist locations (on the basis of their TPI scores) and this indicates that increasing visitation may increase the contribution of periphyton to littoral zone food webs, both via increases in the quantity and quality of periphyton as a food resource.  To further explore the contribution of periphyton in littoral zone food webs of heavily visited lakes, a 15N-tracer addition experiment was conducted to establish the fate of nutrient additions within the littoral zone. Nutrients were added in quantities that mimicked those likely from tourists, to enable a realistic appraisal of the fate of tourist additions. As expected, periphyton rapidly assimilated the added 15N-tracer and was found to be the first and most significant sink for nutrients entering the littoral zone.  Finally, the results from this research were used to develop a conceptual model of nutrient enrichment for perched dune lakes on Fraser Island. The model indicates that although nutrient additions from tourists may lead to undesirable increases in periphyton biomass, the degree to which this is deemed to be a detrimental ecological outcome is likely to be mediated by water level fluctuations and the consumptive capacity of grazers. Given that excessive periphyton growth is likely to be seen as negative impact of tourism, regular periphyton monitoring (biomass and percent contribution to littoral zone food webs) should be built into an updated monitoring program for this series of dune lakes. Whilst the implementation of periphyton monitoring is likely to enable the early detection of deleterious impacts of excessive tourist use, it is likely that the long-term conservation of the region will, in the future, require the implementation of strict visitation level guidelines, to ensure that the irreversible consequences of long term additions of nutrients are ameliorated.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dune lakes</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">impacts</field><field name="subject">nutrient additions</field><field name="subject">food webs</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030304.091718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical and Chemical Behaviour and Management of Intermittently Closed and Open Lakes and Lagoons (ICOLLs) in NSW</field><field name="creator">Haines, Philip Edward</field><field name="description">The term 'Intermittently Closed and Open Lake or Lagoon (ICOLL)' has been adopted in NSW to described wave dominated barrier estuaries with an intermittent connection to the ocean.  ICOLLs can also be found in south east Queensland, south-west Western Australia, and some parts of Victoria and Tasmania, although they are not the dominant estuary type as in NSW.  From an international perspective, ICOLLs are also found in South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico and the Atlantic coast of Brazil and Uruguay. Within NSW, ICOLLs are mostly located south of Sydney, due to the high wave activity and close proximity of the Great Dividing Range to the coast, which results in small coastal catchments and thus small fluvial and sediment runoff.  The distinguishing difference between ICOLLs and other estuary types is the variable condition of their entrances, which also makes them the most sensitive type of estuary to human interference (HRC, 2002; Boyd et al., 1992).  The sensitivity of ICOLLs to external inputs has been described in this thesis based on their morphometric characteristics, which includes their size, shape and predominant entrance condition. NSW ICOLLs exhibit a wide range of physical conditions.  Some ICOLLs are rarely open to the ocean, while others are rarely closed.  Also, some ICOLLs have experienced extensive development within their catchments, while some are located mostly or wholly within National Parks and other protected reserves.  When closed, ICOLLs behave like terminal lakes, retaining and assimilating 100% of the external inputs delivered to the system.  When open, tidal flushing assists with advection and dispersion of inputs, however, significant tidal attenuation across the entrance still limits opportunities for effective removal of pollutants. The majority of NSW ICOLLs are considered to be mostly closed (i.e., have a closed entrance for more than 60% of the time), while remaining ICOLLs tend to be mostly open (i.e., have a closed entrance for less than 20% of the time).  Few ICOLLs have entrances that are open and closed for roughly equal proportions of time, thus resulting in a distinctive bimodal behaviour of entrance condition (i.e., mostly open or mostly closed).  NSW ICOLLs tend to be mostly closed unless (i) the catchment is larger than 100km2, and/or (ii) the exposure of the entrance to ocean swell waves is less than 60 degrees and/or (iii) the entrance channel contains geomorphic controls (e.g. shallow bedrock outcrops). Unless opened artificially, ICOLLs will generally remain closed until a sufficient volume of catchment runoff accumulates within the waterway to increase water levels to a level that overtops (breaches) the entrance sand berm.  Once breached, high velocity flows over the berm cause scour and the development of a formalised entrance channel, which increases exponentially until an optimum width and depth has been reached (determined by the hydrostatic head, geomorphic controls and tidal conditions at the time).  Following entrance breakout and lowering of the lagoon level, sand is reworked back into the entrance under the influence of flood tides and wave processes. The environmental condition of ICOLLs has generally been assumed as being dependent on the state of the catchment and the associated input of nutrients (form and magnitude) to the system.  Biogeochemical processes also are reported to influence the condition of ICOLLs, particularly denitrification, which is controlled by the organic load on the bed and the extent of benthic algae and macrophytic productivity.  In addition to this, however, it is demonstrated that the predominant and prevailing entrance conditions (i.e. open or closed) also influence the physical, chemical and biological environments. ICOLLs are particularly susceptible to the impacts of future climate change.  This thesis provides a description of expected impacts on NSW ICOLLs environments associated in response to future climate changes, based on a detailed appreciation of physical processes and their follow-on consequences.  Impacts on ICOLLs are expected as a result of increasing sea level, altered rainfall patterns, and modified offshore wave climate. A survey of relevant government officials has revealed that more than 50% of NSW ICOLLs are artificially opened before water levels reach the height of the natural entrance sand berm.  Artificial entrance opening is mostly carried out to mitigate inundation of public and/or private assets around ICOLL foreshores, such as roads, backyards, farming lands and on-site sewage (septic) systems.  Truncation of the hydraulic regime of ICOLLs can modify other physical, chemical and biological processes, and can result in deleterious impacts such as the terrestrialisation of estuarine wetlands and foreshores. Few statutory environmental planning mechanisms protect ICOLLs from future degradation.  This thesis has identified the key issues that potentially compromise ICOLL integrity and sustainability, which include the expected future population growth in coastal NSW (thus increasing pressure for intensification of development within ICOLL catchments), future climate change (particularly increases in sea level), and the increased demand for amenity, particularly during summer holiday periods (i.e. 'summer impacts'). A series of management models have been developed to address key issues.  The models comprise a suite of strategies that target future development and existing management practices, through a range of new or modified planning instruments.  Models for the future management of ICOLL entrances aim to prevent artificial openings in the long-term.  This requires, however, the systematic relocation, raising or flood-proofing of public and private assets that have been established on land that is potentially subject to inundation.  Increasing sea levels in the future will compound the need for improved entrance management.  Pro-active, integrated and adaptive management strategies need to be implemented today to minimise the on-going conflict and potential for continued environmental degradation in the future.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intermittently closed and open lake or lagoon</field><field name="subject">ICOLL</field><field name="subject">NSW coastline</field><field name="subject">catchment runoff</field><field name="subject">environmental degradation</field><field name="subject">management of ICOLL's</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070221.132729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Physically Based Model of the Erosion of Cohesive Soils</field><field name="creator">Hairsine, Peter Brian</field><field name="description">A new model of the erosion by water of cohesive soils is developed using physical principles. The theoretical framework which is developed recognises the changing nature of the eroding surface of a soil. Raindrop impact and overland flow are considered to act upon a soil surface so removing soil from the cohesive original (or parent) soil. Once this soil enters the overland flow, either as aggregates or primary particles, it is considered to return to the soil bed, from which it may be re-removed. The development of a deposited layer makes it necessary to distinguish between processes removing sediment from the original soil and those processes removing the deposited layer. This layer, being formed by the relatively gentle action of deposition during the current erosion event, is presumed cohesionless. The physical properties of the original soil and the deposited layer are considered to be very different. The development of two experimental apparatus, a rainfall/runoff simulator and a settling tube for the measurement of aggregate settling velocities, is first described.	Experimental investigations, using these apparatus, and field observations to inform the description of the erosion and deposition processes, are then presented. The processes by which rainfall impact removes sediment from the original soil and the deposited layer are termed rainfall detachment and rainfall re-detachment respectively. Initially, descriptions of these processes in the presence of deposition, are combined in a model describing net rainfall detachment when removal of sediment from the flow bed by overland flow is not occurring. The developriient of the deposited layer is considered both quantitatively and qualitatively. The solution of the equation describing mass conservation is then given for the equilibrium situation when the mass of the deposited layer, and therefore the sediment concentration, is constant with respect to time. The processes by which overland flow removes sediment from the original soil and the deposited layer are termed entrainment and re-entrainment. The work done by the process of entrainment is considered to be done wholly against the cohesive strength of the original soil. In contrast to the process of entrainment, the work done in re-entraining sediment from the deposited layer is considered only to be done against gravity. The resulting description of these processes is then combined with the previous descriptions of rainfall detachment, rainfall re-detachment and deposition and with the equation describing the conservation of mass of sediment within any arbitary number of size (or settling velocity) classes. A plane geometry model Is developed in which the surface water flow is considered to be uniformily distributed across a plane slope on which all processes act. When the mass of the deposited layer is steady, two possible forms of equilibrium are shown to exist. When the coverage of the original soil by deposited layer is partial, the sediment concentration is limited by the removal of the cohesive original soil by entrainment and rainfall detachment, in the presence of deposition. This situation is termed 'source limiting' and is shown to provide a lower limit to sediment concentration. When the coverage of the deposited layer is complete so that entrainment and rainfall detachment of the original soil are considered not to occur, then the ability of the erosive agents to re-entrain and re-detach sediment in the presence of deposition limits sediment concentration. This situation, termed 'transport limiting', is shown to provide a practical upper limit to sediment concentration. This plane geometry flow model is followed by a revised model in which all processes are considered to occur but the flow of water on a plane surface is modified by the formation of rills. In this 'detailed geometry model' the spatial distribution of the erosive agents is shown to have a marked influence on the resulting processes and sediment concentrations. A potential description of the sediment transport across a change in land slope is also developed. Finally, a discussion of this new modelling approach is presented in which the conceptual developments of this thesis are considered and future developments are suggested. This discussion also includes a comparison of the outcomes of this new work with similar erosion models.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cohesive soils</field><field name="subject">water erosion</field><field name="subject">rainfall</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="subject">rainfall detachment</field><field name="subject">rainfall re-detachment</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050826.114613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Today&#146;s Song for Tomorrow&#146;s Church: The Role Played by Contemporary Popular Music in Attracting Young People to Church</field><field name="creator">Hall, Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis is a phenomenology highlighting the phenomenon of declining youth attendance at mainstream churches where traditional church music is used in worship and the emergence of megachurches where young people are attending and contemporary popular styles of music is used in worship.  An Australian Broadcasting Authority survey in 1999 revealed that music is a major influence in the lives of youth, assisting in their identity creation, in their making friends, and in relieving their stress.  The survey also notes that youth prefer contemporary popular music and, in particular, rock.   This is in stark contrast to the traditional music played and sung in mainstream churches, which tends to be neither meaningful nor relevant to youth, largely because they do not identify with it.  An increasing proportion of youth are rejecting the mainstream traditional churches such as Anglican, Catholic, Baptist, Uniting Church.  National Church Life Surveys in Australia show that by 2001, only fourteen percent of church attenders were young adults.  Young non-attenders complained they found church services boring and unfulfilling. This declining youth membership does not auger well for the mainstream church&#146;s future.   It is clearly evident that, in Australian society a culture gap has emerged between the secular world and the mainstream Christian church.  This thesis examines the role of contemporary popular music in attracting young people to church.  Although, in comparatively recent times there has been some movement towards contemporizing worship services in mainstream churches, the change has met strong resistance, but that resistance is based on invalid arguments and the mainstream church is yet to respond effectively to the increasing culture gap and growing alienation of the young. Mainstream congregations are not adequately encouraged to participate in singing praise and thanks to God.  Although the lyrics of songs that focus on thanks and praise can teach a Christian message, as well as promote an awareness of the presence of God, the importance of this aspect of worship appears to have been overlooked, even though music has always been a part of worship, with multiple biblical scriptures cementing its pivotal role.  In 1980 twelve people began Christian City Church (CCC), a new church which was not one of the mainstream churches, with a vision to communicate the Christian message to the whole of Sydney.  CCC used contemporary music as a vehicle to make their message relevant. That church has been strikingly successful, and had grown to five thousand members by 2004.  This thesis focusses on a case study of the music of CCC to test a hypothesis that the use of contemporary popular styles of music, with a focus on thanks and praise, can play a significant role in attracting young people to join and remain as members, and that such music can be influential in communicating an experiential understanding of the Christian message. The aim of the case study was to discover whether the music was similar in style to young people&#146;s preferred styles of music, whether they actively participated in its performance, whether it communicated to them, whether the lyrics conveyed a Christian message, and finally whether the congregation was both increasing and retaining young people as members.  The songs examined in the study revealed that the music and paramusical aspects of the songs were similar to those of contemporary popular songs.  The lyrics of the songs included themes of thanks and praise to God, and as such conveyed a Christian message.  Thirty percent of the worship service was devoted to music praising God, and forty-nine percent of the church&#146;s 5,000 members in 2004, were under twenty-five years.  Further, the congregation participated enthusiastically in singing, an emphasis on belonging to small groups encouraged fellowship, and sermons addressed problems relevant to young people.  It is proposed that CCC provides a pattern that mainstream churches could adapt, including the encouragement of congregational singing and worship, creation of effective small groups, relevant preaching, education opportunities, and culturally appropriate music.  It is clear that contemporary and culturally appropriate music has played a significant and vital role in CCC&#146;s successful development.  To attract and retain youth membership, music needs to be contemporary, and culturally appropriate, thereby filling the gap between the secular world and the church.  Contemporary popular music could provide today&#146;s song for tomorrow&#146;s church.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">church music</field><field name="subject">megachurches</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">contemporary popular music</field><field name="subject">mainstream churches</field><field name="subject">Christian</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070912.141700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation, Human Genomic Research and the Shaping of Health: An Australian Perspective</field><field name="creator">Hallam, Adrienne Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis examines one of the premier "big science" projects of the contemporary era - the globalised genetic mapping and sequencing initiative known as the Human Genome Project (HGP), and how Australia has responded to it.  The study focuses on the relationship between the HGP, the biomedical model of health, and globalisation.  It seeks to examine the ways in which the HGP shapes ways of thinking about health; the influence globalisation has on this process; and the implications of this for smaller nations such as Australia.  Adopting a critical perspective grounded in political economy, the study provides a largely structuralist analysis of the emergent health context of the HGP.  This perspective, which embraces an insightful nexus drawn from the literature on biomedicine, globalisation and the HGP, offers much utility by which to explore the basis of biomedical dominance, in particular, whether it is biomedicine's links to the capitalist infrastructure, or its inherent efficacy and efficiency, that sustains the biomedical paradigm over "other" or non-biomedical health approaches.   Additionally, the perspective allows for an assessment of whether there should be some broadening of the way health is conceptualised and delivered to better account for social, economic, and environmental factors that affect living standards and health outcomes, and also the capacity of globalisation to promote such change.  These issues are at the core of the study and provide the theoretical frame to examine the processes by which Australian policy makers have given an increasing level of support to human genomic research over the past decade and also the implications of those discrete policy choices.  Overall, the study found that globalisation is renewing and extending the dominance of the biomedical model, which will further marginalise other models of health while potentially consuming greater resources for fewer real health outcomes.  While the emerging genomic revolution in health care may lead to some wondrous innovations in the coming decades, it is also highly likely to exacerbate the problems of escalating costs and diminishing returns that characterise health care systems in industrialised countries, and to lead to greater health inequities both within and between societies.  The Australian Government has chosen to underwrite human genomic research and development.  However, Australia's response to the HGP has involved both convergences and variations from the experiences of more powerful industrial nations.  The most significant divergence has been in industry and science policy, where until the mid-1990s, the Australian Government displayed no significant interest in providing dedicated research funding, facilities, or enabling agencies to the emerging field.  Driven by the threat of economic marginalisation and cultural irrelevance, however, a transformation occurred.  Beginning with the Major National Research Facilities Program of the Department of Industry, Science and Technology, and then the landmark Health and Medical Research Strategic Review, support for human genomic research grew strongly.  Comprehensive policy settings have recently been established to promote the innovation, commercialisation, promotion and uptake of the products of medical biotechnology and genomics.  As such, local advocates of a broader model of health will be forced to compete on the political and economic stage with yet another powerful new area of biomedicine, and thus struggle to secure resources for perhaps more viable and sustainable approaches to health care in the 21st century.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human Genome Project</field><field name="subject">HGP</field><field name="subject">genomics</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">governmental</field><field name="subject">response</field><field name="subject">responses</field><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">medicine</field><field name="subject">biomedicine</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">health policy</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">political</field><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="subject">economics</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">globalization</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040812.114745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parents and Adolescent Depression: Evaluation of a Model and an Intervention Program for Parents</field><field name="creator">Ham, David R</field><field name="description">Adolescent depression affects up to 24% of adolescents before adulthood and is linked with serious outcomes.  However as only 25% of affected adolescents in Australia receive appropriate assistance the prevention of adolescent depression has a high priority.  Risk and protective factors exist in the individual, family, school and society, but the connection between these factors is often uncertain.  Prevention at the individual level has been found to be successful but despite the importance of family factors there is little research into prevention at the family level.  Because of the difficulty in engaging parents in preventive interventions it has been suggested that convenient, flexible delivery interventions may achieve better penetration. This study evaluates in two stages the Resourceful Adolescent Parent Program (RAP-P), a positively-focused family-based intervention for parents which has been developed to fill the need for a universal preventive intervention for adolescent depression.  Firstly the study evaluates the theoretical basis for RAP-P by developing and testing models linking the family-based psychosocial risk and protective factors for teenage depression that are addressed by RAP-P, and the family systems factors underpinning these. No previous models linking these variables could be found in the literature.  The study then evaluates two formats of RAP-P, one of three facilitated workshops attended by parents; the other a videotaped flexible delivery format for use at home, developed to overcome parents' poor involvement in preventive programs. Participants were 242 adolescents in Year 8 and 361 of their parents, recruited from eleven schools in Brisbane, Australia.  Schools were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: workshop intervention, video intervention and control.  Adolescents and parents completed measures at pre-test, post-test and 15 month follow-up. Based on the current adolescent depression literature and Bowen Theory, four models were developed, tested using structural equation modeling and confirmed after minor revisions. The first model examined links between adolescents' depression and the family based risk factors of parent-adolescent conflict and adolescents' negative perceptions of their parents' interactions with them, and the protective factor of parental attachment.  Other models, based on Bowen Theory, examined the trans-generational transmission of differentiation of self from the adolescents' grandparents (generation 1) to the adolescents' parents (generation 2) and the effects of parents' differentiation and anxiety on the third generation adolescents' perceptions of their mothers, attachment and depression. The second part of the study examined the implementation and efficacy of the two formats of RAP-P.  Predictions that the convenience of the flexible delivery format of RAP-P would result in better recruitment and lower attrition than for the workshop format were not supported, with the flexible delivery format encountering poorer recruitment and higher attrition.  Predictions that parents' evaluations of both formats would be equally positive were not supported; the flexible delivery format was consistently evaluated less positively than the workshop format.  However parents perceived both formats to be of similar benefit to them. Parents in the intervention conditions were predicted to exhibit better differentiation and lower anxiety than those in the control condition, resulting in their adolescents experiencing less intense conflict over fewer issues and appraising their parents more positively, and consequently exhibiting better parental attachment and lower levels of depression.  The level of improvement was predicted to be related to the level of parental engagement in the interventions.  However parents and adolescents in the intervention conditions did not show any positive effects of the interventions at post-test or follow-up.  Parents who were engaged in the interventions and their adolescents similarly did not show any measurable benefits from the intervention. Thus this study has found support through modeling for the theoretical basis for RAP-P.  Parents' feedback strongly supported the overall thrust and ethos of RAP-P and particularly of the workshop format, indicating that the intervention targeted the right factors in the right way.  However the interventions did not achieve measurable improvements for parents or adolescents within the time frame of the study.  With models supporting the appropriateness of the measured variables it appears that the potency of the intervention was insufficient.  Finally the study found that the use of a flexible delivery videotape intervention did not achieve its goal of increased participation and was still very costly of resources.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adolescent depression</field><field name="subject">RAP-P (Resourceful  Adolescent Parent Program)</field><field name="subject">parents and adolescents</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060901.165611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate Engagement With Planetary Sustainability: The Case of the Non-Renewable Resource Extractive Sector, Australia</field><field name="creator">Harris, Neil David John</field><field name="description">It is increasingly being recognised that global natural resource consumption levels exceed planetary limits and that the present trajectory of industrial development is not sustainable.  To achieve a more viable existence necessitates a fundamental shift in priorities from the prevailing economic growth-centred, consumer driven philosophy to one that marries aspirations for economic growth with long-term environmental and social considerations.  This shift in priorities requires significant contributions and action at the global, national and local levels by the primary 'wheels' of sustainability: government, corporations and civil society.  Over the past 100 years, corporations have become the most powerful institution on the planet with both the financial resources and institutional capacity to take the lead role in shaping a sustainable future for humankind.  Yet, within and between industry sectors and across geographic locations there has been great diversity in the extent and level of corporate commitment and engagement in societal efforts relating to planetary sustainability.  Hence, greater understanding of what drives corporate interest and involvement in ecological sustainability will become increasingly critical to promoting corporate engagement in processes and practices to secure a long-term future for humanity.  However, there has been limited explanatory research oriented upon developing an understanding of the processes and factors associated with corporate 'eco-change'.  In recognition of this shortcoming in the literature, the present study utilised the case of the non-renewable resource extractive sector of Australia to examine corporate engagement with processes and practices for planetary sustainability.  Specifically, it sought to construct and evidence an explanation of the external and internal factors that have promoted and/or retarded corporate engagement with planetary sustainability in the non-renewable resource extractive sector (NRRES) of Australia. Guided by grounded theory methodology, an instrumental case study of the NRRES in Australia was undertaken. The NRRES was chosen as this sector's profile, visibility and activities over the past twenty years have meant it has come under mounting pressure to incorporate the concept and principles of planetary sustainability into its ethos and operations.  As such, the sector represents the opportunity to study this phenomenon within a dynamic context of sectoral and corporate responses to evolving societal expectations.  The research was undertaken in three phases and the principal research method was in-depth key informant interviews with purposively sampled members of the sector's stakeholder groups.  Each NRRES corporation is situated at the centre of a web of interconnected interests or 'stakes' necessitating efforts to balance the various stakeholder interests to maintain the institution's license-to-operate and secure a long-term existence.  The thesis constructs an explanation of the societal drivers of NRRES corporate engagement with planetary sustainability, organised as the three categories of government, civil society and the corporate sector.  These three groupings of stakeholders have been clustered into the broad category or theme of Activating Engagement, which recognises their collective role as the stimuli for NRRES corporation engagement in processes and practices for planetary sustainability.  While the theme of Activating Engagement emphasises the importance and interrelatedness of the roles and actions within and between the three primary wheels of sustainability, of particular note is the evident rise of civil society as a more active societal stakeholder and more salient driver of corporate uptake of social and environmental issues.  As the identified external drivers play a critical role in motivating NRRES corporation engagement, it is a corporation's particular characteristics that ultimately determine the extent and level of uptake of strategies to demonstrate corporate social responsibility. The thesis develops an explanation of the internal factors mediating NRRES corporate engagement comprising the factors of leadership, resources, structures, culture and understanding. These factors are conceptualised as the theme of Capacity for Engagement, which identifies their collective importance in a NRRES corporation's preparedness, impetus and capability relating to interest and participation in planetary sustainability.  While all of the five factors are seen as essential to meaningful NRRES corporate engagement, the thesis identifies leadership as the most critical factor in Capacity for Engagement.  Based on the findings of the research, several explanatory frameworks are developed. These frameworks aid in deepening our understanding of the NRRES corporate engagement process, in particular, the interconnections between the factors impeding and facilitating corporate interest and engagement with processes and practices for planetary sustainability.  As such, these frameworks will make a substantial contribution to building our understanding of how the various factors and their components or 'pieces of the puzzle' interact and interrelate with each other to generate corporate engagement.  The frameworks are the culmination of the research and, coupled with the more detailed explanations of their constituent factors, enhance our knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of NRRES corporation engagement with planetary sustainability.  This enhanced understanding is significant and could be of considerable value in informing and targeting efforts to advance the depth and breadth of NRRES corporation engagement with processes and practices for planetary sustainability. To advance the standing of the study's findings, a series of case studies could be undertaken targeting the investigation of NRRES corporate engagement in other geographic locations and within different industry sectors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural resource consumption</field><field name="subject">planetary sustainability</field><field name="subject">ecological sustainability</field><field name="subject">corporate engagement</field><field name="subject">activating corporate engagement</field><field name="subject">non-renewable resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070109.140640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Musical Participation By Boys: The Role of Gender in the Choice of Musical Activities By Males in Australian Schools</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Scott D.</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to examine the relationship between gender and musical participation by boys. The problem of males' non-participation in certain musical activities has been the subject of research for many years. This thesis considers some of the issues in relation to this phenomenon. The notion of gender is discussed. Historical and contemporary perspectives in stereotyping are investigated to determine the extent of the problem, with a view to enhancing the experience of boys in musical endeavours. There are no studies of this nature in existence in Australia and the existing research from other western cultures, while providing some basis, cannot be directly applied to this setting. Furthermore, existing studies have not brought about significant change in the gender order in music education. This project seeks to address these shortcomings. Masculinity in Australia is examined, with particular emphasis on the effects of hegemonic masculinity on those who do not fit this stereotype. Issues of bullying, depression and suicide are addressed. Empirical and sociological studies are re-examined in the light of more recent thought on the subject, particularly with regard to the possible causes of non-participation in singing and playing of certain instruments.  The extent to which stereotyping of musical activities exists in Australian schools is reviewed through a series of studies of participation and literature. A number of subjects are interviewed to discover some of the reasons behind the choice of particular instruments. The thesis concludes with some perspectives arising from recent case studies of schools that have, to some extent, overcome some of the gender issues raised in earlier discussion. Constructs of masculinity and femininity effect musical participation in Australian schools and the extent of this effect is examined in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="subject">school</field><field name="subject">schools</field><field name="subject">boys</field><field name="subject">male</field><field name="subject">gender role</field><field name="subject">sex role</field><field name="subject">roles</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">instrument</field><field name="subject">instruments</field><field name="subject">singers</field><field name="subject">singing</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040528.142148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of Long Haul Travel on the Marketing of International Tourism</field><field name="creator">Harrison-Hill, Tracey</field><field name="description">Tracking studies conducted by the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) over the last decade have revealed that Australia has a high ranking as a desired destination among US residents. However prior to the peaked effect of the Olympics, this desire had not translated into increasing numbers of visitor arrivals from the US. As travel to Australia from the US is time consuming and involves extremes of physical distance, it would be to Australia's advantage to understand better the dimensions and ramifications of long haul travel with regard to destination choice. This thesis has two objectives: to assess the extent to which a destination being a long haul from its target market affects the choice of this destination; and to consider the marketing implications of the above with a focus on the selection of Australia, as compared to competitive destinations, by the US holiday market. Data were collected from two samples: the West Coast of the US and the East Coast of Australia. The instrument for the US sample collected information on the respondents' choice set structure, attribute importance in selecting a long haul destination, perceptions of the long haul destinations of Australia and Italy, and sociodemographics. The instrument for the Australian sample collected information on the respondents' choice set structure, attribute importance for both long haul and short haul destination selection, perceptions of the long haul destination of the US and the short haul destination of New Zealand, and sociodemographics. This data were then used to test nine hypotheses designed to give insight into the research objectives. The results indicate that tourists place differing degrees of importance on attributes of a long haul destination as compared to a short haul destination for a vacation. It also demonstrates that tourists' perceptions of the distance to destinations are often highly inaccurate and that this inaccuracy is related neither to actual distance nor choice set placement. The cognitive distance is however directly related to perceptions of cost of travelling to the destination. A conundrum was also established in that the distance to Australia was overestimated and related positively with the choice of the destination. Yet at the same time the overestimation led to increasing perceptions of cost, travel time and risk, which indirectly had a negative impact on the choice of the destination. This far-off allure was not evident for the equidistant competitor, Italy, where the cognitive distance was underestimated. It was also found US respondent's place differing importance on the attributes they seek in a long haul destination as compared to the Australian respondents. Notably, the US market places a significantly higher importance on distance, even though their estimation of the distance between Australia and the US did not differ from the Australian estimate. Marketing implications for Australia as a long haul destination were then considered with an emphasis on redefining vacation distances in tourists' minds without relinquishing the far-off allure. The relationship between cognitive distance and perceptions of cost and time in comparison to competitors were driving the need for redefining distance. Emphasis was placed on delivering information to tourists during their decision process when their involvement and information processing was highest. Direction was also given for future research that would be useful for travel marketers in gaining additional insight into their long haul target markets.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Long haul travel</field><field name="subject">tourism marketing</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">United States vacation market</field><field name="subject">cognitive distance</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060104.134512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family Functioning and Anorexia Nervosa: The Issue of Control</field><field name="creator">Hartmann, Peta B.</field><field name="description">This thesis aimed to examine the functioning of families with a sufferer of Anorexia Nervosa (AN), using self-report measures and a direct observation family discussion task.  Researchers and clinicians have long been interested in the interactional patterns of these sufferers within the family unit, although few have furthered our understanding of the interplay between family functioning, cohesion and emotional expression and issues such as control, by directly examining these interactions.  The construct of control has been another area of interest in recent research, although how it is constructed and operates within this disorder remains unclear and ambiguous.  Thus the purpose of this research was to expand the study of adolescents suffering Anorexia Nervosa who still resided within the family unit, from merely studying self-report measures and retrospective surveys of recovery, to include a direct examination of sufferers and their families at the time of the disorder. Participants included 16 female sufferers of Anorexia Nervosa and their parents, 17 drug and alcohol sufferers, and 18 non-clinic families.  Both parents and their daughters completed self-report inventories assessing their clinical status as well as family functioning and marital happiness.  In addition, family members participated in a series of family discussion tasks which were coded for the dimensions of autonomy, cohesiveness, avoidance and control. In Study 1 (Chapter 7), the self-report measures of the anorexic families were examined specifically in relation to the construct of control acting as a mediating variable between level of dysfunction and severity of the disorder.  Consistent with previous research, levels of marital happiness and family cohesion influenced the severity level of the daughter's Anorexia Nervosa.  This study also explored the construct of control within the family system and found that the more moral-religious emphasis in the family, the more concerned the daughter was with her weight.  At the same time daughters were reporting higher levels of moral-religious emphasis, they were reporting higher levels of self-control. The daughters in this study appeared to be inconsistent in their behavioural responses.  The daughters' weight concern increased with their own reported levels of moral-religious emphasis in the family.  However, as this emphasis increased, so too did their control scores.  It was supposed that conflict may be created in a family when strong religious and/or strong moral values are emphasized, particularly when one of the family members suffers AN.  This issue is discussed in depth. Study 2 sought to examine these variables further by using a direct observation family discussion task to compare an independent observer's ratings to the family's ratings of the discussion, across the three groups.  The study examined the daughters' and mothers' perceptions and compared significant results to the observer's ratings.  This study highlighted that the mothers of sufferers appeared not to be concerned about their own bodies and weight, and not distressed when discussing with their daughters the issues of control in the areas of family, body, school and friends.  Furthermore, the anorexic daughters presented as more sad and anxious than the two other groups and indicated that their parents had more control over their bodies than they did themselves.  Finally, for the majority of participating families, the fathers were absent and this issue is explored.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anorexia nervosa</field><field name="subject">anorexic girls</field><field name="subject">family relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030528.124015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Best of Both Worlds: The Application of Traditional Animation Principles in 3D Animation Software</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Louise</field><field name="description">This research assesses the skills and knowledge necessary for the creation of animation in the 3D computer medium. It responds to the argument that students of this new form of animation must learn to apply principles and theories of animation that had their genesis in the early years of traditional, hand-drawn animation (Kroyer, 2002). Many industry notables argue for the use of traditional animation principles in 3D computer animation. John Lasseter, executive vice president at Pixar studios in the United States, represents one such example. He states that 'These principles were developed to make animation, especially character animation, more realistic and entertaining. These principles can and should be applied to 3D computer animation' (Lasseter 1987). The importance of animation principles in all animation mediums is stressed by Oscar-winning traditional animator Gene Deitch.  He states that 'Every animated film made today uses those same basic principles developed at the Walt Disney studios during the 1930s. They still apply, no matter which technology is used' (2001). This research report examines the validity of this argument and identifies the tools, principles, and procedures that professional 3D animators are using. Central to this research is the dynamic of the contemporary relevance of traditional animation as an aesthetic, craft and economic entity. Most importantly this research considers how that dynamic might translate into the teaching of 3D animation courses. It is claimed that the findings of this research benefits 3D animation teachers, students, and those who employ them. To conduct on-site research with professional animators, this study enlisted the participation of a small number of animation studios in south-east Queensland, Australia by ensuring the protection of their Intellectual Property. Close observation of their working practices was made and numerous secondary sources of information (3D animation tutorials, books, DVDs, software manuals etc.) examined in order to locate the tools, processes, and principles that CG animators engaged. The findings were applied and critically assessed by means of a practical project (a seven-minute 3D-animated film) which was created concurrently with the research. Recommendations were formulated as to the most useful tools, processes, and principles for the student of computer animation by way of a revision of the existing Queensland College of Art syllabus for teaching computing animation. What follows is an account of the development and context of the project, the research methods applied, and critical analyses of the findings. The research concludes that it is necessary and advantageous to apply traditional animation skills to 3D computer work.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animation software</field><field name="subject">3D computer animation</field><field name="subject">3D animated film</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070810.105026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music in the Year 8 Classroom: An Action Research Project</field><field name="creator">Hartwig, Kay</field><field name="description">The number of students electing to study music at the Senior Level in Queensland State High Schools has declined over recent years.  Year 8 is the last time that students experience music lessons before being faced with subject choices.  This study investigates the year 8 music program - its content and delivery. What can be done to improve music teaching in year 8?  How can we present experiences at this level that will stimulate students' interest; improve their knowledge and skills; and develop students' aesthetic sensitivity to the art of music? This study involved conducting an action research project in a year 8 music class.  This was done in collaboration with the classroom music teacher and her class of 25 students.  The cyclical process as described by Zuber-Skerritt - acting, observing, reflecting, planning - was adopted. The study aimed: (a) to document positive experiences that could be used in the year 8 music classroom; (b) to stimulate new interest in the studying of senior music; (c) to discover ways to encourage music teachers to become reflective practitioners with a view to improving their practice; (d) to offer an action research model that other music teachers could implement in their classroom.  The data collection involved the keeping of journals by the teacher and researcher; recorded interviews with the teacher and students; videos and photographs of the class; as well as interviews with other year 8 music teachers.  The study identified a negative attitude by music teachers to the teaching of year 8 music.  The dominant theme being taught at this level is Pop Music with a foundation unit being the starting point.  Year 8 students also revealed a negative attitude to music lessons.  This research project has demonstrated that it is possible to set up a program which engages year 8 students in music making and provides them with worthwhile learning experiences.  However, at the end of the project, there was not a significant increase in the number of students electing to study music at the senior level.  The study also set up a model for action research that could be adopted by other music teachers in their classrooms.  The results of reflective practice employed by the researcher and the music teacher provided positive attitudes for other music teachers and encouragement for others to implement this practice in their classroom.  Further studies are needed to involve other music teachers in reflective practice; collaboration in action research (especially in the year 8 classroom); and also the implementation of the new syllabus that will have a positive effect on the future of the subject of music and a positive effect on students' attitudes to the music subject.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="subject">Year 8</field><field name="subject">Grade 8</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">music education</field><field name="subject">music teaching</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">journals</field><field name="subject">journal keeping</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040701.115435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Utility of Linear Riparian Rainforest for Vertebrates on the Atherton and Evelyn Tablelands, North Queensland</field><field name="creator">Hausmann, Franziska</field><field name="description">This study investigated the utility to vertebrates of upland linear riparian rainforest fragments on the Atherton and Evelyn Tablelands in the Australian Wet Tropics region, north Queensland.  Similar linear fragments were selected, that varied in forest age and their connectivity to large areas of continuous forest:- (connected primary (N=6), isolated primary (N=5), connected secondary (N=6) and isolated secondary (N=7)).  Primary sites had either never been cleared or only subject to selective logging, while secondary forest had been completely cleared and allowed to regenerate for at least 30 years.  These linear fragments were contrasted with riparian sites within continuous forest sites (N=6 to 7), which were situated in State Forest or National Parks, and sites within the cleared matrix (pasture, N=6).  Vertebrates surveyed were birds, ground-dwelling mammals and reptiles, particularly leaf-litter skinks.  All surveys were conducted between September and December in 2001 and/or 2000. Chapter 2 investigates the effects of forest age, isolation and structural vegetation features on bird assemblages within linear riparian fragments of rainforest.  Bird surveys and structural vegetation assessments were conducted within connected and isolated primary and secondary linear fragments, and compared with those of continuous forest habitat (N=6) and pasture.  There were strong effects of forest age; all three types of primary rainforest had higher values than secondary rainforest for most measured attributes of vegetation structure (including canopy height and cover; and frequency of large-diameter trees, lianes, epiphytes, strangler figs; and woody debris), but lower frequencies of tree ferns and thorny scramblers.  Sites within primary rainforest also had a greater frequency of many bird species across different guilds of habitat, feeding and movement. Assemblages of rainforest-dependent birds showed an effect of isolation, although its strength was less than that of forest age.  Isolated fragments of primary rainforest differed significantly from continuous primary rainforest in their rainforest-dependent bird species assemblages (and had lower species richness), and isolated fragments of secondary rainforest differed from those that were connected.  There was a significant association between the species composition of rainforest birds and some measured vegetation parameters across all sites, but not within primary or secondary sites.  Vegetation differences did not explain the lowered frequency of several species in isolated fragments.  Limited dispersal seems unlikely to be a main cause, and causal processes probably vary among species.  Specialist rainforest species endemic to the Wet Tropics region showed stronger responses to present-day rainforest age and fragmentation than those not endemic. Variation in nest depredation levels associated with rainforest fragmentation (edge effects) is examined in Chapter 3.  Artificial nests were placed in the forest understorey at seven edge sites where continuous forest adjoined pasture, seven interiors (about one kilometre from the edge), and six primary linear riparian forest remnants (50-100 m wide) that were connected to continuous forest.  Four nest types were compared, representing different combinations of two factors; height (ground, shrub) and shape (open, domed).  At each site, four nests of each type, containing one quail egg and two model plasticine eggs, were interspersed about 15 m apart within a 160 m transect.   Predators were identified from marks on the plasticine eggs.  The overall depredation rate was 66.5% of 320 nests' contents damaged over a three-day period.  Large rodents, especially the rat Uromys caudimaculatus, and birds, especially the spotted catbird Ailuroedus melanotis, were the main predators.  Mammals comprised 56.5% and birds 31.0% of identified predators, with 12.5% of unknown identity.  The depredation rate did not vary among site-types, or between open and domed nests, and there were no statistically significant interactions.  Nest height strongly affected depredation rates by particular types of predator; depredation rates by mammals were highest at ground nests, whereas attacks by birds were most frequent at shrub nests.  These effects counterbalanced so that overall there was little net effect of nest height.  Mammals accounted for 78.4% of depredated ground nests and birds for at least 47.4% of shrub nests (and possibly up to 70.1%).  The main predators were species characteristic of rainforest, rather than habitat generalists, open-country or edge specialists.  For birds that nest in the tropical rainforest understorey of the study region, it is unlikely that edges and linear remnants presently function as ecological population sinks due to mortality associated with increased nest depredation.  The use of linear riparian remnants by small ground-dwelling mammals and reptiles (mainly leaf litter skinks), is reported in Chapter 4.  Site types were continuous rainforest, connected and isolated linear fragments of both uncleared primary rainforest and secondary regrowth rainforest.  Mammals were also surveyed in pasture sites.  Neither reptile species richness nor abundance varied significantly among site types.  Although mammal species richness varied significantly between site types, with isolated primary sites containing highest species richness, overall mammal abundance did not differ significantly among site types.  Pasture sites differed significantly from all rainforest sites in their mammal species composition, and were dominated by the introduced house mouse (Mus musculus).  This species was absent from all rainforest sites, which were characterised by moderate abundances of bush rat/Cape York rat Rattus fuscipes/leucopus, fawn-footed melomys Melomys cervinipes and giant white-tailed rat Uromys caudimaculatus.  None of these species varied significantly in abundance among site types, although the giant white-tailed rat showed a trend (P=0.09) for reduced abundance in isolated secondary sites.  A single reptile species, the prickly forest skink Gnypetoscincus queenslandiae, occurred in sufficient numbers for individual analysis, and its abundance varied significantly among the forested site types, being less abundant in all linear fragments than in continuous forest sites.  The utility of linear riparian rainforest for vertebrates appears to be species-specific and involves many factors.  However, overall, species endemic to the Wet Tropics (which are hence of the highest conservation significance) appear to be the most sensitive to fragmentation.  These species were most likely to show altered abundances or frequencies of occurrence due to isolation, forest age, and habitat linearity.  The ecology of species within this group warrants further investigation within fragmented and non-fragmented regions of the Tablelands.  For many other vertebrates examined in this study, there appears to be sufficient functional connectedness between remnants on the Tablelands to minimise the effects of fragmentation.  Nevertheless, the lower density of many of these species in pasture may indicate that their long-term persistence within the fragmented rainforest areas could benefit from the maintenance or establishment of habitat linkages.  Certainly, if the current rainforest vegetation cover were further reduced, or if the land use in the matrix became more intensive, the establishment of specific habitat linkages could become more important as existing dispersal routes could be lost. It also appears that nest depredation levels are unlikely to limit the value of linear rainforest remnants and other small rainforest remnants as breeding habitat for birds (at least for understorey-nesting species), relative to more intact rainforest, in the study region.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">riparian rainforest</field><field name="subject">rain forest</field><field name="subject">rainforest ecology</field><field name="subject">rain forest ecology</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Atherton Tableland</field><field name="subject">Evelyn Tableland</field><field name="subject">vertebrates</field><field name="subject">forest remnants</field><field name="subject">forest fragments</field><field name="subject">remnant vegetation</field><field name="subject">habitat modificcation</field><field name="subject">habitat loss</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050115.105740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low Energy (e,2e) Studies of Inner Valence Ionization</field><field name="creator">Haynes, Matthew</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a series of electron impact ionization measurements on the gas phase targets of argon and krypton. The (e,2e) coincidence technique has been employed to measure the triple differential cross section (TDCS) using a new coincidence spectrometer designed to operate in the low energy regime (2 to 5 times the ionization energy) and in the coplanar geometry. The spectrometer is a conventional device utilizing a non-energy selected electron gun and two 1800 hemispherical electron analysers fitted with channel electron multipliers for detection of the outgoing electrons. A series of TDCS measurements were performed on the 3s inner-valence and 3p valence orbitals of argon employing coplanar asymmetric kinematics. Measurements for both orbitals were performed at an incident energy of 113.5 eV, ejected energies of 10, 7.5, 5 and 2 eV and a scattering angle of -15&#176;. The energy of the scattered electron in each case was chosen to satis~' energy conservation and is dependent on the ionization energies of the different orbitals. The experimental cross sections are compared to theoretical TDCS calculations using the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) and variations of the DWBA in an attempt to investigate the role that post collisional interaction (PCI), polarization and electron exchange play in describing the TDCS in the low energy regime. To further extend this analysis, a series of TDCS measurements were performed on the 3s and 4s. orbitals of argon and krypton, respectively, employing coplanar symmetric kinematics. Measurements were performed for the 3s orbital at outgoing energies of 50, 20, 10 and 4eV and for the 4s orbital at outgoing energies of 85, 50, 20 and 10 eV. The kinematics were chosen to coincide with several of the (e,2e) measurements made in the same geometry on the 3p orbital of argon by Rouvellou et al (1998). The experimental results were again compared to a DWBA calculation and similar variations to those employed for the asymmetric measurements.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electron impact</field><field name="subject">argon</field><field name="subject">krypton</field><field name="subject">triple differentiation cross section</field><field name="subject">distorted wave Born approximation</field><field name="subject">valence (theoretical chemistry)</field><field name="subject">low energy electron diffraction</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050902.142912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Biological Studies of Soil Microbial Communities Under Different Management Practices in Forest Ecosystems of Queensland</field><field name="creator">He, Jizheng</field><field name="description">Soil microorganisms play important roles in maintaining soil quality and ecosystem health. Development of effective methods for studying the composition, diversity, and behavior of microorganisms in soil habitats is essential for a broader understanding of soil quality. Forest management strategies and practices are of vital significance for sustainable forest production. How the different forest management measures will influence soil microbial communities is a widespread concern of forest industry and scientific communities. Only a small proportion (~0.1%) of the bacteria from natural habitats can be cultured on laboratory growth media. Direct extraction of whole-community DNA from soil, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other analysis circumvents the problems of the culture-dependent methods and may shed light on a broader range of microbial communities in the soil. DNA-based molecular methods rely on high quality soil microbial DNA as template, and thus extraction of good quality DNA from soil samples has been a challenge because of the complex and heterogeneous nature of the soil matrix. The objectives of this research were to establish a set of DNA-based molecular methods and to apply them to investigate forest soil microbial composition and diversity. Soil samples were collected from different forest ecosystems, i.e., the natural forest (YNF) and the first rotation (~ 50 years) (Y1R) and the second rotation (~ 1 year) (Y2R) of hoop pine plantations at Yarraman, and from different forest residue management practices (the experiments had established 6.4 years before the samples were collected) at Gympie, two long-term experimental sites of the Queensland Department of Primary Industry-Forestry in subtropical Queensland, Australia. Some DNA-based molecular techniques, including DNA extraction and purification, PCR amplification, DNA screening, cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses, were explored using Yarraman soil samples, which were high in organic matter, clay and iron oxide contents. A set of methods was assembled based on the recommendations of the method development experiments and applied to the investigations of the microbial composition and diversity of the Yarraman and Gympie soil samples. Four soil DNA extraction methods, including the Zhou method (Zhou et al., 1996), the Holben method (Holben, 1994), the UltraClean (Mo Bio) and FastDNA (Bio 101) soil DNA extraction kits, were explored. It was necessary to modify these methods for Yarraman soil. I designed and introduced a pre-lysis buffer washing step, to partially remove soil humic substances and promote soil dispersion. This modification greatly improved the quality of the extracted DNA, decreasing co-extracted humic substances by 31% and increasing DNA yield by 24%. The improved Holben method was recommended for fungal community studies, and the improved Zhou method for bacterial community studies. The extracted DNA was good in quality, with a consistent size of ~20 kb and a yield of 48-87  g g-1 soil, and could be successfully used for 16S (Zhou method) and 18S (Holben method) rDNA amplifications. For less difficult environmental samples, UltraClean kits could be a good option, because they are simple and fast and the extracted DNA are also of good quality. Screening of the DNA PCR products using TGGE, Heteroduplex-TGGE and SSCP was also explored. These methods were not so effective for the screening of the soil DNA PCR products, owing to the difficulty in interpretation of the results. Cloning was a necessary step to obtain a single sequence at species level in soil microbial community studies. The screening of the clone library by TGGE, Heteroduplex-TGGE and SSCP could only separate the clones into several major bands, although SSCP gave better separation. Sequencing of selected clones directly from the clone library obtained ultimate results of microbial taxonomic composition and diversity through well-established sequence analysis software packages and the databases. It was recommended that, in this project with the target of microbial community composition and diversity, soil DNA PCR products were directly cloned to construct clone libraries and a sample of clones were sequenced to achieve an estimate of the taxonomic composition of the soil. Fungal communities of the Yarraman soil samples under the natural forest (YNF) and the hoop pine plantations (YHP) were investigated using 18S rDNA based cloning and sequencing approaches. Twenty-eight clone sequences were obtained and analysed. Three fungal orders, i.e., Zygomycota, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were detected from the YNF and YHP samples. By contrast, culture-based analyses of fungi in the literature were mostly Ascomycetes. YNF appeared to have more Ascomycota but less Zygomycota than YHP, and within the Zygomycota order, YHP had more unidentified species than YNF. Bacterial communities of Yarraman soil samples of YNF, Y1R and Y2R were investigated using 16S rDNA-based cloning and sequencing approaches. 305 16S rDNA clone sequences were analysed and showed an overall bacterial community composition of Unclassified bacteria (34.4%), Proteobacteria (22.0%), Verrucomicrobia (15.7%), Acidobacteria (10.2%), Chloroflexi (6.9%), Gemmatimonadetes (5.6%), and Actinobacteria (5.2%). There was a significant difference among YNF, Y1R and Y2R in the taxonomic group composition. YNF had a greater proportion of Acidobacteria (18.0%), Verrucomicrobia (23.0%) and Chloroflexi (9.0%) than Y1R and Y2R (corresponding to 6.3%, 12.1% and 5.9%, respectively), while Y1R and Y2R had a higher percentage of the Unclassified group (38.5% for Y1R and 46.5% for Y2R) than YNF (18.0%). For the Proteobacteria group, YNF had more Alpha-subdivision but Y1R and Y2R had more Delta-subdivision. From YNF to Y1R to Y2R, the clone sequence variable site ratios, 5% and 10% OTU numbers and Shannon's diversity index H' values tended to decrease, indicating the soil bacterial diversity decreased from the natural forest to the first and the second rotation hoop pine plantations. The large amount of unclassified clone sequences could imply a novel group of bacteria in the soil, particularly in the hoop pine soil samples. Alternatively they may result from artefacts during the PCR process. Bacterial communities of the Gympie soil under different residue management practices, i.e., residue (litter plus logging residue) removed (G0R), residue retained (G1R), and residue doubled (G2R), were also investigated using the 16S rDNA-based cloning and sequencing approaches. Acidobacteria (37.6%) and Proteobacteria (35.6%, including Alpha-subdivision of 29.9% and Gamma-subdivision of 5.7%) were dominant components of the communities, followed by Actinobacteria (14.7%), Verrucomicrobia (7.3%) and Unclassified bacteria. There was no significant difference among G0R, G1R and G2R in the bacterial community compositions and diversity. These findings provided an in-depth vision of the soil microbial communities under different forest management practices. Their combination with other soil analysis results, such as physical and chemical properties, and forest production data, could provide an improved understanding of sustainable forest management strategies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil microorganisms</field><field name="subject">forest management strategies</field><field name="subject">soil samples</field><field name="subject">soil DNA</field><field name="subject">forest ecosystems (Queensland)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060309.095702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovering Discourses of Citizenship Education: In the Environment Related Sections of Australia's  'Discovering Democracy School Materials' Project.</field><field name="creator">Heck, Deborah Anne</field><field name="description">This study explores the impact of neoliberal education policies on the discourses of citizenship and citizenship education in an Australian citizenship education project entitled 'Discovering Democracy School Materials.' This project is the largest national curriculum development project in Australia and represents the official discourses of citizenship in Australia. The materials were developed in response to concern about the poor understanding of civics and citizenship in Australia and the lack of quality citizenship education materials and background information for teachers. The scope of the study was managed by focusing on a corpus of twelve text groups, selected from the materials because they related to the environment - an area of citizenship of interest to young people and which allows consideration of recent trends in the practice of citizenship. An approach to critical discourse analysis recommended by Fairclough (1992) was used. This involved a three-step process of identifying and analysing: (i) the discourse evident in the words in the text, (ii) the processes of production, dissemination and consumption of the texts, and (iii) the contextual social and cultural practices that influenced the development of the text. There were six steps in the discourse analysis. The first involved identifying the corpus related to the environment. The second was to identify and describe the discourses of citizenship and citizenship education evident in the text. The third involved interviewing key participants in the processes of text production, dissemination and consumption to ascertain their perceptions of the discourses evident in the texts. The fourth was an analysis of these interviews to interpret the discourses participants acknowledged as being within the text and the discursive practices that operated to establish those discourses. The sixth was an explanation of the impact of neoliberalism on the development of the materials. The results indicate that two discourses of citizenship and citizenship education were dominant within the materials - Legal Status and Public Practice. The same two discourses were evident in the interviews with key participants in the processes of text production, dissemination and consumption. In all cases, the materials lacked any evidence of the citizenship or citizenship education discourses of Democratic Identity, World Citizenship and Democratic Participation, although Democratic Identity was a minor aspect of one of the twelve text groups. A range of discursive practices related to neoliberalism was identified as influential on this pattern of discourses. Perceptions of teacher deficiency were influential in the process of text production as was the power of key individuals and groups such as the national education minister and his department, a government-appointed Civics Education Group, the Curriculum Corporation and, to a much lesser extent, teacher professional associations. Two discursive practices were influenced in text dissemination: the materials were provided free of charge to all schools and extensive professional development was provided. These provided significant inducements to teachers to use the materials. Discursive practices operating in the process of text consumption provided added inducement by showing teachers how to select key components of the materials for local use. However, this concern for local context was undermined by the extreme strength of the presentation of what counts as legitimate citizenship and the lack of opportunity for alternative or resistant readings of the texts. Three aspects of neoliberalism were seen as especially influential in these discursive practices - the strong focus on the development of legitimate knowledge, marketisation, and an emphasis on the need for evaluation.  The study concludes with an examination of the implications of the findings to identify recommendations for teachers, teacher educators, materials developers and opportunities for further research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">citizenship education</field><field name="subject">civics education</field><field name="subject">education policy</field><field name="subject">neoliberalism</field><field name="subject">neo-liberalism</field><field name="subject">curriculum development</field><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030905.115718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Booth to Shop to Shopping Mall: Continuities in Consumer Spaces from 1650 to 2000</field><field name="creator">Henderson-Smith, Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to evaluate the role of consumer spaces in twentieth-century daily life. It is not concerned with the act of consumption but rather with the ways in which the social, cultural and educative role of the retail spaces is used as a marketing tool. The links that have been established between civic and commercial space over the last three hundred years are charted in order to locate the reasoning behind the growing tendency to design shopping malls as social and cultural spaces in the twentieth century. Three principal benefits to developers of the retails spaces from the promotion of consumer spaces as public spaces are identified in the thesis. First, links between the public and commercial developed to encourage potential customers into a particular retail space as opposed to its competition. Second, consumer spaces are developed as social and leisure spaces to encourage consumer loyalty. That is, they are developed as a means of encouraging repeat visits. Third, they are developed as a tactic to keep potential shoppers in the retail space for a longer duration. The logic behind this strategy being the more time spent in a consumer space the more goods purchased. The origins of this merchandising practice are traced back to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries well before the advent of the department store form. The thesis located a number of strategies developed in the seventeenth century by tradesmen and merchants to sell their wares. At this time, it is evident that the consumer space was opened up to the public who were encouraged to enter without the obligation to purchase. Further, it is evident that, by the eighteenth century, shopkeepers and manufacturers' workshops included showrooms where potential customers could sit and take tea. Public spaces were also designed within the retail space so that potential customers could see and be seen. British shopkeepers often linked the retail space with the social practice of promenading by strategically situating their premises in an already established thoroughfare or site used for promenading. By the late eighteenth century, consumer spaces housed entertainment facilities such as art galleries, exhibitions and lounging rooms.  After tracing the development of this merchandising strategy to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the links that can be made between twentieth-century consumer spaces is examined. In addition, the early developments of shopping centres in the 1940s and 1950s are surveyed and their developmental logic and merchandising strategies are compared with more recent forms of shopping malls developed from the 1970s and 1980s.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer spaces</field><field name="subject">consumption</field><field name="subject">shopping</field><field name="subject">spectacle</field><field name="subject">shopping malls</field><field name="subject">department stores</field><field name="subject">urban planning</field><field name="subject">consumer education</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">shopping centres</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040618.134501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predation, Palatability and the Distribution of Tadpoles in the Amazon Rainforest</field><field name="creator">Hero, Jean-Marc</field><field name="description">A variety of aquatic habitats with different levels of potential predators are available to larval amphibians in Central Amazon rainforest. The anuran community at Reserva Florestal Adolfo Ducke, 25 km east of Manaus, Amazonas, Brasil, was studied to determine which species have eggs and/or larvae in water and how those larvae are distributed in time and space. The temporal and spatial distribution of potential predators as well as abiotic characteristics of these waterbodies were determined simultaneously to test for correlations with the distribution of tadpoles. The distribution of tadpoles was strongly related to fish predation pressure. Several tadpole species were found only in waterbodies with high fish abundance and thus have the ability to survive with fish. Most of these tadpoles were found to be unpalatable in controlled experiments. Unpalatability is the major adaptation allowing the coexistence of tadpoles and fish and is thus a major factor affecting tadpole community composition in this system. Controlled experiments showed that fish do not eat anuran eggs while the tadpoles of Leptodacrylus knudseni and Osteocephalus taurinus ate all types of eggs offered. The percentage of anurans with aquatic oviposition was positively related to fish abundance and negatively related to the occurrence of species of tadpole that ate eggs in experiments. These findings suggest that the present patterns of anuran distribution represent an evolutionary response to predation on the eggs and larvae. Contrary to the models of Heyer et al. (1975) and Wilbur (1984), desiccation and predation-pressure were not the major factors affecting species richness within waterbodies of the RFAD rainforest. In support of the model of Heyer et al. (1975), anuran species richness was correlated with the size of the waterbody. This could be because the size of the waterbody is related to increased complexity and availability of microhabitats. The range of volumes of waterbodies was also found to directly affect species richness of the RFAD community. While predation appeared to have a limited effect on species richness of individual ponds, predation-pressure was found to have a major influence on species composition. Anuran eggs and larvae survived with specific predators by possessing particular survival-traits (e.g. unpalatability and oviposition strategies). However, survival-traits were not effective against all predators in all habitats. The distribution of different predators among ponds provides a patchy environment on a local scale (i.e. within ponds). When combined with the variety of survival-traits exhibited by the anuran species, this spatial patchiness in predation contributes towards species richness within the anuran community of the RFAD rainforest.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reserva Florestal Adolfo Ducke</field><field name="subject">tadpoles</field><field name="subject">Leptodactylus knudseni</field><field name="subject">Osteocephalus taurinus</field><field name="subject">anurans</field><field name="subject">Amazon rainforest</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050902.155749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Talking' and 'doing' gene technology politics: a policy analysis</field><field name="creator">Heywood, Jacqualine</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the environmental politics surrounding agricultural biotechnology innovations and diffusion.  Recent developments in agricultural biotechnology are accompanied by growing social concerns that such innovations pose risks to the environment and to human health.  Biosafety is a term used to discuss the possibility of such risks.  Currently, the regulation of agricultural gene-technology and biosafety are contentious environmental issues for national and international policy communities.  However, detailed studies of the conflicts and complexities generated by biotechnology for environmental governance are scarce.  In particular, little is understood of the ways in which biotechnology issues emerge on regulatory agendas, and research gaps remain on how differing perspectives of biotechnological risks impact on policy outcomes. This thesis makes a significant contribution to these outstanding research issues.  My contribution is a new analytical framework that unearths the discursive role biotechnology plays in constructing international environmental policy regimes.  I develop this framework on the understanding that the use of language resources like storylines, metaphors and other rhetorical devices are critical in shaping environmental policy in general and biotechnology governance in particular.  This analytical framework couples a language analysis to an investigation of the practices of institutional power.  The result is a discourse analysis that provides important and useful insights into the theory and practice of biosafety policy.  In other words, my thesis explores both the &#145;talking&#146; and the &#145;doing&#146; of policymaking and thereby provides new insights into the contested and uncertain environmental policy area of international gene-technology regulation. Specifically, I undertake a discourse analysis of international biosafety politics within the Convention on Biological Diversity.  I apply my discourse analysis to a case study: the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2000.  My research provides a different reading of international gene-technology politics, one that questions the constructed nature of biotechnology as a policy problem and reveals the power relations involved in producing particular policy options and outcomes on biosafety. There are a number of key research findings that emerged from the application of my discursive analytical framework to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. I find that biosafety is a highly fluid concept.  It can enlarge or contract depending on the way in which language resources are mobilised by policy actors and interest groups to secure definitions and generate consensus around their preferred understandings of biosafety.  Moreover, my research indicates that the more radical texts for biosafety can be recast by dominant interest groups into scripts for shallow reform agendas.  Institutionalised policy practices also effect policy outcomes.  My research finds that the use of Expert Panels, for example, is important in shaping international policy communities&#146; understanding of the policy problems posed by biotechnology risks. In the light of these findings, my thesis argues that the ability of interest groups and policy actors to win language games within institutional settings also enables them to secure their preferred policy outcomes.  I import the concept of authorship as a new policy concept to discuss the ways in which such groups exercise social power to secure their understanding of biosafety, which thereby effect the &#145;writing&#146; of the dominant accounts of what constitutes an acceptable international biosafety standard within the Cartagena Protocol.  In short, my thesis is a new account of biosafety politics that fills some of the current knowledge gaps about how biotechnology is emerging onto regulatory agendas. It also demonstrates the mechanisms of power and the language struggles that determine biosafety policy outcomes within multi-lateral environmental agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gene technology</field><field name="subject">genetic technology</field><field name="subject">agricultural biotechnology</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">regulation</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">political</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">biosafety</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">risks</field><field name="subject">standard</field><field name="subject">standards</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">authorship</field><field name="subject">writing</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041029.100010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination of the Influence of Cannabis Use on Psychotic Symptom Exacerbation and Relapse in Early Psychosis</field><field name="creator">Hides, Leanne</field><field name="description">There has been concern about the impact of cannabis use on the onset, course and relapse of psychosis.  Evidence from retrospective and a small number of prospective studies has suggested that cannabis use may precipitate a latent psychosis, exacerbate psychotic symptoms and increase the likelihood of psychotic relapse.  The purpose of the current study was to examine the influence of cannabis use on psychotic symptom exacerbation and relapse within the stress vulnerability-coping model of psychosis.  Two studies were conducted.  The influence of cannabis use on the onset and course of psychosis was retrospectively examined in the first study.  The second study prospectively examined the influence of cannabis use on psychotic symptom exacerbation and relapse over a 6-month period.  The influence of the severity of psychotic symptoms on a relapse in cannabis use was also explored.  Eighty-four participants were assessed at admission, 81 of whom were followed up for a 6-month period.  Measures consisted of structured diagnostic interviews and self-report measures of stress, medication compliance, family functioning, premorbid adjustment, quality of life, substance use and psychotic symptoms.  The onset of cannabis use clearly preceded the onset of psychosis.  Cannabis use was predictive of the severity of psychotic and general psychopathology symptoms at admission.  Both the frequency and quantity of cannabis use was predictive of time to psychotic relapse over the 6-month follow up period.  Psychotic symptom severity was predictive of a substantial increase in the quantity but not the frequency of cannabis use.  Cannabis use was related to the onset, course and relapse of psychosis.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychosis</field><field name="subject">psychoses</field><field name="subject">psychotic symptoms</field><field name="subject">cannabis</field><field name="subject">marijuana</field><field name="subject">relapse</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030922.130049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distance and Tracking Control for Autonomous Vehicles</field><field name="creator">Hitchings, Mark R.</field><field name="description">The author's concept of the distance and tracking control problem for autonomous vehicles relates to the cooperative behaviour of two successive vehicles travelling in the same environment. This behaviour requires one vehicle, designated the leader to move autonomously around it's environment with other vehicles, designated followers maintaining a coincident travel path and desired longitudinal distance with respect to the leader. Distance and tracking control is beneficial in numerous applications including guiding autonomous vehicles in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) which increases traffic safety and the capacity of pre-existing road infrastructure. Service robotics may also benefit from the cost savings and flexibility offered by distance and tracking control which enables a number of robots to cooperate together in order to achieve a task beyond the capabilities ofjust one robot. Using a distance and tracking control scheme an intelligent leader robot may guide a number of less intelligent (and therefore less costly and less complex) followers to a work-site to perform a task. The author's approach to the distance and tracking control problem consisted of two separate solutions - an initial solution used as a starting point and learning experience and a second, more robust, fuzzy control-based solution. This thesis briefly describes the initial solution, but places a greater emphasis on the second solution. The reason for this is that the fuzzy control-based solution offers significant improvement on the initial solution and was developed based on conclusions drawn from the initial solution. Most implementations of distance and tracking control, sometimes referred to as Intelligent Cruise Control (ICC) or platooning, are limited to longitudinal distance control only. The leader tracking control is performed either implicitly by a separate lane-following control system or by human drivers. The fuzzy control-based solution offered in this thesis performs both distance and tracking control of an autonomous follower vehicle with respect to a leader vehicle in front of it. It represents a simple and cost effective solution to the requirements of autonomous vehicles operating in ITS schemes - particularly close formation platooning. The follower tracks a laser signal emitted by the leader and monitors the distance to the follower at the same time using ultrasonic ranging techniques. The follower uses the data obtained from these measuring techniques as inputs to a fuzzy controller algorithm to adjust its distance and alignment with respect to the leader. Other systems employed on road vehicles utilise video-based leader tracking, or a range of lane-following methods such as magnetometer or video-based methods. Typically these methods are disadvantaged by substantial unit and/or infrastructure costs associated with their deployment. The limitations associated with the solutions presented in this thesis arise in curved trajectories at larger longitudinal distance separations between vehicles. The effects of these limitations on road vehicles has yet to be fully quantified, however it is thought that these effects would not disadvantage its use in close formation platooning. The fuzzy control-based distance and tracking control solution features two inputs, which are the distance and alignment of the follower with respect to the leader. The fuzzy controller asserts two outputs, which are left and right wheel velocities to control the speed and trajectory of a differential drive vehicle. Each of the input and output fuzzy membership functions has seven terms based around lambda, Z-type and S-type functions. The fuzzy rule base consists of 49 rules and the fuzzy inference stage is based on the MAX/MIN method. A Centre of Maximum (CoM) def'uzzification method is used to provide the two crisp valued outputs to the vehicle motion control. The methods chosen for the fuzzy control of distance and tracking for autonomous vehicles were selected based on a compromise between their computational complexity and performance characteristics. This compromise was necessary in order to implement the chosen controller structure on pre-existing hardware test beds based on an 8-bit microcontrollers with limited memory and processing resources. Overall the fuzzy control-based solution presented in this thesis effectively solves the distance and tracking control problem. The solution was applied to differential drive hardware test-beds and was tested to verify performance. The solution was thoroughly tested in both the simulation environment and on hardware test-beds. Several issues are identified in this thesis regarding the application of the solution to other platforms and road vehicle use. The solution will be shown to be directly portable to service robotics applications and, with minor modifications, applicable to road vehicle close-formation platooning.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autonomous vehicles</field><field name="subject">tracking control</field><field name="subject">intelligent cruise control</field><field name="subject">fuzzy controller algorithm</field><field name="subject">intelligent vehicles</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050902.084155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How can Photographic Practice Assist our Quest for Intimacy with an Ideal Other?</field><field name="creator">Hobson, Stephen John</field><field name="description">This research undertaken through photographic studio practice and theory is the culmination of a four-year study into the nature of intimacy that answers the question: How can photographic practice assist our quest for intimacy with an ideal Other?  Working closely with a number of adult volunteer participants living in South-East Queensland, the work commenced by mapping the intimate relationships between people, objects and space in bedrooms. Some of the initial works dealt with notions of sexual intimacy, because this is the most common understanding of intimacy in our society today, but the bedroom is also the place for other kinds of intimacy, such as contemplation or reading, and whether we are young or old, bedrooms are also used as a repository for intimate keepsakes and mementos. Intimacy is difficult to define, and furthermore, the meaning of the term has changed over the centuries. Intimacy is not a place, or a thing, or a person. One of the better definitions, by Thomas Moore, states, &#145;The word intimacy means &#145;profoundly interior.&#146; It comes from the superlative form of the Latin word inter, meaning &#145;within.&#146; It could be translated &#145;within-est,&#146; or &#145;most within.&#146; In our intimate relationships, the &#145;most within&#146; dimensions of ourselves and the other are engaged&#146;. Therefore, it is a feeling that we might recognise in a moment with a partner, or a particular landscape, or the thoughts evoked by an object like a photograph, and most often these feelings concern ourselves and other people. While accepting that most photography (and human experience for that matter) is not intimate, snapshot and documentary portraiture often record moments of intimacy, revealing for example, the expression of another person&#146;s face and subverting the barriers that usually mask our inner selves. But the photography in this project refused the relatively easy option of portraiture. Instead, in its final form, it sought to develop responses from the viewer to unusual conjunctions of skin and cloth &#150; that evoke looking, touch and shape &#150; and by implication suggest more historic ideas of intimacy than those commonly based on sexual intimacy today. The work shows that intimacy has aspects to it that are uncanny (in the Freudian sense), that intimacy does not always have to be invested in interpersonal human relationships, and that keeping aspects of oneself from others and knowing oneself can offer a richer experience of intimacy than giving oneself in the all-or-nothing tradition of Romanticism.  The research also demonstrates that scholarly and common notions of intimacy &#150; based respectively on interpersonal relationships and sex &#150; are often reductive and partial within a desire for an authentic experience of intimacy, because they are usually based on the binary oppositions that underpin Western thought. To counter these tendencies, the theory and practice in this research evidences a &#145;middle way&#146; &#150; centred on androgyny within male psychosexual development, expressed through the psychological theories of the desire between the Self and Other &#150; that can collapse the binary oppositions of masculine/feminine and thereby offer new insights into gender, self and interpersonal relationships. These ideas are suggested by the studio practice that constitutes the final body of artworks &#150; the Intimacy Series &#150; plus the analytical and theoretical research that supports my conclusions, and my observations of the responses to the works by audiences at exhibitions. In my experience, the mix of pleasure, intrigue and uncertainty that audiences exhibit suggests that they are often &#145;caught&#146; by the Lacanian gaze of the artworks, which suggests a more complex range of characteristics within intimacy than is usually recognized today.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photographic Practice</field><field name="subject">intimacy</field><field name="subject">society</field><field name="subject">an ideal Other</field><field name="subject">South-East Queensland</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070824.160040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linking Marketing to Shareholder Value in Listed and Non-Listed Markets</field><field name="creator">Hodgson, Victoria Louise</field><field name="description">In this thesis it is recognised that marketing has a dual role to satisfy both customer and shareholder objectives.  The issue of shareholder value creation of marketing is an important and immediate agenda for marketing executives, management and academics.  To date, marketers have not been able to adequately quantify and measure shareholder value creation through marketing assets and marketing expenditure.  This has led to a dilution of marketing power and influence in the boardroom with management tending to treat marketing as discretionary expenditure and not as an asset.  Academics have responded with conceptual models that relate marketing assets back to shareholder value, generally through cash flow or sales models.  The creation of shareholder value through marketing assets and expenditure is then conceptualised and tested empirically.  The conceptual model builds on the theory of agency and incomplete markets setting to illustrate the flow effects through marketing assets to shareholder value.  The conceptual model also demonstrates that marketing expenditure can have stock and/or flow impacts on shareholder value.  Flow effects are indirect effects that are mediated through sales, cash flows, and earnings and can be either temporary or longer term.   It is concluded that in listed markets stock prices are the general surrogate for shareholder value, and risk adjusted earnings are the appropriate surrogate in non-listed markets.  The thesis then empirically illustrates and tests the relationships between marketing communications expenditure on two data sets representing firms in listed and non-listed settings.  The empirical results reveal that marketing expenditure does play an important role in the creation of shareholder value and that stock and flow effects are both present.  Knowledge of the various empirical impacts from marketing across firm size, industry and listed and non-listed market settings observed in this thesis should prove highly valuable for marketers and managers.  Finally, a conceptual understanding by marketers of the financial metrics that are required to be influenced in order to increase shareholder equity will provide greater clout in negotiations with management and boards of directors.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">marketing assets</field><field name="subject">marketing expenditure</field><field name="subject">listed markets</field><field name="subject">non-listed markets</field><field name="subject">shareholders</field><field name="subject">shareholder value creation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040116.094444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Internet as a Research and/or Communication Tool to Support Classroom-Based Instruction: Usage, Value, and Utility for Post-Secondary Students</field><field name="creator">Hogan, Bernard Michael</field><field name="description">Recent research indicates that the Internet (or Net) is currently being used at many post-secondary institutions in support of traditional, classroom-based instruction. From 1994 to 2002, the percentage of post-secondary classes using the Web as a research tool and E-mail as a method of communication has increased almost ten fold. An extensive literature on the evaluation of the Internet as an educational technology has developed in recent years; however, there are some gaps that need to be filled to provide a more complete understanding of the Internet and its use by post-secondary students. First, most of the studies focus primarily on student usage of the Net, and less so on the value (or the advantages and disadvantages) and the utility (or usefulness) associated with that usage. Second, many of these studies make a distinction between the research and communication functions of the Internet. While I argue that this is an appropriate distinction, many examine one function or the other only &#150; and not both simultaneously. The central research problem that this study addresses is helping to fill those two gaps in the evaluation literature by examining in detail student usage, value and utility of the Net as a research and/or communication tool for post-secondary students in support of classroom-based instruction. Drawing upon work from the fields of media studies, learning theory, and theories of communication, I establish a "Net as Tool" framework and adopt a uses and gratifications approach to examine student use of the Net. The three main inter-related concepts of usage, value and utility are used as organizing themes for the study, and I designed and developed a survey instrument to gather original quantitative data from post-secondary students in both Canada and Australia to fully examine those concepts. Two focus group sessions were designed to supplement this quantitative data with qualitative findings (and to generate more in-depth insights into student usage, value and utility of the Net as a research and/or communication tool). The results presented in this study have both theoretical and practical importance. In regards to the theoretical side, I have identified the underlying dimensions of usage, value, and utility, and highlighted what makes the Net valuable and useful as a research and/or communication tool. Additionally, I have identified the factors which are related to usage, value, and utility, and explored the inter-related nature of those three concepts. I concluded my study with an outline of the importance of the skill of digital literacy so that students can cope effectively with the online environment. These findings are significant because they help to fill some specific gaps in the evaluation knowledge of the Net in post-secondary education. In addition, I have developed a practical strategy which suggests how the Net could be used most effectively by students as a research and/or communication tool in support of classroom based instruction. The areas addressed by the strategy include access, infrastructure, technical support, training, integration into the curriculum, and appropriate use of the tool. The overall strategy is important because it contributes to our understanding of the Net as an educational tool, and it outlines ways to address the issue of the digital divide within post-secondary education. It is hoped the strategy will be useful to training staff, post-secondary administrators, instructors, and students.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">World Wide Web</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">post-secondary</field><field name="subject">tertiary</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">higher</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">communcation</field><field name="subject">use</field><field name="subject">usage</field><field name="subject">Canada</field><field name="subject">Canadian</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">classroom-based instruction</field><field name="subject">educational</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">focus group</field><field name="subject">focus groups</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040719.124141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clines, Species and Eucalypts: An Evolutionary Perspective</field><field name="creator">Holman, James</field><field name="description">Two eucalypt clines were examined using morphological, ecophysiological and molecular analyses.  The species complexes examined were an ironbark complex (Eucalyptus melanophloia x E. whitei) and a box complex (E. brownii x E. populnea).  Both of these complexes demonstrate continuous morphological variation across their clines.  The origin of these morphological clines has previously been interpreted as the product of secondary contact between allopatric species.  In this study, an analysis of morphological variation across the clines did not identify an increase in trait variance in the intermediate populations, which suggests that previous theories concerning the origin of these clines may not be valid. Genetic structuring in nuclear and chloroplast DNA was examined across the clines to investigate whether the morphological clines were the product of secondary contact between two independent evolutionary lineages, or whether the clines represent a single evolutionary lineage that has undergone primary differentiation.  The microsatellite analyses indicated that there was little genetic structuring across either cline, and that there were only low levels of population differentiation.  The lack of hierarchical structuring in the distribution of nuclear genetic variation suggests that these clines are unlikely to be the product of recent gene flow between two formerly allopatric species/populations.  A nested clade analysis of the JLA+ region of the cpDNA provides additional evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the morphospecies classifications represent distinct evolutionary lineages.  Instead the analyses indicate that each cline represents a single cohesion species and a single evolutionary lineage.  The phylogeographic distribution of cpDNA haplotypes is likely to have resulted from restricted seed mediated gene flow with isolation by distance.  A more cogent explanation for the clines, based on the genetic data, is that they have arisen through the process of continuous morphological diversification that has been promoted by a directional selection gradient. Drought experiments were conducted in the glasshouse to investigate whether differences in physiological performance under water stress helps to explain the maintenance of the ironbark cline.  Under increasing water stress, the morphotypes showed differences in their ability to maintain water status and photosynthetic rates, yet there was no obvious pattern to these differences across the cline.  Physiological differences are therefore inadequate to explain the maintenance of the ironbark cline and highlight the compensatory role that morphological variation may play in alleviating water stress. The value of adopting the cohesion species concept and a hypothesis-testing framework to assess species status is demonstrated in this study.  This framework provided a statistical approach to distinguish independent evolutionary lineages from interspecific populations and provides evidence to refute the current species status of the species complexes studied.  Eucalypt classification is predominantly based on morphology, which results in taxonomic classification that may not reflect genealogical relationships.  This is due to the disparity between morphological and phylogenetic relationships.  I therefore suggest that current presumptions regarding the prevalence and importance of hybridisation within the genus may reflect taxonomic classification.   An accurate assessment of the prevalence and importance of hybridisation requires species classification to be based on genealogical relationships.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eucalypt</field><field name="subject">eucalypts</field><field name="subject">eucalyptus</field><field name="subject">clines</field><field name="subject">clinal variation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030527.124144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Empirical Investigation Between Culture, Investor Protection, International Banking Disclosures and Stock Returns</field><field name="creator">Hooi, George Wye Keong</field><field name="description">There is a renewed interest in further exploring the significance of culture to the accounting disclosure model in view of a highly competitive global business environment. To date, there is no empirical research to investigate this issue with respect to a specific industry, namely banking. There are three main reasons for focusing only on the banking industry (Hooi 2004). First, it is considered to be the most important industry for the country&#146;s economic and financial stability. Moreover, the IASB has recognised its significance by issuing unique accounting standards i.e. IAS30, IAS32 and IAS39. Second, Saidenberg and Schuermann (2003) argue that with the scope and complexity of Basel II, it provides opportunities for researching issues through Pillar 3. Third, with national banking systems being non-homogenous, it is important to investigate the effects of national culture because prior research has argued that cultural differences have partly explained international differences in disclosure framework of accounting systems. The purpose of this study is to apply and extend Gray&#146;s (1988) theoretical framework of national culture with respect to four research questions. First, to contribute to Gray&#146;s (1988) theory of cultural influence on international banking disclosures. Second, to investigate the possible significance of investor protection to the banking disclosure model. Third, to explore Gray&#146;s (1988) theory on the relationship of national culture to capital market research using banking returns. Fourth, to investigate the value relevance of investor protection and banking disclosures to the returns model. Seventeen developed and developing countries with a representative sample of 37 listed domestic commercial banks were examined in 2004. For the disclosure model, the study finds that national culture is a significant factor in the banking industry. Individualism has been found as the primary cultural dimension for banking disclosures. Moreover, the explanatory power of the model significantly improves with the legal dimensions of common law and anti-director rights. The positive association between common law and banking disclosures is consistent with La Porta et al. (1998) which argue that common law countries with stronger investor protection are more transparent than civil law countries. However, there is a negative association between investor protection variable of anti-director rights with banking disclosures. This may suggest that investor protection does not encourage minority investors to enter the stock market specifically in the global banking industry. This situation may lead to a lack of demand for transparency through a smaller dispersion of ownership across the domestic banks. For the returns model, the study finds that national culture is value relevant in the banking industry. Collectivism and power distance have been found to be the two primary cultural dimensions for banking returns. Moreover, the explanatory power of the model significantly improves with anti-director rights and banking disclosures. These results are (1) consistent with La Porta et al. (2002) which argue that investor protection increases firm valuation with respect to Tobin&#146;s Q and (2) international investors tend to support the Basel Committee&#146;s commitment in providing a more transparent framework by implementing Pillar 3 in the near future, starting with the Basel member countries. Finally, an interesting finding from the study is that firm size has a negative association with banking returns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Empirical</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Investor Protection</field><field name="subject">Banking</field><field name="subject">International Banking Disclosures</field><field name="subject">Stock Returns</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071121.133040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Legitimacy and Suitability of the Sabbath as a Symbol of the Eschatological Age</field><field name="creator">Hope, Anne-Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates both the legitimacy and the suitability of the sabbath as a symbol of the eschatological age.  Chapter one introduces the topic and hermeneutic of this thesis.  In particular, it approaches the text in its final form, and with a background of postmodern influence. An overview of the sabbath in Jewish and Christian tradition in chapter two shows that the history of these traditions contains numerous concepts of the sabbath and how it is to be observed.  A similar diversity of opinion is also found among contemporary scholars as to the origin and nature of the sabbath in the Hebrew Scriptures and in ancient Israel. Chapter three compares and contrasts the sabbath with other holy festivals.  While the sabbath shares with these festivals the connection with the number seven, the proscription against work and even the title 'sabbath', it is unique in that it is connected with the attributes of blessedness, rest and holiness, and is presented as a memorial of creation and as a sign of the covenant between God and Israel.  The connection with the concept of 'remembrance' is also confined to the sabbath and to the passover alone. Chapter four makes a more detailed examination of the sabbath passages in the Hebrew Scriptures, paying special attention to the topics of scholarly debate concerning the sabbath that were identified in chapter two.  From these Scriptures, the sabbath may be legitimately interpreted as both a day of rest and a day of worship.  The sabbath is also primarily presented as a Mosaic institution rather than a creation institution, and the Hebrew Scriptures contain no reference to its observance by foreigners outside of Yahweh worship in Israel.  Nor is there any explicit indication that sabbath was a monthly institution, or that it had relatively little prominence during this time.   An examination of the seventh-year festivals and the jubilee supports this understanding of the seventh-day sabbath. The concept of the eschatological age as a state of eternal sabbath also contains within it the implicit concept of holiness as a universal state.  Chapter five investigates the legitimacy of viewing holiness in the Hebrew Scriptures as both perpetual and universal.  While the Hebrew Scriptures contain mixed attitudes to the foreign nations, it does envision them as sharing in Israelite's salvation; and thus anticipates a state of universal holiness.  Using the results of chapters two to five to demonstrate the legitimacy of this thesis' concept of the sabbath, the legitimacy of using this concept of the sabbath as a symbol of the eschatological age is also demonstrated. Drawing heavily on Gowan's work Eschatology in the Old Testament, chapter six identifies the primary themes of the eschatological age to be the end of sin, the presence of God, spiritual transformation, social transformation and the transformation of nature.  It then examines how these themes are also found in connection with the sabbath, and shows that the nature of the sabbath is in many respects similar to the nature of the eschatological age.  This makes the sabbath an especially suitable symbol of this eschatological age. Chapter seven explores what attributes of the sabbath may have made it an especially suitable symbol of the eschatological age in later Jewish and Christian traditions.  In doing so, part one focuses on those unique attributes of the sabbath that were identified in chapter three; holiness, blessedness, rest, remembrance, creation and a covenant symbol.  These attributes are then used to develop the sabbath as a symbol of creation and recreation.  Part two then examines how Christian tradition developed new layers meaning for this symbol. In conclusion, chapter eight notes that the use of one or more of these attributes has been a frequent aspect of interpretations of the sabbath and eschatology.  It is this thesis' presentation of all of these attributes together, however, as well as its identification of the uniqueness of these attributes to the sabbath, which demonstrates so strongly the suitability of the sabbath as a symbol of the eschatological age.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sabbath</field><field name="subject">eschatological age</field><field name="subject">Jewish and Christian tradition</field><field name="subject">holy festtivals</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070314.151801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Female Sexual Health: The Definition and Development of Sexual Subjectivity, and Linkages with Sexual Agency, Sexual Experience and Well-Being in Late Adolescents and Emerging Adults</field><field name="creator">Horne, Sharon</field><field name="description">Sexuality is an integral part of health and well-being. Despite a 30-year history of adolescent sexuality research, there has been little that has focused on more than risky sexual behaviour. For example, there has been little research on conceptions of sexuality and pathways to sexual health. In part, this is because sexual health has been often defined as the lack of risky behaviour and health problems. In the studies reported here, components of female sexual health were identified and tested, including behaviours and cognitions, among groups of girls in their late teens and early 20s. After a review of the literature, four sets of factors appeared central to identifying female sexual health. These factors included sexual subjectivity, sexual agency, psychosocial well-being and sexual exploration. The first factor, sexual subjectivity, had previously been described as important to female sexual well-being, but had been developed within feminist theories and studied with qualitative methodologies. After a thorough review of the literature, no psychometrically sound measure of sexual subjectivity was found. Therefore, an instrument to assess sexual subjectivity was constructed and validated through a series of studies. Partially as expected, five factors were found - sexual body-esteem, entitlement to sexual pleasure from oneself, entitlement to sexual pleasure from a partner, sexual self-efficacy in achieving sexual pleasure, and sexual self-reflection. In additional cross-sectional and longitudinal (6-month, 2 waves) studies, associations between sexual subjectivity, sexual agency, psychosocial well-being, and sexual experience were examined. The results showed that there were concurrent associations between sexual subjectivity and measures of sexual agency and some measures of psychosocial wellbeing. Results also showed that females with more sexual experience (i.e., experience with sexual intercourse, self-masturbation, noncoital orgasmic responsiveness, and same-sex sexual experience) were relatively higher in sexual subjectivity and sexual agency. However, well-being was similar in sexual experience groups when they were compared. In longitudinal analyses, changes in sexual subjectivity, sexual agency and psychosocial well-being were examined for the whole sample and among subgroups defined by levels of sexual experience. Comparisons were also made between those girls who commenced sexual intercourse during the course of the study, those who remained virgins, and those who were nonvirgins at the first assessment. Main effects generally validated cross-sectional findings. Girls who commenced first sexual intercourse relatively earlier increased in self-esteem over time, compared to their virgin counterparts. Girls who reported a history of self-masturbation and noncoital orgasmic responsiveness, and girls who reported no history with either behaviour, increased in sexual body-esteem and self-esteem over time, but the former group of girls were relatively higher in sexual body-esteem and self-esteem than the latter group of girls. Girls who reported a history of one, but not the other of self-masturbation and noncoital orgasm did not change over time. Results also indicated that girls' transition to first sexual intercourse had little association with sexual subjectivity, but some findings were suggestive of a need for further research. Future research, and study strengths and limitations are discussed. There is a need to examine sexual subjectivity as both an antecedent and an outcome using longer time lags with several waves of assessment so that the linkages between sexual subjectivity and other factors can be determined. The implications of sexual subjectivity and sexual exploration for sexuality education are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sexuality</field><field name="subject">adolescent sexuality research</field><field name="subject">sexual subjectivity</field><field name="subject">sexual agency</field><field name="subject">psychosocial well-being</field><field name="subject">sexual exploration</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060726.165349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate Governance in China: An Empirical Study of Listed Firms</field><field name="creator">Hovey, Martin</field><field name="description">Corporate governance has gained considerable prominence in the last decade as it has become a much more widely discussed and debated issue. The debate as to which model of corporate governance China should adopt continues as China forges a new era of interaction with the global market, especially since its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001. The state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector in China is a significant contributing factor in China's endeavour to continue to develop its economy, provide employment and reduce poverty.  Therefore, the success of SOE reform is important to China's future economic prosperity and ability to contend with social justice issues. The commencement of the reform process began in the late 1970s and many SOEs have attained significant progress in some important areas. However, all too many SOEs experience poor overall performance. Thus, the consequence of the corporate governance model and corporate structure selected will be considerable, especially as the country's market economy gains momentum. This thesis contributes to the ongoing body of work relating to corporate governance in China, and some clear results have been found. It also reviews the institutional setting in China and elements of the corporate governance literature in detail. As the ownership of firms is considered to be one of the key elements to enhance corporate governance, the empirical study considers issues relating to changes in ownership, concentration and ownership structures.  It conducts an empirical study of the ownership and performance of listed corporations in China and based on these analyses, the thesis provides policy recommendations as to which model of corporate governance may best be suited to China during this transitional phase. The findings suggest that the ownership structure is a key element to enhancing corporate governance in China. The wealth affects of changes in listed firm ownership, which for the most part had the effect of reducing state ownership, were found to be positive. Concentration ownership structures per se were not found to enhance listed firm performance. The most significant findings were the following. Firstly, that institutional ownership, through the Legal Person holding companies, have a positive bearing on listed firm performance and thus by implication, upon improving corporate governance. Secondly, medium levels of Legal Person ownership were found to be the most effective. Thirdly, foreign institutions and individual investors were found to be positively correlated to performance. Similar results were found for offshore ownership, but to a lessor extent. Conversely, state ownership was found to be negatively correlated to performance. Other issues that were identified in the empirical analysis are that size does matter, in that large firms were found not to perform as well as smaller firms. Leverage appears to matter also, as highly leveraged firms were found not to perform well. The industry in which a firm operates was also found to have an affect on performance. The policy recommendations are based on the findings and observations of this thesis. The assumption is made that the present gradualist approach and regime will continue. As state ownership is shown to have a negative bearing on listed firm performance, the recommendation is that the state, at its various levels, should divest its holdings. This could be achieved through a privatization program in which the state denationalises a large proportion of its holdings. One of the keys would then be managing the change of ownership. Based on the observations and findings of this study, it is recommended that a privatization program should be instigated that supports blockholders and institutions, and does not focus purely on dispersing large proportions of holdings to diverse small shareholders. In addition, mergers and acquisitions that embrace economic efficiency should be encouraged and supported. The empirical study demonstrates that the ultimate ownership and control of tradeable shares ought to be channelled to pension funds, private institutional investors that should be encouraged to take strong stakes in the firms, to strategic investors, especially minority blockholders, and a proportion to international investors. This strategy would be in China's best interests in its present stage of development.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate governance(China)</field><field name="subject">state-owned enterprise sector</field><field name="subject">China's future economic prosperity</field><field name="subject">managing the change of ownership</field><field name="subject">gradualist approach to change</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061018.143503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism Development in Ethnic Areas of Southern China</field><field name="creator">Howard, Paul Jason</field><field name="description">The development of tourism may catalyse a vast array of impacts, social, cultural, socioeconomic, environmental or political.  In ethnic minority communities and regions, impacts are potentially greater due to the pre-existing social, cultural and even sociopolitical constructs. Tourism, as a global phenomenon, is confined to operating within the local context. This is certainly the case in ethnic minority communities of China's southern peripheries. Tourism development is a differential process of formal and informal sector development.  Formal sector development is generally capital intensive and relatively highly organised.  In contrast, the informal sector involves many small vendors and family or community run businesses.  The sectoral dichotomy may also be applied, in a general sense, to the types of tourists utilizing accommodation and services provided by these two distinct sectors.  As the balance between the two sectors changes over time and across space, there is a commensurate shift in the type and scale of impacts generated by tourism in host communities.  It is this that makes the sectoral paradigm so relevant to the role (or indeed lack of role) of ethnic minorities in tourism development in their local areas and communities. Apart from economic impacts, there are sociocultural and even socioenvironmental impacts on host communities.  As with socioeconomic impacts, sociocultural impacts are also influenced by the differential development of the formal and informal sectors over time.  Furthermore, particularly in ethnic minority areas, socioeconomic and sociocultural impacts are tightly integrated and one impact realm cannot adequately be considered in isolation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism (China</field><field name="subject">Southern)</field><field name="subject">tourism development (China</field><field name="subject">Southern)</field><field name="subject">impact of tourism (China</field><field name="subject">Southern)</field><field name="subject">Lijiang (China)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070208.154629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Board Performance of Australian Voluntary Sport Organisations</field><field name="creator">Hoye, Russell</field><field name="description">The governance of Australian nonprofit voluntary sport organisations (VSOs) was once almost the exclusive domain of volunteers. However, changes in government policy and funding levels in recent years has led to the introduction of professional staff in these organisations. Rapid changes to the political, social and economic environment have created new complexities with which VSOs and their governing boards must grapple. Boards act as the main decision making body for these organisations, and as such have a significant impact on the governance of these organisations, and therefore their ability to deliver services. While the process of professionalisation within VSOs has been well documented, very little research has examined factors that may influence the ability of the boards of VSOs to perform effectively. The fields of nonprofit governance and sport management provided a theoretical and conceptual framework for the investigation of the board performance of VSOs. Two broad themes concerning research into board performance were identified in the nonprofit literature; the structural characteristics of the board, and board-executive relations. These two themes have also been addressed to a limited extent within the sport management literature, but not in relation to board performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between board performance, board structures and board-executive relations in Australian VSOs. The study investigated the differences in board structure between effective and ineffective boards, and the relationship between board performance and various elements of board structure, specifically complexity, formalisation and centralisation. The differences in the nature of board-executive relations between effective and ineffective boards, and the relationship of board performance to board-executive relations were also investigated. The sampling frame for the study was state governing bodies of sport in the state of Victoria, Australia. Seven case organisations were identified by a panel of experts; four exhibiting effective board performance and three exhibiting ineffective board performance. Data were collected through structured interviews with executives, from an examination of board documents, from a self-administered questionnaire of executives, board chairs and board members, and through semi-structured interviews with executives, board chairs and board members. Data were collected on board performance, the complexity, formalisation and centralisation of the boards, power patterns within the boards, and the nature of board-executive relations. Data analysis involved both quantitative and qualitative techniques. It was concluded that effective board performance was related to a higher level of board centralisation and associated with a higher level of board formalisation. Board performance was not related to board complexity. Board power patterns that were perceived to be powerless or fragmented were related to lower levels of board performance. Elements of the board-executive relationship that were related to effective board performance were identified as establishing trust between the board and executive, the control of information by the executive, shared board leadership and the responsibility for board performance. Importantly, the study identified the central role executives have in determining the ability of VSO boards to perform effectively. The study contributed to the body of knowledge concerning the governance of VSOs, specifically the measurement of board performance, and the investigation of its relationship with board structure and board-executive relations. A number of questions were advanced for the development of theory and empirical investigation through further research. The study also extended what is known about the models of nonprofit governance and their utility in explaining the workings of VSO boards. The findings of this study suggest that there is a need to adapt such models to the organisational context of member-based organisations such as VSOs.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">board performance</field><field name="subject">voluntary sport organisations</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030304.090329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Australian Mirage</field><field name="creator">Hoyte, Catherine</field><field name="description">This thesis contains a detailed academic analysis of the complete rise and fall of Christopher Skase and his Qintex group mirage.

Completions rose nearly 200 per cent between 1992 and 1994 alone. A series of questions arise in relation to this phenomenon (referred to here as 'the Peak'): Why did it occur? How was this increase in construction achieved in such a short time? What were its impacts? Was it a supply-side or a demand-side phenomenon? And what are the significance and implications of the Peak? This thesis adopts a distinct methodological stance, being explanatory and interpretative rather than concerned with theory construction and testing. It is argued that this is appropriate as the Peak was a singular phenomenon, and not part of the regular fluctuations in a residential market cycle. Consequently, it is treated as an event and event-triggered, rather than as part of a continuing time-series. In addition, given that it was influenced by an enormous array of exogenous factors, including politics, the economy, and government regulations and policy, as well as by demographic, historical and geographical factors, a holistic approach is employed, as opposed to a reductionist one. The purpose is to build as complete an interpretation as possible. A major trigger for the Peak was the announcement of a residential density regulation (vohme control) in early 1992. This regulation, which threatened to dramatically reduce the profitability of development land, caused a massive acceleration in the rate of residential development approvals and ensuing completions. The regulation is viewed as interacting with a loosening of development and construction credit restrictions in late 1990 to precipitate a massive Peak in residential construction. This took glace over a very short period of time. This is analysed for each city and county in Taiwan as well as for Taiwan as a whole, the same factors applying throughout the country with the exception of Taipei City. In Taipei City, the peak occurred in a milder form in the 1980s rather than in the 1990s, due to an earlier implementation of volume control. This provides support for the overall interpretation of the thesis. After its announcement a grace period before the regulation was to come into effect allowed existing developers and landowners to propose and execute land development and construction under the old regulation. This period also induced new developers into the market, in part based on an expectation of higher unit prices resulting from volume control. This created a huge new stock of smaller-size apartments. Accompanied by falling prices, this outcome is consistent with the supply-side explanation of the Peak. Additional evidence of a supply-side phenomenon includes the high vacancies and unsold developer inventories that resulted. The rush to construction under the old regulation meant that the demand and supply market feedback loop could not effectively operate. The presence of simultaneous production peaks in all cities and counties is just one piece of evidence that this feedback loop was ineffective. A pooled cross-sectional time-series model, based on supply and demand factors of all cities and counties during 1982-1998, was used to further analyse this model of the Peak. Again the results are consistent with the supply- side interpretation. While credit loosening and volume control triggered the Peak, it is the existence of huge production flexibilities in the residential construction industry that enabled such a massive and rapid increase in construction. These flexibilities flowed, in part, from a dominant reinforced concrete construction method, as well as the Taiwanese subcontracting system, and residential construction industry networks. It is argued that these networks provided a form of quasi-public good that could be exploited. These same factors also facilitated the rapid entry of new developers into the industry. Conversely, this was associated with a decline in construction quality, as the limits of flexibility were reached. Some evidence for this was revealed by the 1999 earthquake. Imputed construction costs rose enormously during the Peak, with profits necessarily declining under the combined pressures of falling prices and rising costs. This resulted in bankruptcies and other exits from the industry. The impacts of oversupply -such as a high vacancy rate, growing developer inventories and falling prices -are expected to be long-term. The vacant stock is calculated as equivalent to ten to twelve years of pre- Peak construction. This thesis concludes that the Peak was a discontinuity phenomenon. It was triggered by a unique set of events, rather than being part of a continuous historical development. While developer behaviour was individually rational, collectively their decisions were disastrous for themselves and the industry</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taiwanese residential construction</field><field name="subject">construction industry</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">residential density regulation</field><field name="subject">1999 earthquake</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051107.122656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public Health Nutrition Workforce Development: An Intelligence-Based Blueprint for Australia</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Roger</field><field name="description">Public health nutrition workforce development is a capacity building strategy identified as a priority in the Australian National Public Health Nutrition Strategy (Eat Well Australia). Systematic and scholarly approaches to workforce development that enhance the capacity of the health system and the broader community to effectively address public health nutrition issues, are limited in Australia. The associated lack of intelligence and a range of methodological difficulties similar to those encountered in broader public health workforce research, provide the need for, and motivation for, this study. The specific objectives of this study relate to the development of workforce development intelligence that: Fills gaps in the knowledge base to inform effective workforce development ; Provides baseline data (benchmarks) for ongoing workforce development planning, evaluation, monitoring and surveillance ; and, Contributes to international scholarship regarding public health nutrition workforce development ; and, Enables the development of a strategic framework for workforce development planning in the national context. The case study research strategy used in this study involved an emergent, multi-method design involving methodological triangulation of data and consensus development. The focus of inquiry was based on a problem-based conceptual framework developed to identify intelligence needs for workforce development strategy planning.  Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using five different methods including literature review, interviews with advanced-level public health nutritionists in Australia, a national public health nutrition workforce survey, an analysis of position descriptions and consensus assessment and development via a Delphi survey of an international expert panel. The collection, analysis and interpretation of data in this study focused on developing an intelligence base on six main issues pertinent to public health nutrition workforce development, including: Definitions of public health nutrition; Workforce size and composition; Workforce practices; Core workforce functions needed; Competencies required for effective public health nutrition practice; and, Continuing competency development needs. Data from these multiple methods were used to describe and interpret the determinants of workforce capacity, assisted by triangular analysis. This analysis identified a range of determinants limiting the capacity of the Australian public health nutrition workforce including; A small designated specialist public health nutrition workforce; Workforce instability associated with unsecured funding and staff turnover; Limited collaboration and partnership building practices by the existing workforce; Disorganisation of the workforce in terms of location, accountability, service mandates and support; Workforce practices are not consistent with the required work; Limited access to, and use of, public health nutrition intelligence; A workforce practice culture that does not promote research and dissemination; A lack of practice improvement and learning systems; Limited access to public health nutrition mentors; Limited incentives for practice excellence; An absence of consensus about the required work and competencies required for effective public health nutrition practice; Barriers to continuing competency development; and, Inadequate workforce preparation.   This interpretive analysis provided the basis for developing a strategic framework that addresses workforce quantity, quality and performance concerns, based on workforce development strategy categories including: Building human resource infrastructure (quantity); Organisational systems and policy (performance); Intelligence support (performance); Learning systems (quality) and; Workforce preparation. This research has also provided data that can for the basis of tools such as definitions, core function statements, position descriptions and competency standards to assist public health nutrition workforce development in Australia and internationally.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">nutrition policy</field><field name="subject">workforce development</field><field name="subject">public health workers</field><field name="subject">competency</field><field name="subject">competencies</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040615.120233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Affective Empathy in Children: Measurement and Correlates</field><field name="creator">Hunter, Kirsten</field><field name="description">Empathy is a construct that plays a pivotal role in the development of interpersonal relationships, and thus ones ability to function socially and often professionally. The development of empathy in children is therefore of particular interest to allow for further understanding of normative and atypical developmental trajectories. This thesis investigated the assessment of affective empathy in children aged 5-12, through the development and comparison of a multimethod assessment approach. Furthermore this thesis evaluated the differential relationships between affective empathy and global behavioural problems in children versus the presence of early psychopathic traits, such as callous-unemotional traits. The first component of this study incorporated; a measure of facial expression of affective empathy, and self-reported experience of affective empathy, as measured by the newly designed Griffith Empathy Measure - Video Observation (GEM-VO) and the Griffith Empathy Measure - Self Report (GEM-SR); the Bryant's Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents (1982) which is a traditional child self-report measure; and a newly designed parent-report of child affective empathy (Griffith Empathy Measure - Parent Report; GEM-PR). Using a normative community sample of 211 children from grades 1, 3, 5, and 7 (aged 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, &amp; 11-12, respectively), the GEM-PR and the Bryant were found to have moderate to strong internal consistency. As a measure of concurrent validity, strong positive correlations were found between the mother and father reports (GEM-PR) of their child's affective empathy, for grades 5 and 7, and for girls of all age groups. Using a convenience sample of 31 parents and children aged 5 to 12, the GEM-PR and the Bryant demonstrated strong test-retest reliability. The reliability of the GEM-VO and the GEM-SR were assessed using a convenience sample of 20 children aged 5 to 12. These measures involve the assessment of children's facial and verbal responses to emotionally evocative videotape vignettes. Children were unobtrusively videotaped while they watched the vignettes and their facial expressions were coded. Children were then interviewed to determine the emotions they attributed to stimulus persons and to themselves whilst viewing the material. Adequate to strong test-retest reliability was found for both measures. Using 30% from the larger sample of 211 participants (N=60), the GEM-VO also demonstrated robust inter-rater reliability.  This multimethod approach to assessing child affective empathy produced differing age and gender trends. Facial affect as reported by the GEM-VO decreased with age. Similarly, the matching of child facial emotion to the vignette protagonist's facial emotion was higher in the younger grades. These findings suggest that measures that assess the matching of facial affect (i.e., GEM-VO) may be more appropriate for younger age groups who have not yet learnt to conceal their facial expression of emotion. Data from the GEM-SR suggests that older children are more verbally expressive of negative emotions then younger children, with older girls found to be the most verbally expressive of feeling the same emotion as the vignette character; a role more complimentary of the female gender socialization pressures. These findings are also indicative of the increase in emotional vocabulary and self-awareness in older children, supporting the validity of child self-report measures (based on observational stimuli) with older children.  In comparing data from the GEM-VO and GEM-SR, this study found that for negative emotions the consistency between facial emotions coded and emotions verbally reported increased with age. This consistency across gender and amongst the older age groups provides encouraging concurrent validity, suggesting the results of one measure could be inferred through the exclusive use of the alternate measurement approach. In contrast, affective empathy as measured by the two measures; the accurate matching of the participant and vignette character's facial expression (GEM-VO), and the accurate matching of the self reported and vignette character's emotion (GEM-SR); were not found to converge. This finding is consistent with prior research and questions the assumption that facially expressed and self-appraised indexes of affective empathy are different aspects of a complex unified process.   When evaluating the convergence of all four measures of affective empathy, negative correlations were found between the Bryant and the GEM-PR, these two measures were also found to not converge with the GEM-VO and GEM-SR in a consistent and predictable way. These findings pose the question of whether different aspects of the complex phenomena of affective empathy are being assessed. Furthermore, the validity of the exclusive use of a child self report measure such as the Bryant, which is the standard assessment in the literature, is questioned. The possibility that callous-unemotional traits (CU; a unique subgroup identified in the child psychopathy literature) may account for the mixed findings throughout research regarding the assumption that deficiencies in empathy underlie conduct problems in children, was examined using regression analysis.  Using the previous sample of 211 children aged 5-12, conduct problems (CP) were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1999), and the CU subscale was used from the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD; Caputo, Frick, &amp; Brodsky, 1999). Affective empathy when measured by the GEM-PR and the Bryant showed differing patterns in the relationship between affective empathy, CU traits and CP. While the GEM-Father reported that neither age, CU traits nor CP accounted for affective empathy variance, the GEM-Mother report supported that affective empathy was no longer associated with CP once CU traits had been partialled out. In contrast, the Bryant reported for girls, that CU traits were not found to have an underlying correlational relationship. It can be argued from the GEM-Mother data only that it was the unmeasured variance of CU traits that was accounting for the relationship between CP and affective empathy found in the literature. Furthermore, the comparison of an altered CU subscale with all possible empathy items removed, suggests that the constructs of CU traits and affective empathy are not synonymous or overlapping in nature, but rather are two independent constructs.  This multimethod approach highlights the complexity of this research area, exemplifying the significant influence of the source of the reports, and suggesting that affective empathy consists of multiple components that are assessed to differing degrees by the different measurement approaches.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">affective empathy</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">child psychology</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">behavioural disorders</field><field name="subject">behavioral disorders</field><field name="subject">face</field><field name="subject">facial expression</field><field name="subject">expression</field><field name="subject">conduct</field><field name="subject">callous-unemotional traits</field><field name="subject">emotion</field><field name="subject">emotions</field><field name="subject">emotional</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040610.135822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Longitudinal Path Model of Children's Depression and Externalising Problems as Outcomes of Behaviours, Peer Rejection, and Peer-Related Attributions and Perceptions</field><field name="creator">Hunter, Tracey A</field><field name="description">A model of social behaviours, peer rejection, social cognitions and psychosocial outcomes in children aged 9 to 12 was investigated. Two studies, including one pilot study (Study 1) and a longitudinal study with two waves and a 6-month lag between assessments (Study 2A and Study 2B), were conducted to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships pertaining to the antecedents and consequences of peer rejection as children approach adolescence. In Study 1, perceptions of relationships, peer-related attributions, and depressive symptoms were examined as consequences of peer rejection among 208 Grade 5 and 6 children aged 9 to 11 from one primary school. The findings from this study indicated that social cognitions play a partial mediating role linking peer rejection to depressive symptoms. The interaction between peer rejection and social cognitions did not contribute to the prediction of depressive symptoms, therefore a diathesis-stress model of depression was not supported. Study 2A and 2B were cross-sectional and longitudinal examinations of Study 1. A model of social behaviours, peer rejection, social cognitions and children's functioning was proposed and tested. In these studies, perceptions of relationships and perceived social acceptance were indicators of social cognitions. Participants were 334 Grade 5 to 7 children mostly aged 9 to 12, with 308 participants completing both assessments of the longitudinal study. Results of Study 2A provided further support for the mediating role of social cognitions between peer rejection and depressive symptoms. Positive associations between peer rejection, relational aggression and withdrawal, and a negative association between peer rejection and prosocial behaviour were also found. Significant associations of externalising behaviour with physical aggression and peer rejection were also found, suggesting separate pathways to depression and externalising behaviour via children's behaviours and peer rejection. In the longitudinal study, earlier relational aggression and withdrawal were associated with later peer rejection. No support for a longitudinal mediation effect for social cognitions in the peer rejection-depression relationship was observed, although a bidirectional association between social cognitions and depressive symptoms over time was found. Gender differences and moderation were also tested, but few effects were found. It was concluded that children's cognitions regarding peer relationships and perceived social acceptance are important factors in understanding the pathways from peer difficulties to depression during late childhood. Furthermore, evidence was found for specific pathways linking children's social behaviours to depression and externalising behaviour. Implications for theory, research and practice are discussed, including the importance of considering the child's perceptions of their peer functioning as well as actual peer status, and the need for future research to examine social cognitive factors relevant to aggression as well as withdrawal. Possible directions for targeted interventions are also described.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Depression in children</field><field name="subject">peer rejection</field><field name="subject">peer-related attributions</field><field name="subject">peer-related perceptions</field><field name="subject">problem behaviours</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060309.114836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards the 'Smart State': The Teaching and Learning of Thinking Skills</field><field name="creator">Hurley, Gabrielle C.</field><field name="description">In an age of substantial educational reform, the teaching and learning of 'thinking-skills' are considered to be an integral component of a child's education. Further, they are considered an important factor in developing skills which may contribute to increased learning outcomes for all learners. Current reform agenda nominate a range of 'thinking-skills' and processes that inform essential lifelong learnings and that are supported by characteristics that all learners should exhibit. At the heart of such prescription is a vision of a future in which 'process' rather than 'knowledge' will be the focus. A fundamental paradigm shift is pressing, and so too, the revised role of the teacher. Teacher practices that assist students to search for their own understandings rather than follow other people's logic are paramount and essential to the successful implementation of educational change.  This case study presents one teacher's approach to the provision of 'thinking-skills' instruction in a primary school classroom for year-six children. The three objectives of the project were first, to trial a different pedagogical approach, second, to influence and change the 'thinking' habits of youngsters, and third, to encourage students to employ 'good thinking' in order to maximize learning outcomes. The model for implementation was underpinned by philosophical approaches gleaned from the literature, which were caring, humane, stimulating and creative. An eclectic mix of insights and strategies were  employed to target full immersion of students and teacher into a 'Thinking-Skills Classroom'.  Data were gathered from two groups of student participants who represented two discrete learning contexts. One context was that of the Trial Classroom, where the 'immersion' process sought to create a 'culture of thinking', in which 'thinking' was the focus of all teaching, learning, and operating activity. The context of the Control Classroom, was one in which 'thinking' was not the focus of all instruction and learning, but rather, was taught in an incidental and less formal manner. The aim of this study was to determine whether significant educational outcomes would become apparent in the Trial Classroom, that is in a context where children were immersed in, and learned to use, a range of strategies aimed at progressing them as independent, confident and 'accomplished thinkers'. The teaching experiment that was 'The Thinking-Skills Classroom', proved successful. The research has revealed effective 'transfer' after instruction for students in the Trial Classroom. Learners effectively applied new 'thinking understandings' into everyday thinking situations, in addressing real-life problem solving, and in producing evidence of new ways of operating.  Across all strata of academic ability students from the Trial Classroom increased their thinking prowess. A category was established for 'excellent thinkers', where students demonstrated acquisition of a different set of skills from those normally associated with 'good thinking'. Students developed increased self-confidence, risk-taking initiatives and independence across the board as a result of increased thinking ability.  A study of this kind may be helpful to other teacher/researchers who are considering instructional and curriculum change in light of wider paradigmatic change in education. Although this particular study would be difficult to replicate, this researcher's story can be usefully interpreted to allow insights and generalizations from the case-study to be made. These may serve as a catalyst for other innovative school-based pedagogies to emerge, and for new learning approaches to be considered and trialled, in order to prepare students for life and learning in the Twenty-First Century.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">thinking</field><field name="subject">thinking skills</field><field name="subject">critical thinking</field><field name="subject">thought</field><field name="subject">immersion</field><field name="subject">problem solving</field><field name="subject">primary school</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040220.150536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Functional Role of NRAP in the Nucleolus</field><field name="creator">Inder, Kerry</field><field name="description">The nucleolus is the site for rRNA synthesis, a process requiring the recruitment of many proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis. Nrap is a novel nucleolar protein found to be present in all eukaryotes. Preliminary characterisation of Nrap suggested it was likely to participate in ribosome biogenesis but as with many other nucleolar proteins, the functional role of Nrap is largely unknown. In this study, the role of mammalian Nrap in the nucleolus and in ribosome biogenesis was explored. Initially, a number of tools were generated to investigate Nrap function. This involved raising and purifying a polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal region of Nrap. The anti-Nrap antibody was found to detect two Nrap bands in mouse fibroblast cells, possibly corresponding to the two mouse Nrap isoforms,   and  . In addition, mammalian expression vectors containing the full Nrap sequence as well as deletion constructs were created. The subcellular localisation of each construct was observed by fluorescent microscopy. It was revealed that recombinant Nrap did not localise to the nucleolus, possibly because it was exported to undergo degradation by the 26S proteasome. Two putative NLSs were found to be responsible for directing Nrap to the nucleus but a region accountable for nucleolar localisation was not identified. The data indicated that multiple domains working together are likely to direct Nrap to the nucleolus. Nrap was also observed to co-localise with nucleolar proteins B23 and p19ARF. Moreover, it was shown by reciprocal immunoprecipitation that these three nucleolar proteins existed in a complex in unsynchronised mouse fibroblast cells. Recent reports demonstrated a complex relationship between B23 and p19ARF although the functional significance remained unclear. Nrap's in vivo association with B23 and p19ARF indicated a specific functional role in the nucleolus. Nrap knockdown using siRNA significantly increased B23 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner and down-regulated p19ARF protein levels at higher siRNA concentration. Preliminary studies also implicated Nrap in cell proliferation through these novel interactions. Both endogenous and recombinant Nrap were found to be highly unstable suggesting that Nrap might regulate B23 and p19ARF through its own tightly regulated stability. Finally, the role of Nrap in rRNA processing was investigated by northern blot analysis. Nrap knockdown was found to affect the levels of 45S, 32S and 28S rRNAs. The changes found may be a consequence of the concurrent perturbation in the levels of B23 and p19ARF caused by Nrap knockdown. As the results were not consistent with previous reports, it was likely that changes to rRNA processing could be contributed to Nrap loss of function. This study demonstrated for the first time a functional role of Nrap in rRNA processing possibly through its association with B23 and p19ARF.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NRAP</field><field name="subject">novel nucleolar protein</field><field name="subject">nucleolus</field><field name="subject">eukaryotes</field><field name="subject">ribosomal biogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070201.133347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Realization of Dielectric Embedded Monopole Radiating Structures For Wireless Computing</field><field name="creator">Ireland, David John</field><field name="description">With the rapid of growth of wireless connectivity more demand is placed on the need for innovative technologies capable of satisfying increasing user demand and network capacity. Adaptive antennas systems or most commonly known as Smart Antennas are expected to be implemented in the next generation of wireless systems. Their implementation avails in dynamic adaptation to spatial and temporal conditions affecting the quality of communication, while offering tremendous flexibility to wireless providers. However one of the major challenges facing Smart Antenna technology is the inherent complexity of the antenna structure, associated control algorithm and implemented RF components possibly contributing to the delay of commercial interest. This thesis will present various adaptive antenna configurations that utilize an embedded dielectric in order to achieve significant size reduction and mechanical rigidity while maintaining favorable electromagnetic performance. In order to constrict the lateral ground plane dimension, a cylindrical shaped hollow ground skirt was attached to the antenna structures effectively compromising between effective beam forming in the azimuth plane and physical size.   The complexity of these antenna structures requires a more contemporary design approach which involved computer modeling using a commercial available Finite Element software package and optimization using a developed generic Genetic Algorithm based optimization program.  A dielectric embedded 7-element monopole array antenna featuring switched parasitic elements is presented and optimized for maximum vertically polarized gain in the horizontal plane,  producing an antenna structure with a radial length of less then 0.25&#955;  and total height of 0.4&amp;alamba which was shown to radiate a main lobe beamwidth of 80 degrees with an absolute gain of 4.8dBi at 2.45GHz. Further on a dielectric embedded 7-element monopole array antenna featuring parasitic elements terminated with finite set of terminating reactive loads is presented with a radial length of less then 0.25&amp;alambda and total height of 0.4&amp;alambda.  The antenna structure and reactive load combination were optimized for maximum horizontal gain producing a principal main lobe with a measured gain of 5.1dBi and beamwidth of 110 degrees at 2.48GHz. Finally it was shown single and dual radiation lobes maybe produced when active monopoles elements are placed eccentric in a circular shaped dielectric material. A circular array of elements embedded in a dielectric material was realized with measured gains of single and dual beam radiation at 2.45GHz was shown to be 5.18dBi and 3.65Bi respectively with corresponding beamwidths of 78.5 degrees and 53 degrees.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless computing</field><field name="subject">dielectric embedded monopole radiating structures</field><field name="subject">adaptive antennas</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070117.175717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Murky Waters? Science, Politics and Environmental Decision-Making in the Brisbane River Dredging Dispute</field><field name="creator">Jakku, Emma</field><field name="description">Environmental sociology and the sociology of scientific knowledge provide a strong theoretical foundation for investigating the role of science in environmental disputes.  The field of environmental dispute resolution has built a body of literature, outlining the techniques and practices that underpin the successful resolution of disputes, over controversial environmental issues.  However, the literature on dispute resolution has generally neglected the role of science in environmental disputes.  This thesis develops a theoretical framework based on concepts from environmental sociology and the sociology of scientific knowledge in order to critically examine the role of science in environmental disputes.  In particular, this thesis combines the theory on claims-making from environmental sociology with actor-network theory and the theory on boundary-work from the sociology of scientific knowledge, to analyse the way in which science was involved in the dispute over phasing out extractive dredging from the Brisbane River.  Data were collected from qualitative in-depth interviews with key players in the Brisbane River dredging dispute and combined with analysis of relevant documents and newspaper articles.  Each of the components of the theoretical framework developed in this thesis contributes to an in-depth analysis of the way in which science was involved in the dredging dispute. The environmental claims-making analysis examines the way in which the claim that extractive dredging was an environmental problem for the Brisbane River was constructed and contested.  The actor-network analysis compares the two competing actor-networks that were developed by one of the major concrete companies and by the anti-dredging campaigners.  The boundary-work analysis examines the social construction of the science / politics border as an important site of boundary-work, before exploring other related forms of boundary-work within the case study.  When combined, these theories highlight the social and political processes that underpin the inherent difficulties associated with applying science to effective environmental dispute resolution.   The theoretical framework developed in this thesis highlights the way in which an analysis of environmental claims-making, actor-networks and boundary-work, extends the literature on environmental dispute resolution. This thesis therefore makes a significant contribution to the field of environmental dispute resolution, by illustrating the advantages of drawing on theoretical perspectives from environmental sociology and the sociology of scientific knowledge.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brisbane</field><field name="subject">Brisbane River</field><field name="subject">dredging</field><field name="subject">dredges</field><field name="subject">environmental policy</field><field name="subject">environmental sociology</field><field name="subject">environmental disputes</field><field name="subject">dispute resolution</field><field name="subject">environmental dispute resolution</field><field name="subject">decisions</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">scientific knowledge</field><field name="subject">actor-network theory</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040810.131650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Couples Coping With End-Stage Cancer: The Influence of Attachment, Emotional Support, and Positive Meaning on Psychological Adjustment and Each Other</field><field name="creator">Jenick, Marcus</field><field name="description">This thesis was concerned with the psychological adjustment of 67 end-stage cancer patients, and three psychosocial variables considered to influence that adjustment: emotional support from spouse, positive meaning, and working models of attachment. Furthermore, this thesis was also concerned with the psychological adjustment of the patients' spouses, and the influence of emotional support from patient and working models of attachment on their adjustment. It was hypothesised that each of these psychosocial variables would directly influence the psychological adjustment of patients and spouses, measured using the negative affectivity scale of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). Furthermore, it was hypothesised that emotional support would influence positive meaning, and working models of attachment would influence both emotional support and positive meaning. Variables were measured via paper and pencil self-report inventories, with the exception of positive meaning, where verbal responses to an open question were coded. Univariate analyses indicated an association between patients' and spouses' emotional support provided by one another and their psychological adjustment. Univariate results also showed that patients' positive meaning was related to patients' psychological adjustment, and that patients' working models of attachment involving higher levels of attachment anxiety were associated with patients' poorer psychological adjustment. All these individual associations remained statistically significant after three control variables related to the patients' physical condition were taken into account. In addition, univariate analyses indicated that attachment was associated with emotional support, and that emotional support was associated with positive meaning. Following univariate analyses, variables were integrated into one model for patients and another for spouses using path analyses. Results were generally consistent with the prior sets of analyses. However, patients' working models of attachment involving higher levels of attachment anxiety no longer had a direct effect on patients' psychological adjustment to statistically significant levels. Rather, the influence of the working models of attachment on patients' psychological adjustment was mediated by emotional support. In addition, patients' positive meaning no longer had a significant direct effect on patients' psychological adjustment. The insignificant path coefficients between attachment anxiety and psychological adjustment, and between positive meaning and psychological adjustment, were attributed to the large amount of variance in negative affect due to emotional support. In summary, this research indicates that emotional support given and received between patients and spouses is important to the psychological adjustment of each party. Furthermore, emotional support influences patients' ability to construe positive meaning in their illness, although positive meaning does not appear to be as critical to the psychological adjustment of patients as emotional support. Working models of attachment influence the psychological adjustment of patients primarily through their influence on emotional support.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer patients</field><field name="subject">spouses of cancer patients</field><field name="subject">partners of cancer patients</field><field name="subject">adjustment</field><field name="subject">attachment</field><field name="subject">emotional support</field><field name="subject">terminally ill</field><field name="subject">Positive and Negative Affect Scale</field><field name="subject">PANAS</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030804.121524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of Principal Appraisal: Experience in Australian Lutheran Schools</field><field name="creator">Jericho, Adrienne John</field><field name="description">This study was an investigation into participant perceptions of principal appraisal in Australian Lutheran schools where a national, systematic appraisal process for principals, entitled Principal Appraisal for Development (PAD), has been in place since 2000.  The study group for the investigation consisted of fifteen principals, ten chairpersons of school councils and two district directors, all of whom had been involved in the process.  The literature review indicated that whilst there was substantive scholarly writing on the purpose and methods of principal appraisal, there was a lack of recorded research on the experience and longer term outcomes of appraisal.  Accordingly, the focus of the study was an examination of participant perceptions of the experience and impact of appraisal.  The study's theoretical underpinning was symbolic interactionism and it adopted a qualitative approach to answer the central research question:  What are principal and governing council chairperson perceptions of the efficacy of principal appraisal processes in Australian Lutheran schools?  Data for the study were gathered through focus group and individual qualitative interviews.  In addition, documents associated with the appraisal process were obtained for analysis.  The data were then analysed using grounded theory methods, leading to the generation of three theoretical propositions.  The first proposition was that the efficacy of principal appraisal depended on the completion of an explicit process that followed six clearly defined and understood steps; the second: that five perceptions of the efficacy of the appraisal process could be identified amongst participants; and the third: that the role played by key players in a spirit of trust in the process and in one another facilitated perceptions of efficacy in the appraisal process.  Furthermore, the context in which the process took place, the actual purpose of the process and the nature of responses by participants emerged as key factors in each proposition.  In particular, these factors determined whether the appraisal process advanced through the six defined stages required to ensure meaningful, long-term development for the principal, which of the perceptions of efficacy of the process for development was held by participants, and the extent to which trust in one another and in the process was evident. From these propositions eight statements that describe the experience of study participants were identified.  These comprised: their belief that a development purpose must have priority in appraisal for perceptions of efficacy of the process; credible messages needed to emerge from the appraisal process for perceptions of its efficacy; appraisal needed to be perceived as a complex process of change involving meaning-making; principal as agent and initiator in the appraisal process facilitated perceptions of efficacy; a supportive and improvement-oriented environment for professional development was associated with perceptions of efficacy of the process; professional development of the principal needed to be perceived as a complex process; trust in the process and in one another was necessary for perceptions of appraisal's efficacy; and appraisal was recognised as having outcomes that may distract from development.  These findings have specific implications for the policy and practice of principal appraisal in Lutheran schools, especially as PAD is reviewed.  The findings also have application to other appraisal settings and generated key questions to assist in developing, implementing and evaluating principal appraisal systems.  The study also indicated that those involved in the appraisal process need to think through how appraisal, development and accountability are related.  These concepts are important and legitimate, and are to be both separated and recognised in any employment context.  The study found that appraisal that resulted in development was a complex process of change involving shifts to meaning and behaviour.  Such a process needed to be supported through an environment of trust with an improvement focus.  The study has indicated that appraisal for development needs to be informed more fully by an understanding of the professional development literature.  In summary, the study has contributed to an understanding of the place of appraisal in the learning and development of school principals.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school principals</field><field name="subject">principal</field><field name="subject">appraisal</field><field name="subject">appraisals</field><field name="subject">appraisal systems</field><field name="subject">Lutheran schools</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">career development</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040919.113840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of Photocatalytic Processes at Nanoporous TiO2 Film Electrodes by Photoelectrochemical Techniques and Development of a Novel Methodology for Rapid Determination of Chemical Oxygen Demand</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Dianlu</field><field name="description">In this work, a series of simple, rapid and effective photoelectrochemical methodologies have been developed and successfully applied to the study of kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of photocatalytic oxidation processes at TiO2 nanoparticulate films.  As an application of the systematic studies of photocatalytic processes by photoelectrochemical techniques, a rapid, direct, absolute, environmental-friendly and accurate COD analysis method was successfully developed. In this work, the TiO2 nanoparticles colloid was prepared by the sol-gel method.  The TiO2 nanoparticles were immobilized onto ITO conducting glass slides by dip-coating method.  Thermal treatment was carried out to obtain nanoporous TiO2 films of different structures.  At low calcination temperature (below 600&#176;C), nanoporous TiO2 films of pure anatase phase were prepared.  At high calcination temperature (above 600&#176;C), nanoporous TiO2 films of mixed anatase and rutile phases were obtained.  At these film electrodes, the work was carried out. By employing steady state photocurrent method and choosing phthalic acid as the model compound, the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanoporous films calcined at various temperatures and for different lengths of time was evaluated.  It was found that the films with mixed anatase and rutile phases calcined at high temperature exhibited high photocatalytic activity.  Based on semiconductor band theory, a model was proposed, which explained well this finding.  By employing linear sweep voltammetry (under illumination) and choosing glucose (an effective photohole scavenger) as a model compound, the characteristics of the photocatalytic processes at nanoparticulate semiconductor electrodes were investigated.  Characteristics of the nanoporous semiconductor electrodes markedly different from bulk semiconductor electrodes were observed.  That is, within a large range of electrode potentials above the flat band potential the electrodes behaved as a pure resistance instead of exhibiting variable resistance expected for bulk semiconductor electrodes.  The magnitude of the resistance was dependent on the properties of the electrodes and the maximum photocatalytic oxidation rate at TiO2 surface determined by the light intensity and substrate concentration.  A model was proposed, which explained well the special characteristics of particulate semiconductor electrodes (nanoporous semiconductor electrodes).  This is the first clear description of the overall photocatalytic process at nanoparticulate semiconductor electrodes.  The investigation set a theoretical foundation for employing photoelectrochemical techniques to study photocatalytic processes. By using the transient technique (illumination step method analogous to potential step method in conventional electrochemistry), the adsorption of a number of strong adsorbates on both low temperature and high temperature calcined TiO2 nanoporous films was investigated.  Similar adsorption characteristics for different adsorbates on different films were observed.  In all the cases, three different surface bound complexes were identified, which was attributed to the heterogeneity of TiO2 surface.  The photocatalytic degradation kinetics of the pre-adsorbed organic compounds of different chemical nature was also studied by processing the photocurrent-time profiles.  Two different photocatalytic processes, exhibiting different rate characteristics, were observed.  This was, again, attributed to the heterogeneity of the TiO2 surface corresponding to heterogeneous adsorption characteristics.  The catalytic first order rate constants of both fast and slow processes were obtained for different organic compounds.  It was found that for different adsorbates of different chemical nature the magnitudes of rate constant for the slow kinetic process were very similar, while the magnitudes of rate constant for the fast process were significantly affected by the photohole demand characteristics of different adsorbates.  Photohole demand distribution that depends on the size and structure of the adsorbed molecules was believed to be responsible for the difference.   By employing steady state photocurrent method, the photocatalytic degradation kinetic characteristics of both strong adsorbates and weak adsorbates of different chemical structures were compared at pure anatase TiO2 nanoporous TiO2 films as well as at anatase/rutile mixed phase TiO2 nanoporous film electrodes.  At the former electrodes for all the different organic compounds studied, the photocatalytic reaction rate increased linearly with concentration at low concentrations.  Under such conditions, it was demonstrated that the overall photocatalytic process was controlled by diffusion and was independent of the chemical nature of organic compounds.  However, the linear concentration range and the maximum photocatalytic reaction rate at high concentrations were significantly dependent on the chemical nature of the substrates.  This was explained by the difference in the interaction of different organic compounds with TiO2 surface, the difference in their photohole demand distributions at the TiO2 surface and the difference in their nature of intermediates formed during their photocatalytic mineralization.  In contrast, at the latter electrodes for the photocatalytic oxidation of different organic compounds the linear ranges (diffusion control concentration range) and the maximum reaction rates at high concentration were much larger than at the former electrodes and much less dependent on the chemical nature of the organic compounds.  The spatial separation of photoelectrons and photoholes (due to the coexistence of rutile phase and anatase phase) and the increase in the lifetime of photoelectrons and photoholes are responsible for the excellent photocatalytic activity of the electrodes. By employing the thin-layer photoelectrochemical technique (analogous to the thin-layer exhaustive electrolytic technique), the photocatalytic oxidation of different organic compounds at the mixed phase TiO2 nanoporous electrodes were investigated in a thin layer photoelectrochemical cell.  It was found that the charge derived from exhaustive oxidation agreed well with theoretical charge expected for the mineralisation of a specific organic compound.  This finding was true for all the compounds investigated and was also true for mixtures of different organic compounds.  The photocatalytic degradation kinetics of different organic compounds of different chemical identities in the thin layer cell was also investigated by the photoelectrochemical method.  Two kinetic processes of different decay time constants were identified, which were attributed to the degradation of preadsorbed compounds and the degradation of compounds in solution.  For the degradation of compounds in solution, a change in the overall control step from substrate diffusion to heterogeneous surface reaction was observed.  For different organic compounds, the variation of the rate constant was determined by the photohole demand rather than by the chemical identities of substrates.  The kinetics of the fast kinetic process, on the other hand, was greatly affected by the adsorption properties of the substrates.  For the strong adsorbates, the rate was much larger than for weak adsorbates.  However, the rate constant of the process was independent of the chemical identities of the substrates and the variation of the constant was also determined by the photohole demand. Based on the principles of exhaustive photoelectrocatalytic degradation of organic matter in a thin layer cell, a novel, rapid, direct, environmental-friendly and absolute COD analysis method was developed.  The method was tested on synthetic samples as well as real wastewater samples from a variety of industries.  For synthetic samples with given compositions the COD values measured by my method agree very well with theoretical COD value.  For real samples and synthetic samples the COD values measured by my method correlated very well with those measured by standard dichromate COD analysis method.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">photocatalytic oxidation process</field><field name="subject">processes</field><field name="subject">electrode</field><field name="subject">electrodes</field><field name="subject">TiO2</field><field name="subject">titanium oxide</field><field name="subject">semiconductor</field><field name="subject">semiconductors</field><field name="subject">film</field><field name="subject">films</field><field name="subject">thin films</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040723.155003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating Ad Hoc Electronic Product Catalogues Through Collaborative Maintenance of Semantic Consistency</field><field name="creator">Jingzhi, Guo</field><field name="description">Existing electronic markets are fragmented in the sense that each is an information island. The interoperation of product information between them is difficult especially in semantics communication. This prevents the formation of global electronic markets and the lowering distribution cost through market globalisation. The traditional and contemporary ap-proaches of product standardisation and ontology mediation could solve the problem only if all markets could adopt the same product standards, or mediation systems could mediate all heterogeneous standards and markets without semantic conflicts. However, problems generally exist in adopting a universal standard or mediating all markets through existing mediation systems. A reflection of the issue is that there are millions of ad hoc electronic product catalogues (EPCs) situated in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), where each EPC is a semantic community, often not aware of standards and mediation systems due to its ad hoc nature. This thesis focuses on the semantic integration of autonomous ad hoc EPCs, which are semantically inconsistent with each other. Firstly, a novel Collaborative Concept Exchange (CONEX) approach is developed for the se-mantic integration of ad hoc EPCs. Using this approach, a PRODUCT MAP is first built based on the theories of semiotic analysis and market segmentation. It functions as an analytical framework to articulate ad hoc EPCs, and answers the questions: what are the general char-acteristics of ad hoc EPCs, what are their heterogeneous relations, and how they are unevenly distributed in fragmented electronic markets. Within this framework, an abstract representa-tion of ad hoc EPCs is proposed using the articulated elements that are simple and manipu-lable. Major contributions of this framework include: the models of the abstract representa-tion of ad hoc EPCs on their structures, concepts and contexts; the semantic integration conditions of heterogeneous ad hoc EPCs; and a ConexNet of market network topology that captures the characteristics of ad hoc EPCs that are unevenly distributed in fragmented elec-tronic markets. Secondly, a three-layer CONEX information model is proposed to integrate ad hoc EPCs based on the PRODUCT MAP, which provides a trichotomy of systems, designers and users. The strategy behind the model is the separation of structure from concept and context, and hence they can be independently managed to resolve semantic conflicts between ad hoc EPCs. The major contributions of this model include the CONEX framework, collaboration mechanism and context transformation. The CONEX framework presents a formal characteri-sation and reconstruction of the structures of ad hoc EPCs based on a CONEX structure model and a CONEX grammar. It provides a formal specification for representing ad hoc EPCs including concept structure, classifier structure and mapping structure. The semantic conflicts in designing the concepts of ad hoc EPCs are resolved by a collaboration mecha-nism based on a semantic consistency model. The collaboration mechanism includes three key procedures: replicating unique concept identifiers and translating concept definitions be-tween common concepts of common EPCs; localising common concepts to local EPCs; and globalising local concepts to common EPCs. Users in the CONEX information model are not involved in any integration activities. They are provided with automatic and accurate concept exchange services through a mechanism of context transformation, which is designed based on an algorithm called Heterogeneous Concept Transformation. The separate integration of structures, concepts and contexts of ad hoc EPCs guarantees that the requirements of flexi-bility, evolvability and exactness of semantic integration have been met. Thirdly, the feasibility and features of the Collaborative Concept Exchange approach have been demonstrated in a prototype implementation that provides the services of collaborative concept design for semantic conflict resolution, and heterogeneous concept transformation for accurate and automatic concept exchange between ad hoc EPCs. A key contribution in the implementation level is the independent representation of the CONEX framework called XML PRODUCT MAP (XPM). XPM provides a feature of platform independence by con-forming to the standards of W3C XML, Simple Object Access Protocol and Web Services Description Language in both document specification and document transport. It is also a demonstration that the generic CONEX structure model and CONEX grammar can be imple-mented in any specific language such as XML for the particular scenarios of semantic integra-tion. With the aid of a collection of XPM document templates, two components called Con-cept Collaborator and Concept Transformer of the CONEX prototype are implemented to demonstrate how concepts are collaboratively designed to resolve semantic conflicts and how concepts are automatically and accurately exchanged between autonomous, heterogeneous and distributed ad hoc EPCs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic markets</field><field name="subject">semantics communication</field><field name="subject">electronic product catalogues</field><field name="subject">CONEX information model</field><field name="subject">CONEX framework</field><field name="subject">Simple Object Access Protocol</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050824.125257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vocalizations in the Grey Butcherbird Cracticus Torquatus with Emphasis on Structure in Male Breeding Song: Implications for the Function and Evolution of Song from a Study of a Southern Hemisphere Species.</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Gayle</field><field name="description">An undue focus on Temperate Zone oscines (songbirds or passerines) has led to a geographical bias in interpretation of song frmnction and evolution. This bias led initially to relatively simplistic theories of the ftmnction of bird song with vocalizations divided into 'songs' and 'calls'. Songs were complex, learned vocalizations, given by males in the breeding season, thnctioning in territory defence and mate attraction and stimulation. Calls, on the other hand, were simple innate vocalizations serving more immediate needs such as begging for food and raising an alarm. Female song, where it occurred, was considered an aberration. Further studies suggested that complex songs were associated with mate attraction functions while simpler songs were associated with territory defence. However it became apparent that the distinction between songs and calls was not nearly so clear-cut and the supposed connection between complexity and function in song was questioned. Moreover it was realised that female song could not be dismissed as a mere aberration. Another problem was the ftmnction of the dawn chorus, where research had failed to find a consistent, all-encompassing explanation. Since most studies had been done on Northern Hemisphere songbirds, it was becoming clear that the geographical focus needed to be broadened. The life histories of Northern Hemisphere TemperateZone songbirds are very different from those in many other regions. In contrast to the situation in this zone, maintenance of year-round territory, territory defence by both male and female, life-long social monogamy and extensive female vocalization are widespread in tropical, subtropical and Southern Hemisphere regions. Recently it has been suggested that more intensive studies of vocalizations in these regions might help clariQi some of these issues and consequently an endemic Australian passerine was chosen for the current study. The study focused on the vocalizationsof the grey butcherbird Cracticus torquatus Artamidae, which displays the life history features described above. The main study population was located in the Brisbane suburbs of Rainworth and Bardon. Additional data were gathered from other Brisbane suburbs and bushland sites within the city and at Lake Broadwater near Dalby, Queensland. Vocalizations were initially recorded electronically and analysed using Canary sound editing program. Vocalization data were supplemented using an aural recording method, which was independently checked for reliability. Behavioural data including posture during vocalizations and interactions with other birds were also gathered. Initial investigationsrevealed the existence of two main categories of vocalizations - those given by the family group during the day, all year round and those given at dawn by males during the breeding season. For the focal study populations, group vocalizations were studied throughout the year over several years, however the song given at dawn by males during the breeding season proved to be quite complex and three birds from three territories in the main study area were chosen as case studies. Recordings were made of the vocalizations of the three case study birds over three breeding seasons. Starting and fmishing times (with respect to civil twilight) were recorded in order to determine both changes in song bout duration and starting time throughout the breeding season. Additional birds from the same area, from the other Brisbane suburbs and from the bushland sites were studied to check the validity of conclusions drawn from the case studies. The results of the investigations revealed a vocalization structure that contrasted strongly with the simple picture of bird song drawn from study ofNorthernHemisphere Temperate Zone passerines. The vocalizations given during the day, often referred to as the 'song' of this species, were very different from the early dawn song given by the male during the breeding season. This latter appeared to be song sensu stricto according to the paradigms developed for Northern Hemisphere birds. The thytime vocalizations, however, fitted neither the classic definition of 'song' nor the classic definition of 'call'. This relatively long-term study revealed different starting time patterns and periodicity for thy vocalizations and male breeding season song. Day vocalizations commenced at a fairly constant time with respect to civil twilight throughoutthe year but breeding season song started progressively earlier from the beginning through to the middle of the season then progressively later till the end of the season. Relative finishing time of breeding song however remained constant so that the duration of breeding season song gradually increased then decreased paralleling the change in starting times. A consequence of the two distinct classes of vocalizations was that there were essentially two distinct 'dawn choruses'. One, consisting of group vocals, was sung all year round; the other was given by males singing 'breeding season' song. Since there was no reason the expect that a single function would necessarily be ascribed to both choruses, this raised the possibility that some of the confusion surrounding the ftinction and nature of the 'dawn chorus' originated from a failure to recognize the existence of two such choruses. Variation in time and space showed ifirther differences between the two vocalization classes. The breeding song of each male was distinctly different from that of his neighbours and there was a marked change in the repertoire of any individual from one year to the next. In marked contrast, daytime vocalization repertoires of neighbouring groups were virtually indistinguishable and changed little from year to year. These findings, together with information from recent literature, suggested that the two song classes had a different ontogeny, function and possibly evolution. It was proposed that territory declaration was the function of dawn singing by grey butcherbird family groups but that the function most consistent with adult male dawn song was attraction of females for extra-pair copulations. It was suggested that chorusing itself was to some extent an accidental by-product of the advantage to the individual or group of singing at dawn although a recently proposed function, the social dynamics function, could not be ruled out. Further differences from the Northern Hemisphere situation were detected in subsong. First, subsong was given by birds in their first year and also by adult males. The finding of subsong in adult males was not without precedent as it has been documented previously for a small number of passerines, especially those that change repertoire from year to year. Subsong in young (first year) birds, however, was unusual in that birds practised in small groups rather than in the complete isolation usually associated with subsong. Moreover they did not practise adult male song but instead practised group daytime vocalizations. It was suggested that it was important for birds to learn to sing in company for the important task of group territory defence. Further investigation of the literature and observations during the present study revealed similar vocalization classes and behaviours in other members of the Artamidae and other endemic Australasian taxa. These literature investigations also revealed that the possession two song vocalization classes was quite widespread although they tended to be restricted (but not exclusive) to males rather than found in males and females. These findings led to furtherresearch into the significanceofAustraliain the evolution of songbirds, the role of co-operative breeding in Australianpasserines, and finally to an hypothesis for a possible origin of male bird song. It is suggested that male song arose in a social environment where the male and female were in frequent vocal communication. If the tendency to seek extra-pair copulations (EPCs) and female choice had already been incorporated into the suite of passerine behaviours, it would be necessary to avoid the mate during such activities and the male would need to advertise with a signal distinct from group vocalizations. Early dawn, with poor light conditions, could be a favourable time for these activities. Thus it is proposed that the ancestral condition was with all group members singing most vocalisations, the intermediate situation was similar to that in the grey butcherbird and the 'advanced' condition was where female and other group member vocalizations (other than calls) have dropped out and only male song remains.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Passerine songs</field><field name="subject">Butcherbird songs</field><field name="subject">oscines</field><field name="subject">songbirds</field><field name="subject">male breeding songs</field><field name="subject">bird vocalizations</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051103.111004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being At Its Most Elusive: The Experience of Long-Term Mechanical Ventilation in a Critical Care Unit</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Patricia Lee</field><field name="description">This research study explored the meanings former patients attributed to being on long-term mechanical ventilation in a critical care unit (CCU). An interpretive phenomenological-ontological perspective informed by the philosophical tenets of Heidegger (1927/1962) was used to examine the lived experience of a group of people who had previously been hospitalised in one of three critical care units in southeast Queensland, Australia, during which time they were on a mechanical ventilator for a period of seven days or more.  Data were collected using 14 unstructured audio-taped interviews from participants, who had indicated that they were willing and able to recall aspects of their critical care experience.  The data were analysed using the method developed by van Manen (1990).  A total of nine people participated in the study, of which six were male and three female.  Their ages ranged from 21 to 69 years.  Thematic analysis of the data revealed four themes: Being thrown into an uneveryday world; Existing in an uneveryday world; Reclaiming the everyday world; and Reframing the experience. Throughout the description of these themes, excerpts from the interviews with the participants are provided to demonstrate, and bring to light the meaning and interpretations constructed.  From this thematic analysis, a phenomenological description drawing on Heidegger's tenets of Being was constructed.   Titled Being at its most elusive, this description showed that participants experienced momentary lapses of: situation, engagement, concern and care, temporality, and the ability to self-interpret.  These findings highlight and affirm the relevance of Heidegger's ontological tenets to reveal Being. The findings of this study served as a basis for a number of recommendations relating to nursing practice, education and research.  Recommendations relating to practice include: constructing a more patient-friendly critical care environment, increased involvement of patients and their families in decision making and patient care activities; ensuring adequate critical care nursing staff levels; ensuring and maintaining appropriate skill level of critical care nurses; enhancing methods of communication with patients; planning for effective patient discharge and adoption of a designated nurse position for discharge planning; providing opportunities for follow up contact of patients once they are discharged from CCU; and promoting the establishment of follow up services for former CCU patients, and their families. Recommendations relating to critical care education include: incorporating more in-depth information of the psychological and social aspects of patient and family care into care planning; incorporating communication and counselling education and training to assist nurses caring for mechanically ventilated patients, and their families; further education regarding the role and responsibilities of patient discharge planning from CCU; incorporating more advanced research skills training and utilisation of research findings into practice; and the provision of appropriate and ongoing training and education in areas such as manual handling and communication skills for all health care staff involved in the direct care of CCU patients. This study also recommended that further research be undertaken to: examine and compare different sedative and analgesic protocols and their effects on the incidence of nightmares and hallucinations reported by CCU patients; replicate this study in a group of patients from different cultural or ethnic backgrounds; evaluate the efficacy of current methods for communicating with intubated and mechanically ventilated patients in the CCU; develop, test and evaluate the efficacy of new methods for communicating with intubated and mechanically ventilated patients in the CCU; examine CCU patients' perceived level of control and power; explore the extent and type of involvement patients would like to have in their care whilst in the CCU; investigate the extent and type of problems experienced by CCU patients after discharge; explore the usefulness and appropriateness of personal diaries for individual patients as an aid to assist in understanding and resolving their CCU experience; and examine the value of follow up contacts by CCU staff to former patients and their families.  In summary, the findings from this study add substantial knowledge to critical care nurses' understanding and knowledge about what it means to be on long-term mechanical ventilation in a critical care unit.  Findings will help inform future critical care nursing practice and education, and the provision of holistic and evidenced-based care.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical care units</field><field name="subject">CCU</field><field name="subject">CCUs</field><field name="subject">critical care patients</field><field name="subject">mechanical ventilation</field><field name="subject">mechanical ventilators</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="subject">phenomenological</field><field name="subject">ontological</field><field name="subject">being</field><field name="subject">critical care nursing</field><field name="subject">nurse and patient</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030926.154232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communicating Courts: an Analysis of the Changing Interface Between the Courts and the Media</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Jane Louise</field><field name="description">This research investigates the changing relationship between the courts and the news media in Australia. While providing a broad historical context for this relationship, it focuses specifically on the past decade and the significant changes in communications practice within many Australian court jurisdictions. The study critically examines the role of public information officers (PIOs) in the Australian court system from 1993. It also investigates debates around experimentation with television cameras in Australian courts. It further critically examines other initiatives, undertaken by the courts through the PIO, including the development of court-media liaison committees, judgment summaries, websites and standardised request forms. This investigation brings together a range of perspectives about the court-media relationship. The findings are based on responses from 32 semi-structured interviews, conducted across seven jurisdictions in Australia over 28 months. Those interviewed include judges, PIOs, television reporters, news directors and newspaper reporters. The findings show overwhelming support for the role of PIO in facilitating access, improving communication, fostering a better understanding between the courts and the media and enhancing accuracy in court reportage. They indicate that those jurisdictions with PIOs in office are better at meeting the needs of the news media than the single jurisdiction that does not employ a PIO. In contrast, the issue of television camera access to courts has been marked by inconsistencies across the different groups of respondents. While the courts have generally been proactive in this area, news directors are ambivalent, even dismissive, about advancing moves. Progress has been slow, to the point of stalling in this area. This research is positioned within a field described as 'under-researched' and 'incompletely theorized'. It deals with uncharted research territory, particularly in the analysis of how the news media perceive their own role in the court-media interface. In delving into how the courts and media intersect, it forces an analysis of open justice and investigates the practice, policy, theoretical and philosophical assumptions and traditions of this relationship. Central to any relationship with the media is the source-reporter connection and this is analysed in the context of courts. It is argued that, consistent with the relatively low-level of analysis into the courts-media interface in general, sources on the court round have been inconsistent and disparate, reinforcing problems and irregularities for reporters on the round. Theories of sources as bureaucratic channels of information and primary definers of news provide a theoretical position for the emergence of the PIO. Critical elements that underpin the research are the importance of the media as presenting the courts to the wider community, through open justice, as well as the news media's role as the Fourth Estate in monitoring all aspects of society, including the judiciary and the courts. While the courts and the media must work together, they must also remain separate if the are to function effectively within a democracy. The investigation concludes that they should have 'separate but interlocking functions' in the public sphere. The research is framed around ideas of courts as part of the public sphere. It argues that developments aimed at enhancing communication between courts and the media have also improved the position of courts within that sphere. The intersections are viewed through concepts of ideal speech, communicative action and shared lifeworld. Individually and collectively, these provide a solid 'best practice' approach to how courts and the media can work together. These ideas are shown as a cycle of communication, represented as a communication model between courts, media and the public. Whilst originating from the work of Jurgen Habermas, these ideas have evolved to include a variety of perspectives and have, in this thesis, been employed to provide the theoretical framework for an analysis of the changing court-media interface.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">News media</field><field name="subject">Australian Court system</field><field name="subject">Court media interface</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050822.142709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biggs's 3P Model of Learning: The Role of Personal Characteristics and Environmental Influences on Approaches to Learning</field><field name="creator">Jones, Catherine Toni</field><field name="description">The aim of this research programme was to examine the 3P model of learning (Biggs, 1987a, 1999). The first stage necessarily involved an examination of the Study Process Questionnaire (SPQ) (Biggs, 1987a), an instrument developed to measure the process component of the model. The structure of the SPQ was examined utilising exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of undergraduate responses (n= 260). The results indicated the higher-order factor structure of deep-achieving and surface-achieving-motive provided the most reliability and a better model fit than either the subscales or scales of the SPQ.  The construct validity of the two constructs deep and surface was assessed next using a multitrait-multimethod matrix (MTMM) constructed from the three measures of the self-report questionnaire, interview ratings and written assessments from first-year students (n = 50). The results indicated good convergent validity between the deep scale of the SPQ and the interview ratings on the deep scale, between the deep scale on the SPQ and the written assessment ratings, and between the interview ratings and written assessment ratings. The results indicated good convergent validity between the surface scale on the SPQ and the interview ratings on the surface scale, but not between the surface scale on the SPQ and the written assessment ratings, and between the interview ratings and written assessment ratings. The discriminant validity between deep and surface was good for the SPQ, but not for either the interview or the written assessment. The findings indicate the deep and surface scales of the SPQ adequately measure the underlying deep and surface constructs. The retest reliability of the SPQ was then examined utilising Spearman&#146;s Rho to assess the rank-order correlations with a sample of third-year students (n=87). Over a period of three months there were significant correlations for the surface motive, surface strategy, deep strategy, achieving motive and achieving strategy subscales of the SPQ, suggesting good reliability for these subscales. The results at the scale level of the SPQ result in similar conclusions. There was a moderate significant correlation for the surface, deep and achieving scales of the SPQ, suggesting the scales have good reliability over a period of three months. There was also a moderate significant correlation for the surface-achieving-motive and deep-achieving scales over a period of three months. The stability of SPQ scores was also assessed utilising a series of one-way repeated measures MANOVA&#146;s with a sample of third-year undergraduates (n = 64). The results suggest some change occurs in self-reported use of approaches to learning between the first and third-years of an undergraduate degree programme.  The role of the teaching-learning environment was next examined. Utilising a within-subjects design, undergraduate students (n=48) concurrently enrolled in traditional (viz. lecture and tutorial) and non-traditional (viz. workshops and group projects) subjects completed the SPQ to describe their approaches to learning in each subject. A series of 2x2 repeated measures MANOVA&#146;s were undertaken. The results indicated students were likely to change their approach to learning based on their perceptions of the learning environment (traditional or non-traditional subject). However, those students identified as predominantly surface learners significantly increased their deep scale scores in the non-traditional subject when compared to deep learners.  The next study examined a range of personality (locus of control, sensing function, thinking function, intelligence) and demographic variables (age, gender, year of study) to assess which were good predictors of deep and surface approaches to learning. A series of regression analyses identified age, sensing function and locus of control as significant predictors of the surface, surface-achieving-motive, and deep approaches to learning. Locus of control was found to be a significant predictor of the deep-achieving approach to learning.  The final study examined the 3P model of learning. Based on the results of earlier studies in the research programme the situational component of the presage factors was not included. The model was examined using structural equation modelling (n= 394). Two initial models were tested using both the three (deep, surface, achieving) and two (surface-achieving-motive and deep-achieving) process factor models. The three process factor model provided the better model fit. The results suggest deep and surface approaches to learning do not mediate between personal characteristics and learning outcomes (i.e. GPA).  The results of this series of studies suggest the need for further research into the SPQ and the 3P model of learning. The implications of the research programme are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">approaches to learning</field><field name="subject">3P model of learning</field><field name="subject">Study Process Questionnaire</field><field name="subject">SPQ</field><field name="subject">multitrait-multimethod matrix</field><field name="subject">MTMM</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030304.092316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oral Assessment From the Learner's Perspective: The Experience of Oral Assessment in Post-Compulsory Education</field><field name="creator">Joughin, Gordon Rowland</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the experience of oral assessment in post-compulsory education from the student's perspective. A considerable literature has developed over the past three decades describing and analysing how students experience various aspects of learning, including various forms of assessment. Until recently, none of this literature has addressed how students experience oral assessment, and recent studies that have done so are limited in their scope and methodology - it would be true to say that very little is known about oral assessment from the student's perspective. The starting point for the consideration of oral assessment is the existing literature on oral assessment, nearly all of which has been written from the teacher's perspective. A survey of this literature identified six dimensions of oral assessment - primary content types; interaction; authenticity; structure; examiners; and orality. It is suggested that these dimensions can lead to a clearer understanding of the nature of oral assessment, a clearer differentiation of the various forms within this type of assessment, a better capacity to describe and analyse these forms, and a better understanding of how the various dimensions of oral assessment may interact with other elements of teaching and learning.  Students' experiences of oral assessment were then explored through interviews with fifteen students in a post-compulsory certificate in theology. The interviews and the analysis of the interview transcripts were strongly informed by the phenomenographic methods and conceptual framework developed by Marton and others for describing variations in how phenomena are experienced. Six aspects of students' experience of oral assessment were identified - the indirect object of learning; the direct object of learning; interaction; audience; affective responses; and comparisons with written assignments - and variations in how these aspects could be experienced are described. Relationships between these aspects suggested three contrasting conceptions of oral assessment. The conception of oral assessment as 'presentation' represents an approach to oral assessment that focuses on reproducing the ideas of others in a one-way presentation. This conception is associated with a limited sense of audience, a failure to perceive interaction as significant, and an absence of anxiety. In this case, oral assessment is seen as either similar to written assignments, or as being a more limited form of assessment than assignments. The conception of oral assessment as 'understanding' is associated with students actively seeking to develop their understanding of the subject, making the ideas they encounter their own, being challenged to understand these ideas because of the questioning involved in the assessment process, and seeing oral assessment as having some advantages over written assessment. The conception of oral assessment as 'a position to be argued' is associated with a seeing theology in terms of developing one's own point of view, having a strong sense of audience, seeing interaction with that audience as both challenging and demanding understanding, and experiencing a heightened self-awareness. In this case, oral assessment is seen as a significantly richer and more personally engaging form of assessment than written assignments. The study of oral assessment from the student's perspective extends the dimensions of oral assessment described earlier and challenges our understanding of these dimensions. The study has significant implications for teachers using oral assessment and for students who are being assessed orally, including the challenge of helping students develop more complex conceptions of oral assessment. The study also provides the basis for further research into specific aspect of oral assessment and its application in different contexts.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">post-compulsory education</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">oral assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031125.091403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of RhoA in Early Heart Development</field><field name="creator">Kaarbo, Mari</field><field name="description">RhoA is a small GTPase that acts as a molecular switch to control a variety of signal transduction pathways in eukaryotes. From an initial established role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, RhoA has now been implicated in a range of functions that include gene transcription and regulation of cell morphology. In earlier studies from this laboratory that employed differential display and in situ hybridisation, RhoA was indicated as being up-regulated during the stages of early heart development in the developing chick embryo. Given the important effects of RhoA on both gene expression and morphology in other systems, it was hypothesised that RhoA plays a central role in the molecular mechanisms controlling cardiogenesis. This thesis describes investigations undertaken to elucidate the role of RhoA in these processes. As an initial approach to corroborate the earlier gene expression findings and provide further evidence for a role in tissue developmental mechanisms, RhoA proteins levels in the developing chick embryo were analysed using immunocytochemistry. These experiments demonstrated that RhoA is most abundant in heart-forming regions, findings compatible with the earlier gene expression studies and the proposed role of this protein in early heart development. Preliminary studies from this laboratory had also suggested that chick RhoA is expressed as different length mRNA transcripts that vary only in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). This thesis presents additional evidence for the existence of these different RhoA transcripts from experiments using Northern hybridisation and RT-PCR analyses. These analyses also serve to demonstrate that the second shortest RhoA transcript (designated RhoA2) is the most abundant transcript in developing heart tissue, in contrast to the situation in other embryonic tissues, findings that could be taken to suggest a possible role for this 3'UTR in developmental mechanisms that is yet to be elucidated. One potentially informative approach for testing the function of a protein in a biological system is to inhibit its expression and/or activity and observe the changes induced. The effects of inhibiting RhoA in early heart development and early organogenesis in the chick embryo model were investigated using small interfering RNAs (siRNA). Reduction in RhoA expression by siRNA treatment, as confirmed by real-time PCR, resulted in loss of heart tube fusion and abnormal head development, the former result providing further direct evidence of a role for RhoA in heart developmental processes. In order to investigate the function of RhoA specifically during the process of cardiomyocyte differentiation, an inducible model of cardiomyogenesis, P19CL6 cells, was used in combination with over-expression of different forms of mouse RhoA. The striking result from these investigations was that over-expression of the dominant negative mutant of mouse RhoA (mRhoAN19) prevented the differentiation of induced P19CL6 cells to the cardiomyocyte phenotype, results consistent with an essential role for RhoA in this cellular transition. The mechanism by which RhoA mediates its different cellular functions is unclear, however some studies have implicated RhoA in the regulation of transcription factors. To investigate such a mechanism as a possible explanation for the requirement of RhoA in cardiomyocyte differentiation, the P19CL6 inducible cell system over-expressing different forms of RhoA was analysed through real-time PCR to quantify the levels of transcription of genes known to play an important role in early heart development. These investigations indicated that RhoA inhibition causes an accumulation of the cardiac transcription factors SRF and GATA4 and the early cardiac marker cardiac-cx-actin. The expression of a protein is controlled by, among other factors, regulatory proteins that control transcription. To investigate factors in heart that potentially regulate RhoA expression at the molecular level, the chick RhoA gene organisation was analysed. The gene was shown to contain three introns that interrupt the protein coding sequence and at least one intron in the 5'UTR. Comparative RhoA gene studies indicated both an almost identical organisation and coding sequence of the chick, mouse and human RhoA genes, indicative of strict conservation of this gene during evolution.  The putative promoter region of RhoA was predicted by computer analyses and tested for promoter activity using luciferase reporter analyses in non-differentiated and differentiated cardiomyocytes, using the inducible P19CL6 cell system. These investigations served to define a putative core promoter region that exhibited significantly higher promoter activity in differentiated cardiomyocytes than in non-differentiated cells, and other elements upstream of this core region that appear to be required for transcriptional regulation of RhoA. The majority of the consensus transcription factor sites identified in this putative promoter have been previously implicated in either heart development and/or organogenesis. These results therefore provide further, although indirect, evidence for an important role for RhoA in the molecular mechanisms controlling both cardiogenesis and embryogenesis in general. In summary, this thesis provides novel information on the role of RhoA in the processes of cardiogenesis and provides a firm foundation for continuing investigations aimed at elucidating the molecular basis of this contribution.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RhoA</field><field name="subject">GTPase</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">cardiogenesis</field><field name="subject">cardiomyogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060105.091005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Studies of Bacterial Communities in the Great Artesian Basin Aquifers</field><field name="creator">Kanso, Sungwan</field><field name="description">16S rRNA gene analysis has shown that bacterial diversity in the GAB bores studied was limited to the genera Hydrogenobacter in the phylum Aquificae, Thermus in the phylum Deinococcus-Thermus, Desulfotomaculum in the phylum Firmicutes, the alpha-, beta- and gamma-classes of the phylum Proteobacteria and the phylum Nitrospirae. There was no clone closely related to members of the delta-proteobacteria and epsilon-proteobacteria classes detected. The number of bacterial strains directly isolated from the Fairlea and the Cooinda bores were far less than the numbers of distinctive phylotypes detected by the 16S rRNA gene characterisation. In addition none of the bacterial strains directly isolated from the water samples were represented in the 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. Similar discrepancies between the bacterial populations obtained from the 16S rRNA gene analysis and those obtained from direct isolation have been reported in the literature (Dunbar et al., 1999; Kampfer et al., 1996; Suzuki et al., 1997; Ward et al., 1998; Ward et al., 1997). However, in general, the phyla with which the isolates were affiliated were the same as those phyla to which the clones belonged.  The environmental changes introduced (by bringing the artesian water up to the surface and exposing it to four types of metal coupons made of carbon steels identified by codes ASTM-A53B, ASTM-A53, AS-1074 and AS-1396 and commonly used in bore casings) led to changes in the bacterial community structures. In general, the species which proliferated in the communities before and after the changes were different. The diversity of the bacterial species in the community decreased following the environmental changes. Clones dominating the clone libraries constructed from newly established bacterial communities also differed from the clones dominating the libraries constructed from the bacterial communities which had existed naturally in the bores. These trends toward change in the bacterial communities were observed at both the Fairlea and the Cooinda bore sites. All four metal types incubated in the Fairlea bore water lost between 3.4 and 4.7% of their original weight. In contrast none of the metals incubated in Cooinda bore water lost weight. Clone library A1 showed that the natural population of the Fairlea bore was dominated by clone A1-3, which represented a novel species related to the isolate boom-7m-04. But after metal incubation (and recording of the metal weight loss), the bacterial community was dominated by clone PKA34B, which has a 95% similarity in its 16S rRNA gene sequence with Desulfotomaculum putei. Desulfotomaculum species are known to cause metal corrosion due to their byproduct H2S. But the low level of phylogenetic relatedness found does not provide enough information to speculate on whether the species represented by clone PKA34B is a member of the genus Desulfotomaculum or not. However, the fact that clone PKA34B dominated the PKA clone library by 50% makes the species it represents a suspected candidate likely to be involved with the metal weight loss at the Fairlea bore. In contrast, clone library 4381 showed that the natural population of the Cooinda bore was dominated by clone 4381-15 representing a species distantly related to a hydrogen oxidiser Hydrogenophaga flava (95% similarity). The dominating clone of the new community formed after metal incubation was clone COO25, which has 99% similarity with Thermus species that have not been reported to be involved with metal corrosion to my knowledge. In this project detection, identification and comparative quantification by 16S rRNA gene-targeted PCR probing with probes 23B and 34B were successfully developed for a Leptothrix-like species and for a Desulfotomaculum-like species represented by clones PKA23B and PKA34B respectively. This method of probing permits a fast, sensitive and reproducible detection, identification and at least a comparative quantification of the bacteria in the environment without the need for culturing. Therefore it is extremely suitable for use in bacterial population monitoring. PCR probing with the 34B probe has a potential commercial use as a means of screening for bores with a potential high risk of corrosion due to this Desulfotomaculum-like species. Direct isolation of bacteria from the GAB water has resulted in the isolation of seven strains from the Fairlea bore and eight from the Cooinda bore. Among these isolates, three novel strains were studied in detail. Reports on the characterisation of strain FaiI4T (T=Type strain) from the Fairlea bore (Kanso &amp; Patel, 2003) and strain CooI3BT from the Cooinda bore have been published (Kanso et al., 2002).  The data generated during this project add to our current information and extend our knowledge about the bacterial communities of the GAB's sub-surface environment. This information will provide a basis for further ecological studies of the GAB. Studies on involvement of certain groups of bacteria with the corrosion of metals used in bore casings could provide a foundation for further studies to develop maintenance and managing strategies for the GAB bores.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Great Artesian Basin</field><field name="subject">artesian water</field><field name="subject">bore water</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">bacterial diversity</field><field name="subject">bacterial communities</field><field name="subject">rRNA gene analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040219.140509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical Investigations of the Alkaloids from the Plants of the Family Elaeocarpaceae</field><field name="creator">Katavic, Peter L</field><field name="description">A phytochemical survey to detect alkaloids was performed on extracts of 339 discrete plants parts from a total of 77 species from five genera of Elaeocarpaceae, including 30 species from Queensland, 38 from PNG, and nine from China. An alkaloid detecting reagent, bismuth (III) tetraiodide (Dragendorff's reagent) was used in a preliminary test for alkaloids, with positive ESIMS used to confirm the presence of alkaloids. A total of 35 extracts of various plant parts produced positive results with Dragendorff's reagent. Positive ESIMS detected alkaloids in only 13 of these extracts. Bismuth (III) tetraiodide was demonstrated to produce false positive results with the new non-alkaloidal poly-oxygenated compounds 112 and 113, which were purified from the extract of Sloanea tieghemii. Two new alkaloid producing species, Elaeocarpus habbeniensis, and E. fuscoides were detected from the survey. These species were chemically investigated for the first time. Two other previously investigated species, E. grandis and Peripentadenia mearsii, were also studied. A total of 16 alkaloids, 11 of which are new, were purified from the extracts of these four species. The novel pyrrolidine alkaloids habbenine (114) and peripentonine (123), were isolated from the leaves of E. habbeniensis and Peripentadenia mearsii, respectively. Both of these compounds were purified as inseparable mixtures of diastereomers. The new pyrrolidine alkaloid mearsamine 1 (124), and the novel amino alkaloid mearsamine 2 (125), were also purified from the leaves of P. mearsii. The known pyrrolidine alkaloid peripentadenine (81), was purified from the bark of P. mearsii. Peripentonine (123) was reduced to peripentadenine (81) upon reaction with Pd/C. Four aromatic indolizidine alkaloids were isolated from the extract of the leaves of E. fuscoides. One new compound, elaeocarpenine (122), was isolated from this New Guinean plant. Three known Elaeocarpus alkaloids, isoelaeocarpicine (62), elaeocarpine (60) and isoelaeocarpine (61) were also purified from E. fuscoides. Elaeocarpenine (122) was demonstrated to produce the epimeric compounds elaeocarpine and isoelaeocarpine via reaction with ammonia. The chemical investigation of the Queensland plant E. grandis by two separate purification procedures was performed. An SCX/C18 isolation protocol was used to purify the new indolizidine alkaloids grandisine C (127), D (126), and E (128), in conjunction with the known tetracyclic indolizidine isoelaeocarpiline (63). The second purification of E. grandis was achieved with the use of ammonia in an acid/base partitioning protocol. Grandisine F (129) and G (130), and compounds 131a and b were purified by this procedure, as were 63, 126 and 127. Grandisine F and G were proposed to be ammonia adducts of grandisine D (126). Compound 131a and b were isolated as a mixture of diastereomers. The reduction of grandisine D (126) with Pd/C yielded a mixture of isoelaeocarpine (61) and elaeocarpine (60), whereas the reduction of isoelaeocarpiline (63) produced isoelaeocarpine (61). All of the alkaloids isolated from the Elaeocarpaceae, except grandisine E (128) and 131a and b, were evaluated for binding affinity against the human ? opioid receptor. Every compound except mearsamine 2 (125) possessed a binding affinity of less than 100 ?M. The most active compounds were grandisine F (129), D (126), C (127), elaeocarpenine (122), isoelaeocarpine (61), isoelaeocarpiline (63) and peripentadenine (81). The IC50 values for these compounds were 1.55, 1.65, 14.6, 2.74, 13.6, 9.86 and 11.4 ?M, respectively. The SAR of the active compounds was compared. These observations indicated that the indolizidine alkaloids were more active than the pyrrolidine alkaloids, and a phenol or ketone at position C-12 of the indolizidine alkaloids produced better binding affinity. All of these alkaloids, except 129, were proposed to interact with two of the three binding domains of the ? opioid receptor. Grandisine F (129) was proposed to have a different mode of action than the other alkaloids in the series. Synthetic modifications to isoelaeocarpine (61) and peripentadenine (81) were investigated in an attempt to incorporate an extra aromatic group into these molecules. An extra aromatic group was proposed to provide increased binding affinity to the ? opioid receptor by interaction with the third binding domain of the receptor. Two different aromatic amines were successfully attached to peripentadenine (81) by a reductive amination reaction using NaBH(OAc)3 and a titanium catalyst. The reductive amination of the ketone in isoelaecarpine (61) with various amines and NaBH(OAc)3 or NaBH4 proved unsuccessful.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elaeocarpaceae</field><field name="subject">alkaloids</field><field name="subject">aromatic indolizidine alkaloids</field><field name="subject">elaeocarpenine</field><field name="subject">isoelaeocarpine</field><field name="subject">peripentadenine</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070710.160928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic Stability of the Upper Body During Walking</field><field name="creator">Kavanagh, Justin</field><field name="description">The general purpose of this study was to examine factors that may influence acceleration characteristics of the upper body during walking, thereby clarifying the means by which the postural system facilitates dynamic stability of the upper body during walking. Upper body accelerations were measured during a range of straight-line walking tasks. Time domain, frequency domain, signal regularity and coupling analyses were used to 1) provide new insight into gait-related upper body accelerations during walking in normal healthy adults, and 2) determine how the postural system accommodates to perturbations that challenge upper body stability during walking. The specific perturbations to the postural system that were examined in the present study were the normal ageing process, changes in walking speed, and fatigue of the cervical and lumbar erector spinae. In general, the patterns of accelerations measured at the level of the head were an attenuated version of those at the lower trunk during normal walking. Power spectral analysis revealed that both the head and lower trunk in the anterior-posterior (AP) and vertical directions (VT) directions were characterised by a single peak frequency corresponding the step frequency during normal walking. However, the most notable of all attenuation profiles was the difference between accelerations of the head and lower trunk in the mediolateral (ML) direction. ML trunk accelerations were characterised by multiple low amplitude frequency peaks, which were attenuated to a single peak at the head corresponding to stride frequency. The coupling between acceleration directions was greater for the head than the lower trunk, suggesting that the postural system promotes a coordination strategy which enhances global stability of the head. Subdividing the upper body into neck and trunk segments facilitated a more comprehensive description how the gait-related oscillations are prevented from impacting on the motion of the head. Overall, acceleration amplitude, power content, and regularity were predominantly regulated by the trunk segment, especially for the AP and ML directions. This suggests that the trunk segment plays a critical role in modulating the amplitude and structure of gait-related oscillations prior to reaching the neck segment and thus the head. It was envisaged that examining factors that may challenge the individual (the normal ageing process), and the walking task (changes in walking speed, and induced fatigue of the upper body), would provide new insight into the extent to which the postural system prioritises head stability during walking. Regardless of the challenges imposed on the postural system due to the ageing process, upper body movement was organised in a manner which assisted in maintaining a degree of head stability comparable to those observed under normal walking conditions. Similarly, the importance that the postural system places on maintaining head stability was evident in the attenuation characteristics of the trunk and neck segments when walking speed was manipulated, and neuromuscular fatigue induced. Manipulating walking speed highlighted the critical role that the trunk segment has in regulating upper body accelerations arising from gait-related events. Aside from a minor contribution from the neck segment in the direction of travel at preferred and fast walking speeds, regulation of accelerations occurred due to the dynamics of the trunk segment. Inducing neuromuscular fatigue of the cervical and lumbar erector spinae groups (CES and LES) revealed compensatory movement strategies of the upper body, with a view of enhancing head stability. For several variables quantifying attenuation, fatiguing one muscle group, such as the CES, resulted in changes in the dynamics of another level of the upper body, such as the trunk segment. The trunk segment was particularly dominant in regulating upper body accelerations under fatigued conditions, further reinforcing the importance to control accelerations prior to reaching the neck and head. Overall, the results of this study suggest that optimal head stability is reliant on the trunk segment providing a stable base of support for the neck and head. By regulating accelerations via the trunk segment, the postural system is effectively regulating the orientation of the neck and head, and the inclusive sensory organs. It was evident that the postural system prioritises, and in general, maintains head stability during walking despite challenges imposed on upper body stability.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Walking</field><field name="subject">upperbody characteristics</field><field name="subject">human trunk</field><field name="subject">postural system</field><field name="subject">gait and upper body</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070219.172055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arakawa and Gins: The Practice of Embodied Cognition</field><field name="creator">Keane, Jondi</field><field name="description">This thesis will examine the works of artists-turned-architects, Arakawa and Gins in light of current research in the arts and sciences on affect and self-organisation. The aim of their project is to arrive at a 'daily research' in which a person may: 1. observe and learn about the operations of his or her own perception and action; 2. interact (dismantle and re-assemble) the identity boundaries reinforced by the habitual implementation of concept and category. This thesis takes account of multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to embodiment and engages Arakawa and Gins from a practising artist's point of view. Given this practical orientation of the study, the aim is to makes a series of critical reflections on the work of Arakawa and Gins and demonstrate how such an approach brings theory and practice together. Exploration of the central aspects of their processes will prepare a person (researcher or practitioner) to begin a practice that is designed to combine studies of embodiment with the co-evolving relationship of organisms and their surroundings, to form the basis of a practice of embodied cognition. The thesis sets out this investigation into three chapters. In Chapter 1, I propose that the context for Arakawa and Gins' work be understood as the result of multidisciplinary interarticulations and multi-modal approaches to embodied activity. The position they occupy in relation to disciplinary endeavours such as art, architecture, psychology, bio-topology and theoretical physics is a process of constant problematisation, convergence and repositioning. A survey of key writings on Arakawa and Gins demonstrates the complexity of their work and the difficulties authors encounter situating them within a context that adequately addresses the scope of their project. In Chapter 2, I map a series of activities that accrue to form embodied configurations made perceptible by Arakawa and Gins' procedural architecture. These tactics apply to the observational-heuristic stance they take towards the perceptions and actions that constitute a person's identity boundaries as well as the transformational approach they take towards perceptions and actions that construct the material surrounds. I propose that the movements initiated by their architectural procedures become the practice of embodied cognition. That is, the ability to increase awareness and construct the shape of awareness is, at the same time, the ability to observe and learn about the anatomical, physiological basis of cognition. Through &#198;ffective readings and embodied engagements I explore how Arakawa and Gins propose that the distribution of awareness may reconfigure the relationships among the organism-person-surround. The practice that repositions a person in relation to him- or herself, to others, to constructions of knowledge and modes of acquiring knowledge, questions the autonomy of any construct, especially constructs that are historically entrenched such as the organism, art, science or agency in general. In Chapter 3, I argue that by investigating the connection between and across the organism, person and surround, a person must reconsider activities, such as judgment and Reason, as ongoing embodied processes. The implication of such a shift impacts upon everyday practices as well as vocational and professional practices aligned with research and development. Throughout this thesis I argue that tactics of Arakawa and Gins' procedural architecture and the ethics of their reversible destiny project are the most productive way to approach the practical and theoretical inquiry into the contributions that humans can make towards co-constructing the world. The complex and intricate processes that emerge from their work will enhance the quality of life by allowing persons to apply the benefits of research in art and science to everyday actions. By devising procedures for re-entering perception and action, the transition from self-awareness to a practice of embodied cognition acquires a renewed urgency for daily life. Further, I have suggested that Arakawa and Gins' works demonstrates how deliberate recursive action may become a practice of embodied cognition. This occurs in three ways. Firstly, any form of deliberate assessment and coordination of top-down conceptual-analytical processing and bottom-up perceptual processing will open the activities of reasoning, selecting, deciding, and judging to new embodied modes of knowledge acquisition and therefore to unprecedented configurations of value. Secondly, the reconfiguration of what counts as knowledge, from an ontological perspective, impacts upon research processes and the way in which research cultures are situated in relation to communities. Lastly, the practice of embodied cognition sets a new agenda for convergent 'daily research' especially the interaction between art and the 'outside of art' and between third-person science and the science of our own fiction. These practical actions will counteract our commitment to closure on many fronts, both personal and historical, from the education of the senses to the construction of social justice.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arakawa</field><field name="subject">Gins</field><field name="subject">M</field><field name="subject">architects</field><field name="subject">artists-turned-architects</field><field name="subject">embodiment</field><field name="subject">multidisciplinary interarticulations</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070122.165000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Transformation of the Democratic Party in Italy 1989-2000: A Case Sudy in Venice</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Claire</field><field name="description">The fall of the Berlin Wall and the announcement by the leader of the Italian Communist Party (PCI), Achille Occhetto, that the time had come to shed its communist name and identity inaugurated a decade of uncertainty and change for the party. As the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), it faced the challenge of developing its post-communist identity amid the upheaval in the Italian political system that followed the Tangentopoli (Bribesville) scandal. The transition to the 'Second Republic', spurred by widespread anti-party sentiment, brought new electoral systems and forms of coalition-making, a changed array of allies and opponents, a personalisation of certain political roles, and changed relationships between the national and local dimensions of politics. In 2000, now called the Left Democrats (DS), the party was the largest component in the nationally governing coalition and even provided the prime minister. Yet the rise to the pinnacle of power had been accompanied by decreasing electoral support. In over ten years of post-communist life, the party had failed to achieve the real breakthrough hoped for by Occhetto: to unite the Italian left in a single party that dominated government or opposition, as in other Western European countries. The primary aim of this thesis is to contribute to understanding the party's fortunes through a case study of the way the turbulent years from 1989 to 2000 were experienced in the Venetian provincial federation. This decade of change has so far not been examined from a local perspective, yet local studies were particularly fruitful in the analysis of the PCI, as they allowed exploration of the ways party debates were perceived, and decisions made at national level were implemented, 'on the ground' in specific contexts. I have not chosen the Venetian federation as a microcosm of the experience in the periphery as a whole but as an interesting and relevant component of the full picture. The Venetian party enjoyed greatly increased responsibilities in government at sub-national levels in the second half of the 1990s, due to successful alliance strategies, but decreasing electoral support. I seek to explain the local party's electoral and power outcomes in terms of a combination of external and internal factors: on one hand, the opportunities and constraints presented by the changing environment; and, on the other, internal dynamics that hampered the party in responding to those challenges. In particular I stress the significance of the crisis precipitated by Occhetto's proposal to transform the party in 1989 and the constraints on the local party's legitimacy and visibility in the competitive environment that developed in the Second Republic. I attribute these constraints to the mixed electoral systems operating at sub-national levels, intra-coalition rivalry, and a striking case of an individual enjoying personal power and influence in the local political system. As a secondary theme, I analyse change in the party type that accompanied these outcomes, in light of theories on general trends in party transformations in Western Europe. I identify rapid changes in the local party's aims, functions and organisational roles and relationships, and in its relationship with the national leadership. I argue that this process of change, consistent with the transformation of a mass party into an electorally focused party, was accelerated at local level by the changing competitive environment and the sudden increase in government responsibilities. The introduction in chapter 1 sets the party's story in context and outlines the aims and argument of the thesis. Chapter 2 introduces the local case study in light of existing analyses of the party's development, the tradition of local studies of the PCI, and theories on party types and transformations. The central chapters are dedicated to the case study, which is based largely on interviews with members of the federation's leadership groups in various periods. The organisation of the material reflects my division of the federation's story into distinct phases, each reflecting a stage in the development of both the party's alliance strategy and the local political system. In the concluding chapter, I discuss the implications of the case study findings for the party as a whole and make a claim for the continuing validity of local studies of Italian political parties.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Party of the Democratic Left (Italy)</field><field name="subject">Left Democrats (Italy)</field><field name="subject">Venetian federation</field><field name="subject">Italian Communist Party</field><field name="subject">Italian politics</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070208.095410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constraints on the Control of Physiological Tremor</field><field name="creator">Keogh, Justin W. L</field><field name="description">This thesis sought to: 1) examine the effect of a number of organism and task constraints on the control of two forms of physiological tremor, namely postural and finger-pinch force tremor; and 2) determine if the expected constraint-related changes in tremor output were associated with alterations in the control strategy utilised by the performer.  The organism constraints were age and resistance-training (for both forms of tremor), while the task constraints were visual feedback, target size and limb preference (postural tremor) and mean force, target shape and limb preference (force tremor). The postural (index finger) tremor amplitude of young adults was significantly greater in the augmented vision (AV) than normal vision (NV) conditions and when using the non-preferred than preferred limb.  Even greater differences/changes in postural tremor amplitude were observed as a function of aging and training.  Older adults had significantly more index finger tremor amplitude than young adults. Regardless, the older adults who completed a six weeks program of unilateral strength- or coordination-training were able to significantly reduce their tremor amplitude.  Although the training-related reductions in tremor amplitude were of a greater magnitude for the trained than untrained limb, a significant reduction in the tremor amplitude of the untrained limb was also observed for the coordination-training group.  All of these significant differences/changes in tremor amplitude were associated with significant changes in a number of other dependent variables.  For example, the task- and age-related increases in tremor amplitude were primarily a result of greater 8-12 Hz tremor power and were associated with increased EMG activity/co-activation of the extensor digitorum (ED) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles and a significant reduction in intra-limb (index finger-hand and forearm-upper arm) coupling.  The significant reductions in tremor amplitude observed for the resistance-trained older adults was a result of a significant decline in 8-12 Hz power and were associated with a significant reduction in ED and FDS co-activation.  However, no significant change in intra-limb coupling was observed. The overall trends observed in the results for the finger-pinch force tremor experiments were similar to those for postural tremor.  Older adults had significantly more finger-pinch force tremor (i.e. force variability and targeting error) than young adults, although older adults who performed six weeks of unilateral strength-training were able to significantly reduce the force variability and targeting error of the trained limb.  No significant training-related reduction in force tremor was however observed for the untrained limb.  The significant age-related increase in force tremor was a result of greater low frequency (less than  2 Hz) power and was associated with a significant loss of inter-digit force sharing and coupling as well as tactile sensitivity. Interestingly, the training-related decreases in force tremor were not associated with significant changes in any of the frequency, sharing or coupling measures. Collectively, the results of the five experiments contained in this thesis add much to our understanding of postural and force tremor.  Results indicated that numerous task and organism constraints can have a substantial effect on the resulting tremor output. Furthermore, the task- and age-related differences in the power spectral, muscle activity and coupling measures suggested that the changes in tremor output were the result of the use of an altered (sub-optimal) control strategy.  The age-related increase in postural and force tremor amplitude may therefore reflect not only an overall decline in neuromuscular system function, but also the relative inability of older adults to effectively coordinate the output of numerous degrees of freedom (limb segments).  The effect of the aging process on tremor output was somewhat reversible, with the older adults who performed resistance-training significantly improving their control of both postural and force tremor.  There was some evidence that resistance-training could produce cross-education effects in older adults, although these were only statistically significant for postural tremor amplitude in the coordination-training group and for wrist flexion strength in the strength-training group. The relative brevity of the training program (6 weeks) and the observable cross-education effects suggest that the reduction in tremor amplitude and increases in strength were primarily a result of neural adaptations.  Such findings further support  the prescription of resistance-training for improving physical function in older individuals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physiological tremor</field><field name="subject">postural tremor</field><field name="subject">finger-pinch force tremor</field><field name="subject">tremor amplitude</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070208.110453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conversations with the bunyip : the idea of the wild in imagining, planning, and celebrating place through metaphor, memoir, mythology, and memory</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Tamsin</field><field name="description">What lies beneath Our cultured constructions? The wild lies beneath. The mud and the mad, the bunyip Other, lies beneath. It echoes through our layered metaphors We hear its memories Through animal mythology in wilder places Through emotive imagination of landscape memoir Through mythic archaeologies of object art. Not the Nation, but the land has active influence. In festivals of bioregion, communities re-member its voice. Our creativity goes to what lies beneath. This thesis explores the ways we develop deeper and wilder connections to specific regional and local landscapes using art, festival, mythology and memoir. It argues that we inhabit and understand the specific nature of our locale when we plan space for the non-human and creatively celebrate culture-nature coalitions. A wilder and more active sense of place relies upon community cultural conversations with the mythic, represented in the Australian exemplar of the bunyip. The bunyip acts as a metaphor for the subaltern or hidden culture of a place. The bunyip is land incarnate. No matter how pristine the wilderness or how concrete the urban, every region has its localised bunyip-equivalent that defines, and is shaped by, its community and their environmental relationships. Human/non-human cohabitations might be actively expressed through art and cultural experience to form a wilder, more emotive landscape memoir. This thesis discusses a diverse range of landstories, mythologies, environmental art, and bioregional festivities from around Australasia with a special focus on the Sunshine Coast or Gubbi-Gubbi region. It suggests a subaltern indigenous influence in how we imagine, plan and celebrate place. The cultural discourses of metaphor, memoir, mythology and memory shape land into landscapes. When the metaphor is wild, the memoir celebratory, the mythology animal, the memory creative and complex, our ways of being are ecocentric and grounded. The distinctions between nature and culture become less defined; we become native to country. Our multi-cultured histories are written upon the earth; our community identities shape and are shaped by the land. Together, monsters and festivals remind us of the active land.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bunyip</field><field name="subject">regional landscapes</field><field name="subject">local landscapes</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">festival</field><field name="subject">mythology and memoir</field><field name="subject">culture-nature coalitions</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070814.160841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aboriginal Dreaming Tracks or Trading Paths: The Common Ways</field><field name="creator">Kerwin, Dale Wayne</field><field name="description">This thesis recognises the great significance of 'walkabout' as a major trading tradition whereby the Dreaming paths and songlines formed major ceremonial routes along which goods and knowledge flowed. These became the trade routes that criss-crossed Australia and transported religion and cultural values. The thesis also highlights the valuable contribution Aboriginal people made in assisting the European explorers, surveyors, and stockmen to open the country for colonisation, and it explores the interface between Aboriginal possession of the Australian continent and European colonisation and appropriation. Instead of positing a radical disjunction between cultural competencies 'before' and 'after', the thesis considers how European colonisation of Australia (as with other colonial settings) appropriated Aboriginal competence in terms of the landscape: by tapping into culinary and medicinal knowledge, water and resource knowledge, hunting, food collecting and path-finding. As a consequence of this assistance, Aboriginal Dreaming tracks and trading paths also became the routes and roads of colonisers. This dissertation seeks to reinstate Aboriginal people into the historical landscape of Australia. From its beginnings as a footnote in Australian history, Aboriginal society, culture, and history has moved into the preamble, but it is now time to inscribe Aboriginal people firmly in the body of Australian history.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dreaming paths</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australian society</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australian ceremonial routes</field><field name="subject">songlines</field><field name="subject">European colonisation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070327.144524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Critical Analysis of Jurisdiction in International Litigation</field><field name="creator">Keyes, Mary Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis critically analyses the Australian law of jurisdiction in private international litigation. Jurisdiction in international litigation is often regarded as a procedural area of law which is less important than choice of law in practical and theoretical terms. There has been little scholarly attention devoted specifically to the study of jurisdiction in Australia. In recent years, jurisdiction has certainly overtaken choice of law in practical importance. This emphasises the need for critical academic study of the law of jurisdiction. This thesis addresses this need. It critically analyses the present principles and the manner in which they are applied, identifies the factors which should influence the law, and proposes appropriate reforms to the principles. This thesis is in five related parts. The first part examines the procedural and constitutional context in which the principles of jurisdiction have been developed and applied. This context has important implications for the law and practice of jurisdiction, which have largely been overlooked in the literature, although they are important in understanding how the principles have developed and how they are applied. The second part critically analyses the present law of jurisdiction. The Australian principles of jurisdiction have not changed substantially in the last 100 years, while economic and social conditions which affect international litigation have undergone dramatic and wide-reaching changes. The present law provides that the courts are jurisdictionally competent in a wide range of cases, which do not all require a substantial connection between the dispute and the forum. The various principles applied in declining jurisdiction make it likely that the Australian courts will exercise their discretion to retain jurisdiction in the majority of cases. Foreign jurisdictional agreements should be enforced by a stay unless there are strong reasons for non- enforcement. But the application of overriding mandatory rules, even where there is a jurisdictional agreement, and the courts' wide discretion under the Australian forum non conveniens principle make it unlikely that the courts will decline to exercise jurisdiction. The present principles, in short, permit the courts to take jurisdiction in too many cases, and require them to decline to exercise jurisdiction in too few cases. The third part examines how the principles on declining jurisdiction operate in practice. This is addressed by a doctrinal and an empirical analysis of the manner in which these principles are applied by the Australian superior courts. These analyses identify factors which appear to influence decisions in practice, not all of which are consistent with the applicable principles. For example, the principle requires the court to enforce foreign jurisdictional agreements unless there are strong grounds for non-enforcement. In practice, strong grounds are easily shown. These analyses show that there are factors which influence decisions which are not always apparent from the principles, suggesting that reform is required. The fourth part identifies the factors which ought to influence the law and practice of jurisdiction. The relevant factors are identified in terms of the interests of foreign states, individual litigants' interests and the forum state's interests. The law and practice of jurisdiction are examined to determine whether those interests do in fact influence law and practice. Many important interests, especially of foreign states and of defendants, are not sufficiently taken into account. This also implies that reform of the principles is warranted. The fifth part considers how Australian jurisdictional principles could be improved. Detailed reforms are suggested, drawing on a discussion and an evaluation of different approaches to jurisdiction, particularly drawing on the European Community's Regulation on Jurisdiction and Judgments. The principles should ensure that the court is jurisdictionally competent only where it is likely to be an appropriate forum for the dispute. The proposed reforms identlfy grounds of exclusive jurisdiction, provide protection to weaker parties to contracts, and otherwise require the enforcement of jurisdictional agreements. Default rules of jurisdiction which are likely to indicate a strong connection between the forum and the dispute are proposed. Specific principles for declining jurisdiction are also proposed. Retention of the forum non conveniens principle is recommended, but the English principle is advocated as a more suitable and just approach. This thesis is intended to contribute both to a theoretical understanding of this area of law and to an understanding of its practical application.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International litigation</field><field name="subject">Australian law of jurisdiction</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051214.143910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grown-Ups In a Grown-Up Business: Children's Television Industry Development Australia</field><field name="creator">Keys, Wendy</field><field name="description">This dissertation profiles the children's television industry in Australia; examines the relationship between government cultural policy objectives and television industry production practices; and explores the complexities of regulating and producing cultural content for child audiences. The research conducted between 1997 and 2002 confirms that children's television is a highly competitive business dependent on government regulatory mechanisms and support for its existence. For example, the Australian Broadcasting Authority's retaining of mandatory program standards for children's programs to date, is evidence of the government's continued recognition of the conflict between broadcasters' commercial imperatives and the public-interest. As a consequence, the industry is on the one hand insistent on the government continuing to play a role in ensuring and sustaining CTV - however, on the other hand, CTV producers resent the restrictions on creativity and innovation they believe result from the use of regulatory instruments such as the Children's Television Standards (CTS). In fact, as this dissertation details, the ABA's intended policy outcomes are inevitably coupled with unintended outcomes and little new or innovative policy development has occurred. The dissertation begins with an investigation into the social, cultural and ideological construction of childhood within an historical and institutional context. I do this in order to explore how children have been defined, constructed and managed as a cultural group and television audience. From this investigation, I then map the development of children television policy and provide examples of how 'the child' is a consistent and controversial site of tension within policy debate. I then introduce and analyse a selection of established, establishing and aspiring CTV production companies and producers. Drawing on interviews conducted, production companies profiled and policy documents analysed, I conclude by identit~'ing ten key issues that have impacted, and continue to impact, on the production of children's television programming in Australia. In addressing issues of industry development, the question this dissertation confronts is not whether to continue to regulate or not, but rather, how best to regulate. That is, it explores the complexities of supporting, sustaining and developing the CTV industry in ways which also allows innovative and creative programming. This exploration is done within the context of a broadcasting industry currently in transition from analogue to digital. As communications and broadcasting technologies converge, instruments of regulation - such as quotas designed around the characteristics of analogue systems of broadcasting - are being compromised. The ways in which children use television, and the ways in which the CTV producers create content, are being transformed. The ten key issues identified in this dissertation, I propose, are crucial to industry development and policy debate about the future of children's television in Australia. In integrating the study of policy with the study of production, I have given prominence to the opinions and experiences of those working in the industry. In doing so, this dissertation contributes to the growing body of work in Australia which incorporates industry with cultural analysis, and which includes the voices of the content providers.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children's television industry</field><field name="subject">government cultural policy</field><field name="subject">Australian Broadcasting Authority</field><field name="subject">CTV</field><field name="subject">Children's Television Standards</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060928.135325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dimensionality Reduction Using Factor Analysis</field><field name="creator">Khosla, Nitin</field><field name="description">In many pattern recognition applications, a large number of features are extracted in order to ensure an accurate classification of unknown classes. One way to solve the problems of high dimensions is to first reduce the dimensionality of the data to a manageable size, keeping as much of the original information as possible and then feed the reduced-dimensional data into a pattern recognition system. In this situation, dimensionality reduction process becomes the pre-processing stage of the pattern recognition system. In addition to this, probablility density estimation, with fewer variables is a simpler approach for dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction is useful in speech recognition, data compression, visualization and exploratory data analysis. Some of the techniques which can be used for dimensionality reduction are; Factor Analysis (FA), Principal Component Analysis(PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA). Factor Analysis can be considered as an extension of Principal Component Analysis. The EM (expectation maximization) algorithm is ideally suited to problems of this sort, in that it produces maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of parameters when there is a many-to-one mapping from an underlying distribution to the distribution governing the observation, conditioned upon the obervations. The maximization step then provides a new estimate of the parameters. This research work compares the techniques; Factor Analysis (Expectation-Maximization algorithm based), Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis for dimensionality reduction and investigates Local Factor Analysis (EM algorithm based) and Local Principal Component Analysis using Vector Quantization.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pattern recognition applications</field><field name="subject">dimensionality reduction</field><field name="subject">factor analysis</field><field name="subject">principal component analysis</field><field name="subject">linear discriminant analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061010.151217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Politics of Good Governance in the Asean 4</field><field name="creator">Kimmet, Philip</field><field name="description">'Good governance' is an evolving and increasingly influential discursive agenda that introduces new ideas about public policy, specifically targeting managerial behaviour and promoting modern administrative strategies. Most scholars agree that as a notion, good governance combines liberal democratic principles with a 'new public management' (NPM) approach to economic policy-making. What is less clear is who the agenda actually targets. In other words, is the good governance agenda aimed at rulers in particular or the broader population? Implicit in the answer is whether good governance concepts are simply useful tools to help build political credibility, or the agents for better managerial and administrative outcomes. In countries with advanced economies, good governance is invariably used to describe corporate and public administration strategies that invoke ethically grounded 'World's best practice' standards and procedures. However, in developing economies, good governance can take on quite different, and often unintended meanings. This thesis finds that in developing countries good governance is being expressed more as a political tool than as substantive practice and policy reform. This is occurring in an increasingly 'post-Washington consensus' environment that explicitly recognises the importance of the social impact of structural adjustment programs and broader issues of human rights. And importantly as far as this thesis is concerned, during Southeast Asia's current economic recovery, good governance has taken on a whole new relevance. This analysis commences from the assumption that good governance is a discursively created phenomenon that can be understood as a complex notion with both structural and ideational elements. The term is couched in a structure that is both economically technical and socially normative. It has overlapping central tenets driven by regulation and the institutional environment, and should not be viewed as a set of constructs in isolation from the context in which it is being used. And it is based on assumptions about common sense attitudes and shared common good objectives. And as this thesis will demonstrate, good governance functions within an unpredictable and often hostile political environment in which powerful actors are learning to use this new discourse to satisfy political expediencies. Put simply, good governance is nourishing a politics of its own. The thesis uses the ASEAN 4 countries of Southeast Asia: the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, as individual and comparative case studies. The studies examine how the concept is shaping the institutional structure of these countries, and includes commentary on the role of good governance in the 2004 round of election campaigning. A genealogy of good governance will be developed in these local contexts, and more generally. This will assist in mapping the concept's evolution in relation to development trajectories and local politics. The hypothesis under examination is - that the good governance agendas in the ASEAN 4 states primarily focus on improving representative rule rather than encouraging self-regulation. Two questions in particular are asked in each of the case studies dor the purpose of testing this hypothesis. What defining features of good governance discourse have been instrumental in the emergence of the politics that surrounds the agenda, and how is the discourse used to expand or limit the democratic possibilities theoretically inherent in good governance strategies and processes? These questions are important because they're designed to bring clarity to the intent of government and the role that the governed play in states where good governance is an increasingly important political issue. Good governance is more than merely a set of prescribed policies and practices. It is an agenda that reflects a specific set of 'neoliberal' ideas, predicated upon generally unarticulated assumptions about the universality of modern administrative practices supported by normative behavioural change. And it appears to privilege specific interests with potentially unjust implications for wider social formations. This assertion pivots on the finding that in various ways good governance discourages the advancement of open politics beyond nominal democratic procedures because it is theoretically grounded on governance principles that are not easily transferred to developing countries with diverging political, cultural and historical experience. Nevertheless, the attempt is underway. Ostensibly it is taking a form that is schooling targeted populations in what is 'good' and 'bad' in the economic interest of the nation. However, these efforts don't appear to be succeeding, at least not in the way the international architects of good governance intended. This thesis finds that this 'mentality' transformation project is clearly informed by Western experience. And this informs the theoretical approach of the thesis. Specifically, a 'governmentality' framework is used, largely because it has been developed out of analyses of rationalities of government in advanced liberal societies, in which the objectives of good governance are firmly grounded. And as this expanding research program has seldom been used to study government in developing countries, this thesis also puts a case for using governmentality tools beyond the boundaries of its modern Western foundations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Good governance</field><field name="subject">discursive agenda</field><field name="subject">corporate administration</field><field name="subject">public administration</field><field name="subject">World's best practice</field><field name="subject">ASEAN 4</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">Phillippines</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060307.141018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism Based on Reintroductions of Threatened Mammals: Achieving Positive Conservation Outcomes</field><field name="creator">King, Narelle Gaye</field><field name="description">Reintroduction programs have often been used to help redress serious declines across species' former ranges, but they suffer from high expense and low success rates. Tourism is one tool that could be used to support such programs, by generating funding for the programs and the local community, and by educating tourists about reintroductions and conservation. However, if tourism is not incorporated successfully into reintroduction programs, it may not provide any advantages and may even harm the reintroduction. There is a need to find ways to ensure efforts to integrate tourism and reintroductions achieve positive conservation outcomes. This is a topic that has been little researched to date. To achieve positive conservation outcomes, the enterprises must have financial sustainability and sustainable mammal populations. This thesis investigates ways to achieve these dual goals. The international literature is reviewed to establish what can be learnt from previous reintroduction attempts to increase the likelihood of reintroductions of mammals being successful. A number of broad measures are established, including starting the enterprises by reintroducing herbivores and early breeders, preferably wild caught, and then moving to carnivores or omnivores and captive-bred animals when staff have more experience. Some new ideas are developed for experimental releases that will add to the available knowledge on how to increase the chance of successful reintroductions. Tourism enterprises based on reintroductions of threatened native mammals in Australia and South Africa are reviewed. The review shows tourism enterprises based on reintroductions make significant contributions to conservation, but enterprises in Australia need to diversify further. It also describes a number of significant obstacles that enterprises in Australia and South Africa face in achieving financial sustainability and sustainable mammal populations. It then provides recommendations for dealing with the problems, such as employing staff or consultants with knowledge of wildlife management and marketing, and allowing tourists to view wildlife only on guided tours. Finally, the review identifies ways that government bodies in Australia could better facilitate enterprises based on reintroductions, such as making endangered species available free of charge or heavily subsidised at this stage, and then later running wildlife auctions. Legislation systems applying to tourism enterprises based on mammal reintroductions in Australia and South Africa are also reviewed. The review identifies a number of shortcomings of the current Australian legislation that affects the ability of government bodies to facilitate the development of such enterprises. Certain changes to the legislation are suggested. The international literature on factors influencing tourist satisfaction is reviewed and field research at an Australian case study site described, to determine ways tourism enterprises based on reintroductions can maximise tourist satisfaction. The field research draws out a number of new lessons for satisfying tourists, including: placing supplementary food or building waterholes in grasslands and areas with sparse vegetation; providing supplementary food for some species of wildlife; and providing pamphlets with information on the wildlife. The field research also illustrates some new ideas for tests to determine which methods should be used to maximise tourist satisfaction at a specific site, such as testing whether it is better to run tours in vehicles or on foot. The published international literature on minimising impacts of tourism on wildlife is reviewed and field research at one Australian case study site and one Chinese case study site described, to determine how to minimise the negative impacts of tourists on wildlife. The field research illustrates some new ideas for tests to determine which techniques should be used to minimise the impacts of tourism on wildlife at a specific site, such as tests to determine whether it is necessary to ensure tourists remain on the path at all times. The thesis then brings all these elements together into a flow chart giving recommendations to increase the rate of success of tourism enterprises that reintroduce mammals in achieving financial sustainability and sustainable mammal populations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecotourism</field><field name="subject">threatened native species</field><field name="subject">tourist satisfaction</field><field name="subject">impacts of tourism on wildlife</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070212.113043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Structure and Population Genetic Variation in a Eucalypt Species Complex</field><field name="creator">King, Rachel</field><field name="description">In this study, the relative influences of selection, gene flow, and other evolutionary forces on the spatial structure of genetic variation within a eucalypt species complex (the spotted gums: genus Corymbia, section Politaria) were assessed. The study investigated the spatial genetic structure among four putative species of spotted gum (broad-scale), as well as within a single population (fine-scale)of one species, using both molecular and quantitative markers. The spotted gum complex occurs naturally across a range of 2500 km in eastern Australia. Spatial genetic variation within and between the four putative spotted gum species was examined using both chloroplast and nuclear markers. No significant differentiation was found between the three northern species of the complex, C. citriodora, C. variegata and C. henryi. The southern species, C. maculata, shared no haplotypes with any of the three northern species. These results disagree in part with those reported in a previous allozyme based study in which C. henryi was found to be significantly divergent from C. variegata (with which it is sympatric) and more closely aligned with C. maculata. Re-analysis of the allozyme data provided evidence of selection acting at the PGM2 locus within populations of C. variegata and C. henryi. The exclusion of this locus from the data set led to concordance between the cpDNA and nDNA analyses. Restricted gene flow and evidence of isolation by distance were identified as the dominant processes influencing the contemporary distribution of the cpDNA haplotypes. No geographic structure of haplotypes was found and complex genealogical relationships between haplotypes indicated the combined effects of past fragmentation, range expansion and possible long distance dispersal events. The variation and spatial structure in both neutral molecular markers and quantitative genetic traits were compared to explore the relative influences of dispersal and selection within a single eucalypt population. Both mature trees (n=130) from a natural population of C. variegata and their progeny (n=127) were sampled. A very high outcrossing rate (98%) was estimated for the population based on data from seven microsatellite loci. This suggested regular pollen&#150;mediated gene flow into the population, further supported by the observed high levels of genetic diversity and polymorphism. Significant positive spatial structure was found between parent trees occurring up to 150 m apart in the natural forest, although genetic distance between these individuals suggested limited relatedness (i.e. less than half-sib relatedness). The effect of pollen-mediated gene flow appears, therefore, to swamp any effect of nearest neighbour inbreeding which has been reported in other studies of eucalypt populations and has been attributed to limited seed dispersal. Resistance to the fungal disease Sporothrix pitereka (Ramularia Shoot Blight) was measured on progeny from each of the population study trees. Substantial resistance variability was found, along with a high estimate in heritability of resistance (0.44 &#177; 0.06), indicating significant additive genetic variation within the population. Spatial analysis showed no significant spatial structure with resistant and susceptible genotypes apparently distributed randomly throughout the population. The lack of concordance between the molecular and quantitative markers suggests that there may be a cost to resistance. Temporal variation in the severity of disease outbreaks may have then led to differential selection of seedlings across many generations, maintaining variability in disease resistance and facilitating the apparent random distribution of disease resistant and susceptible genotypes throughout the population. C. variegata is an important commercial forestry species. The identification of strong genetic control in the disease resistance trait, as well as significant adverse genetic and phenotypic correlations between susceptibility and growth traits, will aid future breeding programs. Controlled crosses between resistant genotypes from this population should result in strong genetic gains in both resistance and growth, with little costs associated with inbreeding depression due to the highly outcrossed nature of the population.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eucalypt</field><field name="subject">eucalypts</field><field name="subject">eucalyptus</field><field name="subject">spotted gum</field><field name="subject">Corymbia</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050113.091713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescent Music Development and the Influence of Pre-Tertiary Specialised Music Training</field><field name="creator">Kirchhubel, Julie</field><field name="description">The study explores the music development, achievement and aspirations of adolescent students who participate in pre-tertiary specialised music programs. A theoretical model is developed for the study to investigate the role and influence of such training in the development of music skills, and explores relationships amongst music experience, music engagement, academic achievement, interpersonal and intrapersonal relationships, personal learning styles, and affective response to music.  The data source for the study was the Young Conservatorium program (YCP) at Griffith University. Three sub-studies formed the investigation, two focussing on music development, and one, the program. The first sub-study involved 117 enrolled students, the second, 44 teachers and 112 former students, and the third, 15 case studies. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained using surveys, tasks, tests, interviews, discussions, reflective journals, and practice logs.  A large body of literature has identified a continued need for research that traces the music development of young musicians in adolescence, research that utilises both large and small sampling (particularly case studies), and is conducted at the time of training. The present study was conducted over two years, utilised a larger population than many previous studies, involved case studies, and combined contemporaneous and retrospective approaches. Research findings contribute to knowledge regarding young musicians' music training and learning in pre-tertiary specialised music programs, and the nature of pre-tertiary specialised music programs themselves: their rationale, methods of instruction, and overall effectiveness. They highlight the types of music programs and music training provisions available to young Australian musicians, and, though showing students to frequently engage in multiple music learning environments, confirm the need for individuals demonstrating above-average music ability to access specialised music tuition and opportunities, develop in a supportive learning environment, and interact with students of similar interests and abilities. Although also suggesting there to be a number of factors associated with pre-tertiary specialised music training that can deter some students, such factors tend to be non-musical in nature. In all, the study does show a trend for the families of young, above-average musicians to choose to provide for their children access to pre-tertiary specialised training, and for participants to gain from this experience.  The study seeks to enhance understanding of the conditions though which music development is nurtured; it confirms the importance of exposure and opportunity, the collective efforts of the family and community, and the need for hard work and perseverance to usually be exercised by young musicians themselves. Common trends associated with the music development of young, above-average musicians pertained to music training and influences, characteristics, goals, and achievement. Early music exposure, guidance, and positive music experiences were found to be conducive to music learning. The establishment of a practice routine, increasing engagement with music, the formation of broad music preferences, demonstration of high music aptitude, musical and academic achievement, and goal-setting all characterised the experiences and marked the qualities of students sustaining their music interests in adolescence. Interpersonal support and developing intrapersonal attributes, personal learning styles and increasing affective response to music, together with developing cognitive and metacognitive skills, were generally shown to typify the music development of young, above-average musicians in adolescence.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music education</field><field name="subject">music training</field><field name="subject">music ability</field><field name="subject">music aptitude</field><field name="subject">musical</field><field name="subject">adolescent</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">teenage</field><field name="subject">teenagers</field><field name="subject">Griffith University</field><field name="subject">Young Conservatorium Program</field><field name="subject">learning style</field><field name="subject">learning styles</field><field name="subject">interpersonal relationships</field><field name="subject">academic achievement</field><field name="subject">academic ability</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040427.122927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Self-Starting Vertical Axis Wind Turbines for Stand-Alone Applications</field><field name="creator">Kirke, Brian Kinloch</field><field name="description">There is an urgent need for economical, clean, sustainable energy supplies, not only in densely populated areas where electricity grids are appropriate, but also in rural areas where stand-alone power supply systems are often more suitable. Although electrical power supply is very versatile and convenient, it introduces unnecessary complexity for some off-grid applications where direct mechanical shaft power can conveniently be provided by a wind turbine. Wind energy is one of the more promising renewable energy sources. Most wind turbines are of the horizontal axis type, but vertical axis wind turbines or VAWTs have some advantages for direct mechanical drive applications. They need no tail or yaw mechanism to orient them into the wind and power is easily transmitted via a vertical shaft to a load at ground level. Blades may be of uniform section and untwisted, making them relatively easy to fabricate or extrude, unlike the blades of horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) which should be twisted and tapered for optimum performance. Savonius rotor VAWTs are simple and may have a place where the power requirement is only a few Watts, but they are inefficient and uneconomical for applications with larger power requirements. VAWTs based on the Darrieus rotor principle are potentially more efficient and more economical, but those with fixed pitch blades have hitherto been regarded as unsuitable for stand-alone use due to their lack of starting torque and low speed torque. This starting torque problem can be overcome by using variable pitch blades, but most existing variable pitch VAWTs, variously known as giromills or cycloturbines, need wind direction sensors, microprocessors and servomotors to control the blade pitch, making them impracticable for stand-alone, non-electrical applications. A simpler but less well known concept is passive or self-acting variable pitch in which the blades are free to pitch under the combined action of aerodynamic and inertial forces in such a way that a favourable blade angle of attack is maintained without the complexity of conventional variable pitch systems. Several fonns of self-acting variable pitch VAWTs or SAPVAWTs have been described in the literature, several patents exist for variants on the concept, and at least two companies world-wide have attempted to commercialise their designs. However the aerodynamic behaviour of these devices has been little understood and most designs appear to have been based on nothing more than a qualitative appreciation of the potential advantages of the concept. This thesis assesses the potential of both fixed and passive variable pitch vertical axis wind turbines to provide economical stand-alone power for direct mechanical drive applications. It is shown that the starting torque and low speed torque problems of VAWTs can be overcome either by passive variable pitch or by a combination of suitable blade aerofoil sections, either rigid or flexible, and transmissions which unload the rotor at low speeds so that high starting torque is not necessary. The work done for this thesis is made up of a sequence of stages, each following logically from the previous one: 1. Several tasks have been identified which could be performed effectively by a self-starting vertical axis wind turbine using direct mechanical drive. These include, a. pumping water, b. purifying and/or desalinating water by reverse osmosis, c. heating and cooling using vapour compression heat pumps, d. mixing and aerating water bodies and e. heating water by fluid turbulence. Thus it is apparent that such a system has the potential to make a useful contribution to society. 2. A literature survey of existing VAWT designs has been carried out to assess whether any are suitable for these applications. 3. As no suitable existing design was identified, an improved form of SAPVAWT has been developed and patented. 4. To optimise the performance of the improved SAPVAWT, a mathematical model has been developed in collaboration with Mr Leo Lazauskas of the University of Adelaide (see Kirke and Lazauskas, 1991, Lazauskas and Kirke, 1992). As far as the author of the present thesis is aware, this is the only existing mathematical model able to predict the performance of this particular type of SAPVAWT, and one of only two worldwide which model SAPVAWTs. 5. In order to use the mathematical model to predict the performance of a given SAPVAWT, it is necessary to have lift, drag and moment data for the aerofoil profile to be used, over a wide range of incidence and Reynolds numbers. A literature search has revealed large gaps in the existing data. 6. Wind tunnel testing has been carried out to assess the effect of camber on the performance of one set of NACA sections at low Reynolds number, and performance figures for other sections have been estimated by interpolation from existing data. 7. Using the assembled aerofoil data, both experimental and estimated, the mathematical model has been used to predict the performance of both fixed and variable pitch VAWTs. It has been found to predict correctly the performance of known fixed pitch VAWTs and has then been used to predict the performance of fixed pitch VAWTs with cambered blades using newly developed profiles that exhibit superior characteristics at low Reynolds numbers. Results indicate that fixed pitch VAWTs using these blade sections should self-start reliably. 8. To validate the mathematical model predictions for self-acting variable pitch, a two metre diameter physical model has been built and tested in a wind tunnel, and acceptable agreement has been obtained between predicted and measured performance. 9. To demonstrate the performance of a SAP VA WT under field conditions, a six metre diameter turbine has been designed, fabricated, erected and tested. 10. Because a prime mover such as a wind turbine is of no use unless it drives a toad, particular attention has been paid to the behaviour of complete systems, including the wind turbine, the transmission and the load. It is concluded that VAWTs with the improved self-starting and low speed torque characteristics described in this thesis have considerable potential in stand-alone, direct mechanical drive applications.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable energy supplies</field><field name="subject">wind energy</field><field name="subject">savonius rotor</field><field name="subject">vertical axis wind turbines</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050916.120408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-Determination Theory and the Theory of Planned Behaviour Applied to Substance Abuse Treatment in a Therapeutic Community Setting</field><field name="creator">Klag, Stefanie</field><field name="description">In the 21st century drug and alcohol abuse presents one of the most serious problems worldwide. Of particular concern is the strong relationship between drug use and crime. While law enforcement strategies, including incarceration, have been revealed to contribute little to break the vicious cycle of drug use and crime, substance abuse treatment has been shown to represent an effective form of intervention. Substantial research on the effectiveness of drug treatment has demonstrated the importance of motivation in predicting treatment retention and success. However, substance users are frequently coerced into therapy by external sources, including the criminal justice system, therefore, typically exhibiting little motivation to enter and remain in treatment long enough to overcome their substance addiction. Although past research investigating the effects of treatment-entry coercion indicates positive treatment results, the vast majority of these studies are seriously impeded by extensive conceptual and methodological problems, questioning the postulated value of coercion in substance abuse treatment. Following the call for a shift in the methodological focus of future studies made by some researchers, the author of the present study tested three models that were based on well-established theories. The first model was based on Self Determination Theory (SDT), a motivational theory, while the second model was based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), an expectancy-value theory. The third model consisted of a combination of the two theories, which was argued to provide a more complete and comprehensive model than each theory on its own. The testing of the models allowed the exploration of the dynamic interplay and relationships between a number of variables including perceptions of coercion, motivation, perceived autonomy support, and behavioural intentions in an effort to explain and predict retention and treatment outcomes amongst drug and alcohol abusers. The study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 involved the development of a 29-item instrument called the Perceived Coercion Questionnaire, which was designed to assess participants' perceptions of coercion to enter drug and alcohol treatment originating from six different sources. The scale was shown to be a valid and reliable measure of the coercion construct. Phase 2 involved the testing of the three models longitudinally by using a sample of 350 substance abusers from six therapeutic communities across Australia. Participants were asked to complete a battery of standardised measures within the first two weeks of treatment admission (Time 1), two months into treatment (Time 2), and at completion of the treatment program (Time 3). The models were tested cross-sectionally and longitudinally employing hierarchical multiple regression analysis. In addition, change scores were calculated to test whether changes in predictor variables would predict outcomes and changes in outcomes cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Analyses of Time 1 and Time 2 cross-sectional data revealed that the SDT model, compared to the TPB and the combined model, provided a better and more parsimonious account of the factors that influence outcomes in therapeutic community treatment. Given the complexity of the study, it was decided to resume the analysis by focusing on the investigation of the SDT model alone. To highlight some of the most important findings, results demonstrated that motivation was a key factor in the treatment and rehabilitation of substance users. As anticipated, intrinsic motivation was consistently predictive of retention and more positive treatment outcomes, while external motivation and amotivation were associated with more negative outcomes. Results also revealed that clients who entered treatment as the result of a legal mandate experienced substantially higher levels of legal coercion compared to clients who entered treatment voluntarily. Legal coercion, in turn, was found to exert a negative impact on substance users' motivation for treatment, thereby indirectly resulting in more negative treatment outcomes. In contrast, self coercion (i.e., feelings of pain and suffering) and health-related pressures seemed to facilitate the development of a more intrinsic motivational attitude towards treatment. Besides, perceptions of competence and control in relation to the therapeutic regime emerged as consistent and important predictors of motivation and treatment outcomes. Finally, findings suggested that treatment staff who employed more autonomous and non-coercive strategies that guided substance users through the change process directly influenced individuals' treatment motivation and thereby facilitated more positive treatment outcomes.  In sum, findings provided support for the usefulness of the SDT model in predicting dropout as well as processes and outcomes in therapeutic community drug and alcohol treatment. Implications for residential substance abuse treatment were discussed, as well as the strengths and limitations of the study. The discussion concludes with implications for practice and suggestions for future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Self-determination theory</field><field name="subject">substance abuse treatment</field><field name="subject">drug abuse</field><field name="subject">alcohol abuse</field><field name="subject">motivational theory</field><field name="subject">Theory of Planned Behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070112.144521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models for Implementing Technology Education in Queensland Primary Schools</field><field name="creator">Knopke, Vicki</field><field name="description">This study examines models for the introduction of technological literacy in technology education in primary schools in Queensland. The study focused on the use of a model derived from one by Morgan (1994a) called The Practitioner's Model of Technological Literacy. The study also examined the development and implementation of a teacher inservice package and student resource material which primary school teachers could utilise to implement a technology based teaching curriculum in their classrooms. Morgan's Practitioner's Model of Technological Literacy was conceptualised through a number of principals listed as: Technical, conceptual, personal, and social. These are defined in the following manner for each dimension. Technical; is comprised of technical capability and proficiency, the utilisation of technology (or design) process, and being at ease with established and emerging technologies. The conceptual dimension is defined as an understanding of the nature of technology, its diversity of meanings and applications in our society; understanding how things work and how solutions can be generated as well as the capacity to judge the adequacy of propositions and solutions given an understanding of the developmental nature of technology. The social aspect of the model encompasses a sensitivity to the dependency of society upon technological solutions and an awareness of the influence of technology upon a democratic society. Finally the personal dimension is bounded by a critical capacity to assess the appropriateness of technology in a variety of settings along with a sense of empowerment to innovate, confront and appreciate the value dependent nature of technology in a world view that it integrated against a background of sustainability. (Morgan, June 1994: 8). This study combines the notion of technological literacy with current Education Queensland policies. These include policies on Active and Informed Citizenship and the principles of Effective Learning and Teaching. The case study approach of this thesis examined seven units of technology curriculum (each labeled at site) and how the units of work were implemented. It detailed the progress made during each unit and allowed for student and parent feedback to triangulate data that was collected. The methodology enabled multiple data gathering techniques to be employed during the study. Many interactions between students and teachers, teacher and class and researcher as participant observer were captured in each site at some time during the course of the study. The confirmation of practice occurred through the data triangulation between researcher and teacher, researcher and students and researcher and parents. Each facet of the phased study provided a broader and more comprehensive picture than if singular researcher observations had been recorded. The study involved three phases. Each phase of the study provided professional development in technology education for the teachers in the study which was then applied in the writing of technology curriculum teaching units and enacted within the classrooms of each site. The results were analysed according to the methodology outlined. At the outset of this study few teachers had any prior experience in technology education and none had encountered the term technological literacy. The results of the project were positive in that teachers with little or no prior knowledge of technological literacy, the concepts it embodied and the principles which underpinned the model all progressed to varying degrees along a continuum of heightened awareness, The new knowledge gained by the teachers was then actioned into teaching and learning programs that were evaluated. During the technology curriculum teaching units students did produce artefacts as an outcome of the technology education process they had undertaken. A constructivist approach was actively encouraged and this method assisted teachers and students in looking for new and multiple ways of solving design briefs. For the most part teachers were surprised at the high quality of solutions and depth of problem solving and interaction students produced during and after the technology curriculum unit. The study suggests that despite the difficulties of introducing technology education programs in primary schooling, it is possible to do so. The key features for successful implementation would seem to be an understanding of the process for implementing such a curriculum program in a classroom. The teachers confidence to engage in problem solving that may lead to a student engaging in learning activities that are beyond their current knowledge base grew during the study. Being willing to allow students to 'take risks' in order to arrive at alternate solutions. To provide for multiple solutions and be confident in providing guidance. The teachers in each of the sites each noted their changing roles, to be a facilitator of learning rather than the knowledge holder. Constructivist teaching using this model has shown that students alter their approach to learning and become active investigators who seek solutions to real work problems as active participants. Given the recent publication of a Syllabus for Technology 1 to 10 in Queensland, (Queensland School Curriculum Council, August 2001) and the upcoming implementation of the syllabus and support documents in 2003 it is timely that this study should look at methods of promoting an awareness of the principles that informed this document.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technology education</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">models</field><field name="subject">technological literacy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051116.154513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust Linear Prediction Analysis for Low Bit-Rate Speech Coding</field><field name="creator">Koestoer, Nanda Prasetiyo</field><field name="description">Speech coding is a very important area of research in digital signal processing. It is a fundamental element of digital communications and has progressed at a fast pace in parallel to the increase of demands in telecommunication services and capabilities. Most of the speech coders reported in the literature are based on linear prediction (LP) analysis. Code Excited Linear Predictive (CELP) coder is a typical and popular example of this class of coders. This coder performs LP analysis of speech for extracting LP coefficients and employs an analysis-by-synthesis procedure to search a stochastic codebook to compute the excitation signal. The method used for performing LP analysis plays an important role in the design of a CELP coder. The autocorrelation method is conventionally used for LP analysis. Though this works reasonably well for noise-free (clean) speech, its performance goes down when signal is corrupted by noise. Spectral analysis of speech signals in noisy environments is an aspect of speech coding that deserves more attention. This dissertation studies the application of recently proposed robust LP analysis methods for estimating the power spectrum envelope of speech signals. These methods are the moving average, moving maximum and average threshold methods. The proposed methods will be compared to the more commonly used methods of LP analysis, such as the conventional autocorrelation method and the Spectral Envelope Estimation Vocoder (SEEVOC) method. The Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) spectrum calculated from these proposed methods are shown to be more robust. These methods work as well as the conventional methods when the speech signal is clean or has high signal-to-noise ratio. Also, these robust methods give less quantisation distortion than the conventional methods. The application of these robust methods for speech compression using the CELP coder provides better speech quality when compared to the conventional LP analysis methods.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">linear prediction</field><field name="subject">speech coding</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030407.142552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I.C.T. Decision-Making Processes in Self-Managing Secondary Schools</field><field name="creator">Kokay, Christine Margaret</field><field name="description">This study examines decision-making processes involved in the development, integration and management of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in self-managing secondary schools and influences that affect these processes. To obtain an holistic view of ICT decision-making processes, a case study is undertaken of three co-educational, state secondary schools within a regional New Zealand city, thereby establishing a multiple case study. The principal, network manager and three staff nominated by the principal as playing an active role in ICT decision-making processes were interviewed using an open-ended interview. Five frequently cited generic decision-making models, developed by theorists to describe specific features of the decision-making process, are examined to provide a theoretical platform against which the interview data are analysed and interpreted. The study concludes that ICT decision-making in the case study schools is influenced particularly by technical knowledge and understandings. Such decision-making tends to be ad-hoc, isolated from other important influences particularly in relation to teaching and learning issues, and 'bounded' because of limited information, the limitations of existing technology, and the inability of schools to keep abreast of technological changes. Six implications are therefore put forward to inform future ICT decision-making in schools. They are: 1.	Schools should develop a strategic plan that is underpinned with technical planning requirements; 2. Technical advice and professional development should be provided for principals; 3. Principals should consult outside the school environment for technical advice to assist with decisions; 4. The role of the ICT committee should be redefined to include planning and development of ICT; 5.	Principals should ensure that staff receive professional development; and 6. Schools should consider student access and the best way of integrating ICT into teaching and learning. The study highlights the need for schools to develop strategic plans that address teaching and learning issues in the development, integration and management of ICT in self-managing secondary schools. Technical decisions should be made in support of these.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making processes</field><field name="subject">information and communication technology</field><field name="subject">secondary schools (New Zealand)</field><field name="subject">technical knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060802.170325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Empirical Study of the Dynamics of Nominal Interest Rates: Australian and Global Perspectives</field><field name="creator">Kremmer, Michael Leslie</field><field name="description">This study explores the inter relationships between the nominal interest rates of Australia and its principal trading partners. The analysis focus on the short end of the yield curve --specifically, rates of up to one year to maturity. In essence, the study comprises a suite of essays, which together provide an overall understanding of the relevant relationship that is, in both depth and scope, greater than the sum of the individual essays. The inquiry begins with an investigation of the impact of the overnight information content of international interest rates upon the Australian domestic money market.   The results indicate that the strongest information impact on Australian interest rates is from the overnight interest and exchange rates of the United States. This is followed, in the second essay, by an investigation of the relationship between domestically and internationally traded Australian dollar denominated, financial assets. The results indicate that a Euro-Australian dollar inter-bank deposit and Australian bank accepted bills are effectively the same assets. Based on this result the third essay investigates the extent to which the short-term nominal interest rates of Australia, the United  Kingdom, the United States and Japan are consistent with the expectations theory of the interest rate term structure. The results indicate that nominal inter-bank deposit rates in all four currencies are broadly consistent with the expectations theory. In addition, two common stochastic trends are identified, which can be associated with the markets of the United States and Japan. The forth essay focuses on the bilateral  relationships between the nominal interest rates of Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan, and aims at establishing the extent to which the observed data is consistent with interest rate parity conditions. It was found that, in the long run, and with some exceptions, there is strong support for all three of the usual parity conditions. These relationships are interpreted as a measure of the efficiency with which the interest rates are simultaneously determined across the four markets. The final essay brings together insights gained in the preceeding essays to help analysis the interactions between each of the four markets at each of the four maturities selected within the consistent framework of a single model. The results indicate that the system can be usefully conceptualised as interactions between two sub-systems. The first sub-system models the nexus between Australia and the United States, and the second sub-system, that between the United Kingdom and Japan. The interactions within and between these two sub-systems are found to change as the maturity increases. At the shortest maturity, Australian interest rates are directly affected by both sub-systems. In contrast, at the longest maturity, Australian interest rates anticipate those of the United States and are not directly affected by the second sub-system.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nominal interest rates</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">United Kingdom</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">Australian domestic money market</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051102.151052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Proteins from Grevillea robusta and NMR Studies of the Serine Protease Inhibitor</field><field name="creator">Kruger, Sarah Jane</field><field name="description">Proteins that recognise the sugar surface structures on cells have an enormous potential to be used as tools in the characterisation of these structures.  A group of proteins, called lectins, have been identified that can bind to carbohydrate complexes on the receptors of cells.  The crude extract from Grevillea robusta seeds was found to contain lectin-like proteins that were different from most other lectins, as they would specifically target the receptors of white blood cells and not those found on red blood cells.  Therefore, the lectin isolated from G.robusta could be used as a tool to identify the specific surface structures on white blood cells.   The lectin was isolated using affinity chromatography where a complex (oligosaccharide) matrix was used.  Agglutination, binding and sugar inhibition assays confirmed the isolated protein was a lectin.  The lectin was found in low amounts (up to 5% of the total protein content) within the seeds of G.robusta.  As a result of this low yield, the identification of the lectin by PAGE was difficult because the levels of protein were beyond the detection limit of the commercial staining reagents.  The lectin was called the GR2 protein and was characterised as a monocot mannose binding lectin based on its sugar specificity for only mannose.   A serine protease inhibitor was isolated from the seeds of G.robusta using two different chromatography methods, reverse phase HPLC (GR1.HPLC) and gel filtration chromatography (GR1.GF).  Ion exchange chromatography was used to initially separate the proteins in the crude extract and the fraction containing the GR1 protein was further purified using reverse phase HPLC (GR1.HPLC).  N-terminal sequencing results of the GR1.HPLC protein, showed evidence of proteolytic cleavage during the extraction process, which lead to the second purification method being established.  Protease inhibitors were added to the buffers prior to being purified by gel filtration chromatography, which resulted in the GR1 protein being isolated from the crude extract without the presence of the contaminating protein.  Mass spectroscopy identified the molecular weight of the GR1 protein to be 6669Da and the full amino acid sequence was derived by cDNA techniques.  Sequence alignment studies of the GR1 protein showed significant similarities with the Bowman-Birk inhibitor.  The positioning of the cysteine residues were conserved throughout the Bowman-Birk superfamily, however these residues were not conserved within the GR1 protein.  Competitive inhibition assays on the GR1 protein revealed the protein could inhibit both trypsin and chymotrypsin at similar levels to that seen for the Bowman-Birk inhibitor.  Therefore, the GR1 protein was characterised as a member of the Bowman-Birk superfamily of serine protease inhibitors.  The three-dimensional structure of the GR1 protein was determined using two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy.  Computer programs such as XEASY, DYANA and SYBYL&#174; were used to tabulate the information taken from the 2D experiments, generate structures and minimise these structures respectively.  The solution structure of the GR1 protein was found to contain a region of antiparallel &#946;-sheet structure that corresponded to the trypsin binding site and the remainder of the protein consisted of loops and turns that were held together by disulfide bridges (the chymotrypsin-binding region).  Structural similarities between the GR1 protein and the Bowman-Birk inhibitor existed only in the trypsin-binding site of the Bowman-Birk inhibitor.  The GR1 protein is the first member of the Proteaceae family to be characterised as a Bowman-Birk inhibitor.   This thesis outlines the isolation and biochemical characterisation of the two proteins found within Grevillea robusta and also describes the steps involved and results obtained in determining the three-dimensional structure of the GR1 protein.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grevillea robusta</field><field name="subject">silky oak</field><field name="subject">lectin</field><field name="subject">lectins</field><field name="subject">sugar</field><field name="subject">sugars</field><field name="subject">mannose</field><field name="subject">serine protease inhibitor</field><field name="subject">protein chemistry</field><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="subject">mass spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">NMR spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">ion exchange chromatography</field><field name="subject">gel filtration chromatography</field><field name="subject">tree</field><field name="subject">trees</field><field name="subject">Bowman-Birk inhibitor</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040618.150708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outsourcing in the Hotel Industry: A Management Accounting Perpective</field><field name="creator">Lamminmaki, Dawne</field><field name="description">The broad objective of this thesis is to develop an understanding of factors affecting outsourcing in the hotel industry and also the role played by management accounting in hotel outsourcing. The thesis draws on transaction cost economics (TCE), agency, contingency, and labour process theories in the context of appraising factors motivating outsourcing. Two empirical phases have been undertaken in the study. The first phase involved a series of interviews with general managers and financial controllers in large South East Queensland hotels. The second phase involved two distinct questionnaire surveys of large Australian hotels. The first was administered to hotel general managers, and the second was administered to hotel financial controllers. Significant findings arising from the study include: 1. In light of the substantial international literature describing hotel outsourcing, it appears that outsourcing in Australian hotels is relatively limited. This appears to be particularly the case with respect to food and beverage related activities. 2. Mixed support is offered for the TCE model. Both the survey and interview data provide some support for TCE's prescription that frequently conducted activities will not tend to be outsourced. Two specific extensions are offered to this aspect of the model, however. Firstly, where activities are conducted to a minimal extent, it can be uneconomic to outsource. Secondly, where large activities are undertaken by a group of organisations, their enhanced purchasing power can result in inexpensive outsourcing arrangements. With respect to TCE's uncertainty proposition, support is offered for the view that the propensity to outsource will be greater where behavioural uncertainty is lower. No support has been offered with respect to environmental uncertainty. The interview data provides some support for TCE's asset specificity proposition, however, minimal support was found in the survey phase. Despite this, the many dimensions of asset specificity (eg. site specificity, human asset specificity, etc) provided a useful checklist of issues to be considered in relation to the outsourcing decision. 3. Negligible support was found for labour process theory (LPT) in the interview phase of the study. In light of this, and the need to narrow the study&#146;s focus in the survey phase, LPT was not pursued further. LPT is a difficult construct to operationalise, given the social desirability error that may result. This may partially account for the absence of significant LPT findings in the interview phase. 4. The survey data provides some support for the agency theory view that risky activities will tend to be outsourced. 5. Considerable cross-hotel variation exists in management of, and accounting's involvement in, outsourcing decision making and control systems. Accounting appraisal of outsourcing proposals rarely includes long term oriented, sophisticated techniques such as "net present value". It appears this may be because outsourcing decisions are not conducted in the context of the formal capital budgeting process. 6. High performing hotels and hotels that conduct their outsourcing decisions in the context of a long term outsourcing strategic agenda have more sophisticated outsourcing management systems.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">outsourcing</field><field name="subject">hotel</field><field name="subject">hotels</field><field name="subject">hospitality</field><field name="subject">industry</field><field name="subject">accounting</field><field name="subject">management accounting</field><field name="subject">managerial accounting</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Southeast Queensland</field><field name="subject">transaction cost economics</field><field name="subject">TCE</field><field name="subject">agency</field><field name="subject">contingency</field><field name="subject">labour process theory</field><field name="subject">LPT</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040920.091600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conditional Truths: Remapping Paths To Documentary 'Independence'</field><field name="creator">Lang, Ian William</field><field name="description">(Synopsis to introductory statement): An introductory statement to five documentary films made by Ian Lang in Australia between 1981 and 1997 exemplifying &#160;a 'democratising' model of  sustainable and ethical documentary film production.

Conduct problems develop early in an individual's life and can lead to more serious problems including substance abuse and delinquency in adolescence and adulthood. Given the high incidence of conduct problems in children, the need for prevention and early intervention strategies to target the onset and development of this phenomenon is paramount. This thesis focuses on early intervention strategies for reducing the incidence of conduct problems in children and explores a multi-modal early intervention and prevention program targeting children and families at-risk of the development of conduct problems. A randomised controlled trial involving 455 children was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of this program. Participants were drawn from ten Education Queensland primary schools in the Mount Gravatt district of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The 455 children were randomly assigned to either experimental or control conditions for the purposes of the program's evaluation. From this initial cohort, an indicated sample of 1 52 participants was identified through a universal screening process. This sample included children who were considered more at-risk of conduct problems. Participants designated to experimental conditions engaged in the school component of the program, with 66 of the experimental group receiving an additional indicated component facilitated in the school setting. Further, a selection of parents of children in the experimental group participated in the home component of the intervention. The retention rate for families engaged in the study was high with 96% of participants remaining engaged in the study throughout the evaluation process. The findings that emerged from the study revealed significant differences between participants who engaged in the intervention program compared with those designated to control conditions. Positive changes in the behaviour of students reported at the school level were statistically significant. However, while some changes were identified in the home setting, the treatment effects of the program were not significant. These findings were sustained at the six-month follow up period. Conclusions drawn from this study were conceptualised within the framework of current advances in the social science literature that focus on conduct problems and early intervention and prevention. The outcomes of the research emphasise the significance of comprehensive interventions programs for children and families at-risk that focus on both school and home settings and that are easily implemented in, and cost-effective to, community populations. Recommendations from this research serve to inform ftiture research agendas in early intervention and prevention and specialists in the fields of psychology and education.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conduct problems</field><field name="subject">families at risk</field><field name="subject">early intervention strategies</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051111.154414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the Wilderness: Federal Labor in Opposition</field><field name="creator">Lavelle, Ashley</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the federal Australian Labor Party (ALP) in Opposition.  It seeks to identify the various factors that shape the political direction of the party when it is out of office by examining three important periods of Labor Opposition. It is argued in the first period (1967-72) that the main factor in the party&#146;s move to the left was the radicalisation that occurred in Australian (and global) politics.  Labor in Opposition is potentially more subject to influence by extra-parliamentary forces such as trade unions and social movements.  This was true for this period in the case of the reinvigorated trade union movement and the Anti-Vietnam War Movement, whose policy impacts on the ALP under Gough Whitlam are examined in detail.  While every one of the party's policies cannot be attributed to the tumult of the period, it is argued that Labor's Program embodied the mood for social change.  The second period (1975-83) records a much different experience.  After Labor's Dismissal from office in November 1975, the enduring conclusion drawn by the party was that it had failed in government as economic managers, and that in future it would need to embrace responsible economic management and to jettison programmatic-style reform.  This conclusion was accepted and argued by both federal leaders during this time, Gough Whitlam (1975-77) and Bill Hayden (1977-83). The thesis argues that the key reason for Labor's abandonment of reformist politics was the dramatic shift in the economic context wrought by the collapse of the post-war boom in 1974, which undermined the economic basis of the Program.  The degree to which 'economic responsibility' governed Labor's approach to policy-making is highlighted through case studies of uranium mining and the Prices-Incomes Accord.  The final period of Opposition (1996-2001) commences with the party&#146;s landslide defeat at the 1996 Federal Election.  Under the leadership of Kim Beazley, the party continued in the pro-free market policy tradition of Labor Prime Ministers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating.   In conjunction with this, it employed a 'small-target' strategy that pitched its electoral success on community anger towards the government, rather than any alternative policies of the Opposition.  The free-market policy continuity is set in the context of the ideological effects of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Bloc, in the aftermath of which all political players accepted that there was no real alternative to the market.  Furthermore, the overall state of the Australian and world economies was not conducive to a return to 'tax and spend' policies.  The party&#146;s bipartisanship on globalisation and economic rationalism effectively robbed it of an alternative political approach to that of the Coalition.  Thus, in a sense it was hemmed into the 'small-target' strategy.   The thesis concludes by comparing and contrasting the three periods, and assigning weight to the various factors that shape Labor in Opposition.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Labor Party</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Federal politics</field><field name="subject">Whitlam</field><field name="subject">Hayden</field><field name="subject">Hawke</field><field name="subject">Keating</field><field name="subject">Beazley</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">Opposition</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040226.151930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiential Education as a Best Practice Pedagogy for Environmental Education in Teacher Education</field><field name="creator">Law, Barry Alan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the potential of experiential education as a 'best practice' pedagogy for pre-service teacher education in environmental education. The study involves forty pre-service teachers working collaboratively with the researcher in 1998 to test the assumptions of two previous groups of beginning teachers (1996 and 1997) who indicated in their course evaluations that experiential education may provide an effective teaching and learning approach for environmental education. This study combines two approaches to participative inquiry: action inquiry and cooperative inquiry. Both research approaches promote reflection-in-action and involve groups of individuals working collaboratively together as reflective practitioners. The data sources included reflective journals, a researcher diary, pre and post course questionnaires, individual interviews and group interviews. The environmental education course is a single case study and reflects the experience of three groups of students. The first group completed a 20 hour course in experiential education before starting the environmental education course, the second group completed both courses concurrently, while the third group only completed the environmental education course. The purpose of the literature review in experiential education and environmental education in teacher education is to provide a rationale for using a transformative teaching and learning approach in pre-service teacher education for environmental education. Contemporary best practice pedagogical approaches for environmental education are supported by many of the core principles of experiential education highlighting compatibility between theory and practice. The findings show that a transformative teaching and learning approach in environmental education was achieved by combining four key characteristics of experiential education in a holistic process. The four characteristics included reflection, connection to personal experience, emotionally engaged learning and student-centred teaching and learning. The impact of combining these four characteristics resulted in higher interest, motivation and enthusiasm for achieving the social action outcomes of environmental education. Thus, the pre-service teachers confirmed a synergy emerged between the outcomes of environmental education and the pedagogical process of experiential education. The experiential approach allowed the pre-service teachers to engage in the role of the critical reflective practitioner. Consequently, the pre-service teachers were able to identify the potential and possibilities for implementing experiential education strategies in environmental education and also recognise and challenge the barriers that confine and constrain its use in teacher education and formal schooling. As a consequence the pre-service teachers identified that working in collaborative groups of reflective practitioners was essential to continue developing effective facilitation skills and also to help them challenge traditional practice that limited their professional development. They also identified significant changes to the pre-service environmental education course to ensure a higher quality experience for subsequent groups of beginning teachers. The study highlights the need for more research into how well beginning teacher implementing environmental education function as reflective practitioners in their first few years in teaching and are able to challenge the barriers that limit transformative pedagogical approaches in schools.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="subject">teacher education</field><field name="subject">teacher training</field><field name="subject">experiential education</field><field name="subject">action learning</field><field name="subject">action inquiry</field><field name="subject">cooperative inquiry</field><field name="subject">student-centred teaching</field><field name="subject">student-centred learning</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031117.090529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Program Transformation for Proving Database Transaction Safety</field><field name="creator">Lawley, Michael John</field><field name="description">In this thesis we propose the use of Dijkstra's concept of a predicate transformer [Dij75] for the determination of database transaction safety [SS89] and the generation of simple conditions to check that a transaction will not violate the integrity constraints in the case that it is not safe. The generation of this simple condition is something that can be done statically, thus providing a mechanism for generating safe transactions. Our approach treats a database as state, a database transaction as a program, and the database's integrity constraints as a postcondition in order to use a predicate transformer [Dij75] to generate a weakest precondition. We begin by introducing a set-oriented update language for relational databases for which a predicate transformer is then defined. Subsequently, we introduce a more powerful update language for deductive databases and define a new predicate transformer to deal with this language and the more powerful integrity constraints that can be expressed using recursive rules. Next we introduce a data model with object-oriented features including methods, inheritance and dynamic overriding. We then extend the predicate transformer to handle these new features. For each of the predicate transformers, we prove that they do indeed generate a weakest precondition for a transaction and the database integrity constraints. However, the weakest precondition generated by a predicate transformer still involves much redundant checking. For several general classes of integrity constraint, including referential integrity and functional dependencies, we prove that the weakest precondition can be substantially further simplified to avoid checking things we already know to be true under the assumption that the database currently satisfies its integrity con-straints. In addition, we propose the use of the predicate transformer in combination with meta-rules that capture the exact incremental change to the database of a particular transaction. This provides a more general approach to generating simple checks for enforcing transaction safety. We show that this approach is superior to known existing previous approaches to the problem of efficient integrity constraint checking and transaction safety for relational, deductive, and deductive object-oriented databases. Finally we demonstrate several further applications of the predicate transformer to the problems of schema constraints, dynamic integrity constraints, and determining the correctness of methods for view updates. We also show how to support transactions embedded in procedural languages such as C.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Database transaction safety</field><field name="subject">database management</field><field name="subject">predicate calculus</field><field name="subject">programming languages</field><field name="subject">logic (symbolic and mathematical)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070228.150125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning as Participation in Grains Research, Development and Extension in Australia</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, David Norman</field><field name="description">This thesis is grounded in the introduction of participatory research, development and extension (RDE) to Australian agriculture. The emphasis on participatory processes emerged as the Transfer-of-Technology (ToT) model is no longer considered adequate to deal with complex farming systems and their diverse stakeholders (Packham 2003). However, RDE agencies are introducing participatory processes with a limited understanding of how they may work in Australia's developed agriculture sector (Vanclay 1994). Consequently, the initiation of three participatory Farming Systems RDE projects in Australia's northern grains region provides opportunity to explore and understand participatory approaches and their impact on participants. Three related themes are developed by exploring the nature of participants' diversity across these projects, the characteristics of participation in each project and the subsequent learning of participants: (i) that increased participation implicitly increases diversity in the conduct of RDE; (ii) that participatory RDE provides opportunities to integrate stakeholders' diverse experience and knowledge; and (iii) that participants' learning can improve current farming systems. Participatory action research was used to understand how participatory RDE should be enacted, and to involve project participants to help them also understand and improve their project processes and goals. The research utilised a range of qualitative and quantitative procedures including: participant and nonparticipant observation at project meetings and activities with farmers; focus groups and semi-structured interviews with project teams, their managers, and participating farmers; a team learning survey of team members; and custom-made questionnaires to quantify participants' perceptions of the projects, their processes, and impacts on learning and behaviour.  These interventions identified participants' demographic, organisational and informational diversity. They also identified and elaborated their diverse aims, expectations and passions for participatory RDE, revealed individuals' preferred RDE methodologies and suggested their underlying worldviews. Indeed, ToT paradigms and positivist worldviews remained entrenched in most project staff and their managers.  The teams consequently used participation to help farmers better understand technical issues, not build interdependent projects with integrated RDE processes. Farmers generally appreciated their increased participation and influence in RDE activities. While their initial consultative and functional participation did not extend to process decisions or project strategy, farmers valued the opportunity to work with the projects and influence the issues addressed. The projects consequently improved farming practices and management of issues that have long-eluded traditional RDE. For example, the widespread use of: (i) zero tillage and controlled traffic systems to control soil erosion; (ii) nitrogen fertilisers to match crop requirements; (iii) ley pastures to address soil fertility in grain and grazing systems; and (iv) new crops to diversifying grain systems away from monocultures. The projects provided farmers with opportunities for increased participation and learning over time. Functional participation developed in on-farm research that addressed issues identified with farmers, and action learning workshops provided proximal opportunities for farmers to understand existing information and use their own farm data in real decisions. In this way, the behaviourist learning of the ToT approach was supplemented by guided learning to integrate new meaning schemes with farmers' experiential knowledge. Some on-farm research and action learning activities extended to reflecting on their processes, and involved farmers in deciding the most appropriate RDE methodology and methods for subsequent activities. This opportunity to reflect on the values and assumptions of different approaches was critical in developing interactive participation and higher level learning for participants. Nevertheless, the initial participation in each project team failed to meet some team members' expectations. The expected task and process conflicts emerged, but small activity groups with shared values and RDE paradigms developed within each team. Team members' process conflict about the 'best' RDE methodologies for specific issues then developed into worldview conflicts about the relevance and rigour of these methodologies. Some smaller groups subsequently worked independently, with damaging relationship conflict developing from unresolved process issues between some individuals. Team members communicated, but their participation remained largely passive and consultative. Factors that shaped participation were identified, and a framework to support opportunities for stakeholders to plan, manage and evaluate RDE was developed. These helped increase participation in the projects. Participation within the projects' constituent activities subsequently fluxed from isolation to interactive participation. Individuals within activities now expected, and usually had, equality in content decisions (i.e. functional participation), which often extended to process decisions (i.e. interactive participation). Yet, the levels of participation between members of different activities varied across the projects. One project remained a series of parallel and relatively independent activities with passive and consultative participation. A second project had functional and interactive participation imposed for some activities, but otherwise used passive and consultative participation. The third project developed to provide functional and interactive participation in major project decisions. It then became apparent that the learning outcomes of each project varied. Individuals continued to learn from their participation in the projects, but the contributions of diverse sources and participation were major shapers of this learning. Participation within the less diverse activity groups produced mainly technical learning through participants' existing meaning schemes. Again, the level of participation between activities with diverse values, RDE paradigms, and worldviews, shaped the nature of learning. Passive and consultative participation produced mostly technical learning through existing meaning schemes. Yet, teams that embraced their diversity, and reflected on the assumptions of their different RDE methodologies, transformed their approach to learning. With high levels of diversity, the level of participation determined the level of learning. Essentially, participation became learning. This thesis confirms the potential of participatory RDE to improve farming practices. Consultation to identify priority issues, and functional participation to develop proximal opportunities for farmers to understand these issues and make their own decisions had a major impact on farming practices. Yet, participatory processes must rise above the prevailing ToT paradigms of RDE agencies to integrate participants' knowledge, and so achieve sustainable development in Australia. Three main process contributions are made to support this development. Firstly, the evaluation framework provides a challenge and structure to encourage the contributions of all participants at each stage of project activities. It provides a checklist for effective participation in Farming Systems RDE. Secondly, a typology of participation in Farming Systems RDE extends that proposed by Pretty (1995). It provides a catalyst and means to better understand and identify the most appropriate levels of participation in RDE projects. The associated checklist for assessing modes of participation allows monitoring of the participation developed in practice. Finally, the re-conceptualisation of a broader continuum of participation in Farming Systems RDE for developed agriculture is proposed. The subsequent development of the Doing successful on-farm research process is a culmination of the understandings developed in this thesis. It facilitates the development of interactive participation within the on-farm research process that is central to these projects. Recognising the technical focus of most current RDE agency staff, it guides their development of participatory on-farm research processes before reflecting on the appropriateness of different research methods to their research issues. The findings here cannot ensure the development of Australia's RDE beyond the ToT paradigm. However, this thesis provides important insights into the nature of diversity, participation, and learning in the Farming Systems projects, and a series of tools to support this development. Conceptually, it proposes that different kinds of participation will be shaped by participants' diversity from their prior experiences and their expectations that are in turn transformed through evidence of improved practice.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian agriculture</field><field name="subject">grains research</field><field name="subject">farming research development and extension</field><field name="subject">farming systems projects</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070118.111610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic Properties of Nanostructures from Hydrostatics and Hydrodynamics</field><field name="creator">Le, Hung Manh</field><field name="description">The behaviour of electrons in nanostructures such as quantum wells is of interest for the design of new electronic and electro-optic devices, and also for exploration of basic many-body physics. This thesis develops and tests improved methods for describing such electronic behaviour. The system used for this work was the parabolic quantum well (PQW), an important special system which has recently attracted much experimental and theoretical attention. We firstly report self-consistent nonlinear groundstate solutions of the Poisson equation together with the Thomas-Fermi (TF) hydrostatic equations. In contrast to most previous solutions, all the electron density profiles were inhomogeneous and continuous. We also added a von Weizsacker term with and without the exchange/exchange-correlation to the above treatment, using a novel numerical approach allowing for wider electron gases than previously possible. We also report for the first time the effects of spatially varying effective mass and dielectric function in theories of this type. To investigate infrared response of these systems, we apply new hydrodynamic theories recently proposed by Dobson. By using this type of theory, we simultaneously satisfy the Harmonic Potential Theorem (extended generalized Kohn theorem) and obtain the correct 2D plasmon dispersion, as well as obtaining the correct spacing of standing plasmons. Other inhomogeneous hydrodynamic theories do not achieve this. We also showed analytically an exact solution for a plasmon mode at the Kohn frequency in addition to one found in the Harmonic Potential Theorem. An open hydrodynamic theory was then developed based on this type of mode. Numerical application of Kohn Frequency Theorem theory was shown and the results were compared with other existing hydrodynamic theories.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanostructures</field><field name="subject">quantum wells</field><field name="subject">electronic devices</field><field name="subject">electro-optic devices</field><field name="subject">parabolic quantum well</field><field name="subject">Thomas-Fermi hydrostatic equations</field><field name="subject">harmonic potential theorem</field><field name="subject">Kohn frequency theorem</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070403.094305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of Migraine Candidate Genes and Genomic Susceptibility Regions</field><field name="creator">Lea, Rod A.</field><field name="description">Typical migraine, comprised of migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO), is a chronic, painful and debilitating neurovascular disease which is generally characterised by recurrent attacks of severe headache usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photo and phonophobia.  Migraine has been shown to affect a large proportion of Caucasian populations with a recent comprehensive study indicating that around 25% of women and 8% of men suffer from the disease.  Strong familial aggregation of typical migraine and an increased concordance for the disease in MZ twins over DZ twins, suggests that it has a significant genetic component.  Heritability estimates are calculated to be between 40% and 60%, indicating that disease variation, in part, is explained by environmental determinants.  The mode of transmission of typical migraine is not clear but is most likely multifactorial.  Although the MA and MO subtypes exhibit some clinical heterogeneity, segregation analysis has suggested that there may be a common genetic aetiology for MA and MO, and a major gene contributing to typical migraine pathogenesis.  This idea is substantiated by the fact that both subtypes of migraine can occur within the same family and even within the same individual, with up to 33% of sufferers experiencing both types of the disease.  In addition, migraine prophylactics have been shown to result in similar effects in patients treated for both types of migraine.  However, whether the two subtypes are truly separate entities or not remains unclear.  At present, the type and number of genes involved in typical migraine is not known.  Despite this, several studies into Familial Hemiplegic Migraine (FHM), a very severe subtype of MA, have led to the discovery that mutations in a brain specific calcium channel subunit gene (CACNA1A) located on chromosome 19, cause FHM in about 50% of affected families.  FHM is a rare disease and is distinguished from typical migraine by its association with hemiparesis and clear autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.  However, certain clinical features are common to both FHM and typical migraine including similarities in headache characteristics and triggers.  Hence, FHM genetic studies provide a valuable model for investigating the genes involved in the more prevalent types of migraine with and without aura.  For this reason the Genomics Research Centre has been conducting linkage studies utilising large Australian migraine pedigrees with a focus on the known FHM (CACNA1A) gene region on chromosome 19p13.  Our results to date have indicated suggestive linkage to the FHM region on 19p13 in a large multigenerational pedigree (MF1) affected with typical migraine, with a maximum parametric LOD score of 1.92 (P = 0.001) obtained for a triplet repeat polymorphism situated in exon 47 of the CACNA1A gene.  Expansion of this repeat was not observed, but is possible that mutations elsewhere in the CACNA1A gene may be responsible for migraine in this pedigree.  To investigate this possibility, the current research involved sequencing two patients carrying the critical susceptibility haplotype surrounding the CACNA1A gene.  The results of this mutation screen revealed no disease causing mutations or polymorphisms in any of the 47 exons screened.  To determine whether the CACNA1A genomic region was implicated in typical migraine susceptibility in the general Caucasian population, 82 independent pedigrees and a large case-control group were also analysed using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers.  There was no linkage or association detected in these groups and thus, it was concluded that if CACNA1A plays a role in typical migraine it does not confer a major effect on the disease.  However, subsequent case-control studies of SNPs in the INSR gene, which is located ~15cM telomeric from CACNA1A, provided evidence of association to typical migraine.  Thus, the INSR gene may now emerge as the new migraine susceptibility gene in this genomic region on chromosome 19. Family linkage studies conducted by Gardner et al have implicated an additional FHM susceptibility region on chromsome 1q31.  Furthermore, independent research carried out by Ducros et al. has indicated a second FHM locus at 1q21-23, which is ~ 30cM centromeric to the region reported by Gardner et al.  At this stage it is not clear whether there is a single locus, or two distinct loci, on the chromosome 1q region.  This research also involved a family-based linkage and association approach to investigating the FHM susceptibility region on chromosome 1q31 for involvement in typical migraine susceptibility in affected Australian pedigrees.  Initial multipoint ALLEGRO analysis provided strong evidence for linkage of Chr1q31 markers to typical migraine in a large multigenerational pedigree.  The 1-LOD* unit support interval for suggestive linkage spanned ~18cM with a maximum allele sharing LOD* score of 3.36 obtained for marker D1S2782, P = 0.00004.  Subsequent analysis of an independent sample of 82 affected pedigrees added support to the initial findings with a maximum LOD* of 1.24 (P = 0.008).  Utilising the independent sample of 82 pedigrees we also performed a family-based association test.  Results of this analysis indicated distortion of allele transmission at marker D1S249 (global c2(5) of 15.00, P = 0.010) in these pedigrees. These positive linkage and association results will need further confirmation by independent researchers, but overall they provide good evidence for the existence of a typical migraine locus near these markers on Chr1q31, and reinforce the idea that an FHM gene in this genomic region may also contribute to susceptibility to the more common forms of migraine. The serotonergic system has long been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine.  Researchers have therefore focused on the serotonin receptors and the genes that code for them when investigating this disease.  Although serotonin receptor agonists have proven to be effective in the treatment of migraine, there has been little evidence of a serotonin receptor gene being associated with the disorder.  However, in 1998, Ogilvie et al reported that a VNTR in the serotonin transporter gene (SERT) showed altered allelic distributions in a Danish migraine population.  In addition to serotonin, there has been renewed interest in the involvement of the dopaminergic pathways in migraine.  This interest has gained impetus since the study of Peroutka et al who reported an allelic association between the dopamine receptor gene DRD2 and migraine with aura.  Another dopamine related gene, the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene (DBH), has been localised to Chr 9q34 and codes for the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine.  It therefore plays an important role in dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission.  Serum levels of DbH enzyme have been reported to be elevated in migrainous patients during the headache phase of an attack.  Also, significantly increased DbH enzyme activity has been observed in migraine patients during the headache-free interval.  Thus, the DBH gene is another good candidate for involvement in migraine pathophysiology and, to our knowledge, has not been previously implicated in this disease. Candidate gene studies may be useful strategies for identifying genes involved in complex diseases such as migraine, especially if the gene being examined contributes only a minor effect to the overall phenotype.  This research also involved a linkage and association approach to investigating neurotransmitter related migraine candidate genes.  Specifically, polymorphisms within the serotonin transporter gene (SERT), the dopamine receptor gene (DRD2) and the dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) gene were tested in unrelated Caucasian migraineurs and non-migraine control individuals.  In addition, an independent sample of 82 families affected with migraine were examined.  Unrelated case-control association analysis of a DBH intragenic dinucleotide polymorphism indicated altered allelic distribution between migraine and control groups (c2 = 16.53, P = 0.019).  Furthermore, the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) which was implemented on the family data also indicated distortion of allele transmission for the same DBH marker (c2 = 4.44, P = 0.035).  Together, these results provide evidence for allelic association of the DBH gene with typical migraine susceptibility (Fisher's Combined P-value = 0.006) and indicate that further research into the role of the DBH gene in migraine aetiology is warranted. Nitric oxide (NO) is emerging as a key molecule affecting the pain associated with migraine.  Since nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes catalyse the synthesis of NO, the genes that code for these enzymes are good candidates for migraine molecular genetic analysis.  This research involved investigating the role of a functionally relevant bi-allelic tetranucleotide polymorphism located in the promoter region of the human inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene in migraine aetiology.  A large group of migraine affected individuals were genotyped and compared to an age and sex matched group of unaffected controls.  Results of a chi-squared analysis indicated that allele distributions for both migraine cases and controls were not significantly different (c2 = 1.93, P = 0.16).  These findings offer no evidence for an allelic association of the tested iNOS polymorphism with the common forms of the disease and therefore do not support a role for this gene in migraine pathogenesis. In summary, this research involved linkage and association analysis of migraine candidate genes and genomic susceptibility regions.  Whilst, the known FHM gene (CACNA1A) was excluded for significant involvement in typical migraine the adjacent INSR gene has been associated.  Migraine is genetically heterogeneous and the results of this research also provide good evidence that the DBH gene is involved in disease predisposition, whilst the DRD2, SERT and INOS gene were not shown to be implicated.  An additional susceptibility region for typical migraine is also likely to localise to chromosome 1q31.  Overall, the results presented in this thesis have contributed valuable data to the understanding of the molecular genetics of migraine with and without aura.  Future research into the molecular pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine will greatly facilitate the development of more effective diagnosis and treatment strategies.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">migraine</field><field name="subject">migraines</field><field name="subject">headache</field><field name="subject">headaches</field><field name="subject">genes</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">genom</field><field name="subject">ic susceptibility regions</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030526.153246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applicability of the Integrative Workplace Health Management (IWHM) Model in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Lee, Chiao-Tzu Patricia</field><field name="description">Over the past three decades, globalisation and rapid technological advances have fundamentally changed socio-economic structure and have widespread impacts on the nature of work and workplace health (U.  Beck, 2000; Bertucci &amp; Alberti, 2004; Bhalla, 1996; Chu &amp; Dwyer, 2002).  They have led to fierce global competition, altered the nature of work and exposed employees to new health risks (Chu &amp; Dwyer, 2002; Stitzel &amp; Jarvisalo, 1997).  Fierce market competition demands enterprises and industries to build new competencies, restructure and improve productivity and efficiency.  Associated with these changes are increased work pressures, weakening commitment to occupational health and safety, and many negative impacts on workers&#146; health (G. Breucker, 2006; Missler &amp; Theuringer, 2003; WHO, 2003).  Evidence shows that the world is facing growing burden of work related fatalities, injuries and diseases, particularly a dramatic increase of work stress.  As part of the global community, Taiwan has also encountered similar workplace challenges in the rapidly changing environment.  It also has to confront with increasing costs from the burden of work-related injuries and diseases and to find appropriate ways to deal with the serious problems (Council of Labour Affairs Taiwan, 2003, 3005; IOSH, 2002).  As the success of organisations relies on having well-qualified, motivated and healthy employees, it is essential to seek effective means to protect and promote the health of the working population (ENWHP, 2005).  The integrative workplace health promotion (IWHM) model emerging in the 1990s, is regarded as a comprehensive means to address multiple determinants of health and promote employee health (G. Breucker, 2006; Chu, 2003b; WHO-WPRO, 1999).  There have been a great number of international successful examples demonstrating the benefits from implementing the IWHM programs (ENWHP, 2002; Chu, Breucker, Harris, &amp; et al., 2000).  In response to these workplace challenges and new occupational health risks, Taiwan has followed the international trend to initiate a series of workplace health promotion (WHP) programs since 2001 (Bureau of Health Promotion Taiwan, 2006).  However, a preliminary study revealed that many WHP projects in Taiwan have met with difficulties in encouraging employee participation and sustainable development of the programs.  These results were not surprising as the majority of the WHP programs in Taiwan tended to narrowly focused on physical activities, weight control and smoking cessation, while ignoring employee needs and problems relevant to specific workplace concerns (Bureau of Health Promotion, 2003; Hsu, Chang, Peng, &amp; Chen, 2002; Hsu, Chen, &amp; Wu, 2004).  In this regard, the comprehensive IWHM which aims to meet employee health needs and improve organisational environment may present an effective means for Taiwan to address complex workplace health issues and to create healthy and sustainable workplaces.  This research aims to investigate the applicability of the IWHM model in Taiwan to deal with workplace health problems.  Apart from reviewing literature and relevant case studies from international communities and in Taiwan, this study conducted a small scale pilot study and a comprehensive needs assessment at selected workplaces in Taiwan as an experiment to test the applicability of the IWHM model.  In practice, this research project targeted the civil servants working at the Liming governmental community in Taichung, Taiwan as the research subject.  It involves a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods for data collection and analysis.  A variety of data collection techniques including in-depth interviews, focus groups, participant observations, secondary data analysis and questionnaire surveys are used to investigate the workplace health and safety problems and the staff&#146;s health needs.  A triangulation technique is used to compare and contrast the different sources of information.  The findings indicated that the IWHM model is applicable in the Liming community in terms of feasible methodological approaches using a needs-based program development and implementation process, and positive program outcomes such as stair improvement to prevent falls and the establishment of long-term health management, meaningful participation, practical program activities and holistic evaluation.  For potential program sustainability, this project has involved employee representatives in program implementation and taking in charge of the ongoing program activities, and has managed to establish interdepartmental partnership to address common workplace health issues. Even though this research project has not made great progress, it has been moving toward meeting the project objectives and the organisations&#146; needs.  From the Liming experience, this research provided recommendations for future development of WHP in Taiwan including: 1) develop national policies to define clear responsibilities in WHP development at different levels; 2) establish appropriate capacity building and training programs; 3) develop practical guidelines and tools tailored to suit Taiwan&#146;s local conditions and needs; 4) set up effective evaluation and quality management system; 5) provide a professional or technical support team to assist workplaces or industries with the development and implementation of WHP programs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrative Workplace Health Management</field><field name="subject">IWHM</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">work and workplace health</field><field name="subject">productivity</field><field name="subject">efficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070824.102636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ODE/MOL PDE Template For Soil Physics: A Numerical Study</field><field name="creator">Lee, Hock Seng</field><field name="description">The aim of the thesis is to find a method, in conjunction with the ordinary differential equation (ODE) based method of lines (MOL) solution of Richards&#146; equation, to model the steep wetting front infiltration in very dry soils, accurately and efficiently. Due to the steep pressure head or steep water volumetric content gradients, highly nonlinear soil hydraulic properties and the rapid movement of the wetting front, accurate solutions for infiltration into a dry soil are usually difficult to obtain. Additionally, such problems often require very small time steps and large computation times. As an enhancement to the used ODE/MOL approach, Higher Order Finite Differencing, Varying Order Finite Differencing, Vertical Scaling, Adaptive Schemes and Non-uniform Stretching Techniques have been implemented and tested in this thesis. Success has been found in the ability of Vertical Scaling to simulate very steep moving front solution for the Burgers&#146; equation. Unfortunately, the results also show that Vertical Scaling needs significant research and improvement before their full potential in routine applications for difficult nonlinear problems, such as Richard&#146;s equation with very steep moving front solution, can be realized. However, we have also shown that the use of the composed form of RE and a 2nd order finite differencing for the first order derivative approximation is conducive for modelling steep moving front problem in a very dry soil. Additionally, with the combination of an optimal influx value at the edges of the inlet, the ODE/MOL approach is able to model a 2-D infiltration in very dry soils, effectively and accurately. Furthermore, one of the strengths of this thesis is the use of a MATLAB PDE template. Implementing the ODE/MOL approach via a MATLAB PDE template has shown to be most suitable for modelling of partial differential equations. The plug and play mode of modifying the PDE template for solving time-dependent partial differential equations is user-friendly and easy, as compared to more conventional approaches using Pascal, Fortran, C or C++. The template offers greater modularity, flexibility, versatility, and efficiency for solving PDE problems in both 1-D and 2-D spatial dimensions. Moreover, the 2-D PDE template has been extended for irregular shaped domains.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ordinary differential equations</field><field name="subject">method of lines</field><field name="subject">OLE</field><field name="subject">MOL</field><field name="subject">MATLAB</field><field name="subject">PDE</field><field name="subject">PDE template</field><field name="subject">soil physics</field><field name="subject">soil infiltration</field><field name="subject">soil moisture</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030616.142709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling Computer Integated Construction Site Management</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jae Ho</field><field name="description">Construction is one of the most information-dependent industries compared to other sectors. Computers have been used to improve the efficiency of management in most businesses including the construction industry. Treating information efficiently is the key to maintaining an edge over competitors and for success in business. However, in order to succeed, companies must choose a management system that is most suited to their operations. The difficulty about computerization in civil engineering is that the construction industry does not have trained IT experts with Civil engineering or Management background. Although there are many computer applications for project management, almost all the applications required some form of manual modification for updating information. In a construction project, time and accurate information is vitally important in order to accomplish scheduled completion. A small change in plan costs money and time in both the traditional methods as well as current IT applications. The main reason is that there is no direct link between the head office and the regional site office and there is no &#147;quick&#148; link between site office and site engineers who are out in the field for most of the time. This study proposes the design of an information transfer system to improve construction site management. A Web-based Construction Site Management system called &#147;WCSM&#148; will be developed. WCSM incorporates some major features including: Integration of Web technology and mobile computing into construction site management and automatic project schedule updates. The performance of WCSM is evaluated through virtual simulations, and comparisons with other relevant applications are reported. These evaluations showed that WCSM required significantly less time, for initial project set up and modifications during project implementation, when compared to MS Project and Micro Planner.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">construction industry</field><field name="subject">civil engineering</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">information systems</field><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">construction projects</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040322.132814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using the Method of Paired Comparisons in Non-Designed Experiments</field><field name="creator">Lenton, Richard</field><field name="description">It is shown that a limitation of the various collation methods for paired comparison data currently available is their lack of validity when used in cases where the experiment is incomplete and particularly when the judgements are not replicated. Presented in this thesis is a reasonably thorough background to the method of paired comparisons and an overview of the existing methods for collating paired comparison data into a final ranking. As a result of the extensive review of existing collation methods, the thesis progresses logically to a new collation method that utilises all the available information from a set of pairwise preferences. The performance of the new collation method is extensively tested against existing methods by way of a simulation exercise which highlights the performance of the collation methods under different scenarios in terms of experiment size, experiment completeness and judgement consistency, as well as by considering the number of direct comparisons and the strength of competition. The new collation method and the existing collation method of Allen (1992) are applied to a set of real world data and the outcomes of the two methods are compared. The usefulness of paired comparisons in understanding the way judges use information to construct their own criteria when instructed to make preference decisions at a broad level is also considered and a real world application of this approach is performed. The main findings of this thesis are: &#132;F&#131;nThe new methodology generally provides an improved performance when there are more than 10 objects to be ranked; &#132;F&#131;nReplication of each pairwise judgement certainly improves the accuracy of the overall ranking, regardless of the level of judgement inconsistency; &#132;F&#131;nIn the case of non-replication, the accuracy of the final ranking greatly improves as judgement consistency improves. In other words, if it is not possible to replicate individual pairwise judgements then high judgement consistency is important for a reasonable result; In the case of replication, the accuracy of the returned ranking improves with judgement consistency only in the case of the new method. For the existing methods, the accuracy actually decreases marginally with the improvement of judgement consistency, particularly if there is a low level of experiment completeness; In terms of experiment completeness, for non-replicated experiments, there is an increase in the accuracy of the returned ranking as the proportion of possible pairwise preferences completed increases, but not to the same extent as an increase in judgement consistency. That is, judgement consistency is actually more important than experiment completeness. This suggests that control over the design of the experiment (the extent of completeness and which pairwise preferences are completed) is less important than judgement consistency and replication &#161;V certainly a finding not found reported in the literature; The new method outperforms the existing methods when there is perfect or very high judgement consistency.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Methods</field><field name="subject">Paired</field><field name="subject">Comparisons</field><field name="subject">Data</field><field name="subject">Experiments</field><field name="subject">Collation</field><field name="subject">Judgement</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071221.111859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Becoming a Chinese Language Teacher: Pre-Service Teachers' Perceptions of Chinese Learning and Teaching, and their Classroom Practices in Hong Kong</field><field name="creator">Leung, Pamela Pui-wan</field><field name="description">The continual decline of Chinese proficiency has caused serious concerns in Hong Kong. Although most Hong Kong people speak Chinese as their first language, they have not been strongly motivated to learn it in part because of the socio- economic status of English, and in part because of the discrepancies between the spoken and the written forms of Chinese. The absence of a link between the spoken dialect (Cantonese) and the written Modem Standard Chinese language (based mainly on the syntax of Mandarin) makes the learning of Chinese in the 'trilingual' (Cantonese, Mandarin and English) and 'biliterate' (Chinese and English) society laborious. The perception that Chinese proficiency is waning has led to criticisms of the quality of language teachers and language teacher education in the community. Hence, a study of the problems in Chinese language teacher education in Hong Kong is an indispensable step in improving the quality of Chinese language education in Hong Kong. This study takes pre-service teachers' (PST) perceptions as the predomhant factor in understanding how they learn to become a teacher of Chinese. As both students and teachers, the PSTs in this study provide insights into learning, teaching, and learning to teach, the Chinese language. Famous for its cultural tradition, Chinese teaching is typically transmissive. In particular, teachers of Chinese are expected to teach with a missionary zeal for 'educating' students by acting as exemplars. As a result, how a teacher teaches is often determined by how he or she was taught to interpret the nature of Chinese Language. The use of texts written by distinguished authors as teaching materials further encourages language teachers to give higher priority to literature, culture and moral education than language use. Inheriting such a tradition, modem Chinese language teacher education is faced with multiple challenges: to promote cognitive developments in teachers and cognitive teaching approaches to meet the needs of rapidly developing society, and to prepare teachers to maintain a proper balance between moral education and appreciation of culture and literature on the one hand, and teaching language use on the other. This study draws on the literature on Chinese language education, TESOL (teaching English to speakers of other languages), learning to teach, teacher knowledge, beliefs and perceptions, and develops a conceptual framework to interpret the relationships between perceptions and practices as a reciprocal cycle. Perceptions of self as a teacher, the subject matter, and teaching and learning of the subject matter are inseparable from the beliefs and knowledge of the PSTs, which affect how they prepare lesson plans to teach and actually teach in the classrooms. Planning and classroom practices are realised in teaching objectives, instructional strategies and evaluation of teaching effectiveness, which then reinforce knowledge, beliefs and perceptions. The cycle goes on as the PSTs learn more about teaching and accumulate teaching experiences. From this recurring cycle, the PSTs generate personal theories of teaching a specific subject. This study is longitudinal in design, which follows a logical procedure of inquiry. It first examines the PSTs' perceptions of teaching and learning Chinese on entry to, during and on exit from a.two-year teacher education program. Then it turns to the perceptual development and the sources of perceptions and perceptual changes, and how they impact on the PSTs. Finally, the complex relationship between perceptions, lesson planning and classroom practices are elaborated. In particular, data collected in some stages were dependent on the findings of the preceding stage. This adds complexity to the overall research desip of the study. This study uses a multimethod approach with two research populations -the questionnaire surveys of the entire cohort and qualitative data collection from twelve sub-sample participants. Because of the lack of well-established research instruments in the Chinese research context, all methods of inquiry have been revised according to the results of pilot studies. The multimethod approach in this study demonstrates how questionnaire surveys, repertory grids, individual interviews, focus groups, classroom observations and the analyses of lesson plans and reflective journals can be used in a complementary manner to assure the validity of the research. Questionnaire surveys yield the overall perceptions of the cohort on entry to and exit from the teacher education program. The perceptual development of the entire cohort is understood by the findings of the two surveys. Against the backdrop of the overall perceptions of the cohort, the qualitative methods are used to study the sub-sample. Repertory grids reveal the participants' views of teachers of Chinese from different perspectives, whereas individual interviews and focus group discussions tap more deeply into the participants' thinking about how they have learned to teach Chinese. Other qualitative methods such as classroom observation and the analyses of lesson plans and reflective journals provide compelling evidence for indicating the extent that the participants have grasped the craft of teaching. This study suggests from the persistent perceptions and perceptual development of the PSTs that Chinese language education in Hong Kong has been ineffective. Ineffective Chinese language education has a long-lasting negative impact on students including the PSTs. The strong emphasis on literature, culture and moral education, and the knowledge telling and teacher-led traditions have led to a low level of cognitive demand in Chinese teaching. The procedures recommended for teaching a text in Chinese and the assessment criteria of the teacher education program have encouraged the,PSTs to become more didactic in teaching, although they themselves are aware that they should pay more attention to the needs of students. This study argues that student teachers' perspectives form a critical element in reforming Chinese language teacher education in Hong Kong, and that language teacher education should first be ameliorated before language education can be effectively improved. Not only should PSTs of Chinese Language be equipped with better subject matter knowledge, general pedagogical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, but Chinese language teacher educators should also be cognisant of the necessity for change. Because learning to teach is often discipline-based, it is more cost-effective and consistent if the teacher educators' Chinese language classes also emphasise cognitive development in the PSTs. To be real exemplars for the PSTs, the Chinese language teacher educators should be involved in continuing critical evaluation of their own practices.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese lanuage teachers</field><field name="subject">Chinese learning</field><field name="subject">Classroom language learning</field><field name="subject">language teacher education</field><field name="subject">Hong Kong</field><field name="subject">Cantonese</field><field name="subject">Mandarin</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051103.122245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Measurement of Short- and Long- Term Returns of Chinese Initial Public Offerings and the Identification of Corporate Governance Variables That May Explain These Returns</field><field name="creator">Li, Qiang</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship between the aftermarket performance of Chinese initial public offerings (IPOs) and corporate governance for firms that listed during the years 1999 to 2001. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the significance of corporate governance variables as explanations of IPOs aftermarket performance. By doing so, a set of hypotheses dealing with the relationships between IPO aftermarket performance and three categories of independent variables: corporate governance variables; issue variables; and control variables, were examined. The descriptive analysis indicates that IPOs in China continue to provide significant short-term returns to investors, although the level of underpricing has declined from that found in earlier studies. This finding suggests a growing level of maturity and sophistication in the Chinese IPO market. The analysis of long-term performance indicates negative returns to investors which is consistent with international evidence but challenges the bulk of prior Chinese studies. It is found that there is no significant relationship between corporate governance variables and IPO returns in the short-term with the exception of board composition, while IPO underpricing is primarily explained by the imbalance between supply and demand and the inefficient capital market in China. The significance of board composition can be explained by the launch of the new corporate governance code on board structures in 2001. Overall the empirical evidence shows that the Information Asymmetry Hypothesis is an appropriate explanation of the underpricing of Chinese IPOs. In the long-term, it is found that corporate governance variables do have explanatory power for the market performance of Chinese IPOs, in particular state ownership and the separation of Chairman and CEO, supporting the notion that corporate governance appears to be important to IPO investors in the long-term. It also confirms the view that investors are willing to pay a premium for the shares of what they consider to be well-governed firms in the long-term. Besides corporate governance variables, both issue variables and control variables are also found to have explanatory power in IPO aftermarket performance. In particular firm size, IPO offer price, IPO lottery rate and industry are significantly related to IPO short-term performance in China, while growth in earning per share, firm size and industry are related to the long-term market performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese initial public offerings</field><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="subject">issue variables</field><field name="subject">control variables</field><field name="subject">short term returns to investors</field><field name="subject">capital market (China)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061017.155437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of New Binding Phases for Speciation Measurements of Trace Metals with the Diffusive Gradients in Thin Films Technique</field><field name="creator">Li, Weijia</field><field name="description">The recently developed technique of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) for speciation measurement of analytes in the environment was further developed through the development of series of new binding phases including poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) copolymer hydrogel (PAM-PAA), poly(acrylamidoglycolic acid-co-acrylamide) (PAAGA-PAM) hydrogel, the Whatman P81 cellulose phosphate ion exchange membrane (P81) and a liquid binding phase of poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS).  A new diffusion layer, cellulose dialysis membrane, was also employed for the liquid binding phase DGT.   PAM-PAA copolymer hydrogel was prepared by the controlled hydrolysis of polyacrylamide (PAM) in an alkaline solution of 10% sodium hydroxide.  The capacity of the copolymer hydrogel to bind various metal ions was tested under a range of uptake conditions.  Ions such as Cu2+ and Cd2+ were bound more strongly to the copolymer hydrogel than the competing ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+.  Metals bound to the copolymer hydrogel can be efficiently eluted in 2 M HNO3 solution (&gt;94%).  Application of this new binding material to DGT technique was validated in a synthetic lake water (Windermere, Lake District, UK) with a recovery of 99.0% for Cu2+.  PAAGA-PAM hydrogel was prepared by copolymerising 2-acrylamidoglycolic acid with acrylamide.  The metal ion binding properties of the hydrogel were characterised for Cu2+, Cd2+ and competing ions under various experimental conditions.  The hydrogel was shown to bind Cu2+ and Cd2+ strongly under non-competitive binding conditions, with binding capacities of 5.3 and 5.1 micromol cm-2, respectively.  The binding capacity of each metal decreased, under competitive binding conditions (with a range of metal ions present at 17.8 mN), to 1.3 and 0.17 micromol cm-2, respectively, indicating a strong selective binding towards Cu2+.  The metal ions were readily recovered (&gt;94%) by eluting with 2 M HNO3.  Finally, the copolymer hydrogel was tested as a binding phase with the DGT technique.  A linear mass vs. time relationship was observed for Cu2+ in Windermere water with a recovery of close to 100%.  The use of a commercially available solid ion exchange membrane (P81) as the binding phase in DGT analysis was demonstrated.  P81 is a strong cation exchange membrane.  Its performance characteristics as a new binding phase in DGT measurement of Cu2+ and Cd2+ were systematically investigated.  Several advantages over the conventional ion exchange resin-embedded hydrogel based binding phases used in DGT were observed.  These include: simple preparation, ease of handling, and reusability.  The binding phase preferentially binds to transition metal ions rather than competing ions.  Within the optimum pH range (pH 4.0 - 9.0), the maximum non-competitive binding capacities of the membrane for Cu2+ and Cd2+ were 3.22 and 3.07 micromol cm-2, respectively.  The suitability of the new membrane-based binding phase for DGT applications was validated experimentally.  The results demonstrated excellent agreement with theoretically predicted trends.  The reusability of this binding phase was also investigated.  Application of a liquid binding phase and a dialysis membrane diffusive layer were proposed for the first time.  The binding phase was a 0.020 M solution of poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) polyelectrolyte using a specially designed DGT device.  The binding properties of Cd2+, Cu2+, and a range of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions to the PSS solution were characterised.  The PSS behaved like a cation exchanger with preferential binding to Cd2+ (6.0 micromole ml-1, log K = 9.0) and Cu2+ (2.5 micromole ml-1, log K = 8.1) under competitive binding conditions.  The DGT devices were successfully validated for Cd2+ and Cu2+ in Windermere water.  The speciation performance of the solid and liquid binding phases developed in this study was investigated in solutions containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA), humic acid (HA), glucose (GL), dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBS) and tannic acid (TA) with Cu2+ and Cd2+.  The ratios of labile metals over total metals were at good agreement with calculated theoretical values using Stability Constants Database.  The results indicated that the DGT-labile concentration measured by DGT with these binding phases is essentially free metal ion concentration in the sample.  All newly developed DGT binding phases were successfully applied for environmental speciation.  The field deployments were carried out in both freshwater and salt-water test sites.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thin films</field><field name="subject">diffusive gradients in thin films</field><field name="subject">DGT</field><field name="subject">speciation</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">binding phases</field><field name="subject">ion exchange</field><field name="subject">trace metals</field><field name="subject">water quality measurement</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040504.150905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and Design of Virtual Reality Visualization for a Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) CAD Tool</field><field name="creator">Li, Zhaoyi</field><field name="description">Since the proliferation of CAD tools, visualizations have gained importance.. They provide invaluable visual feedback at the time of design, regardless whether it is fbi civil engineering or electronic circuit design-layout. Typically dynamic visualizations are produced in a two phase process: the calculation of positions and rendering of the image and its presentation as an animated video clip. This is a slow process that is unsuitable fbr interactive CAD visualizations, because the former two require finite element analysis Faster hardware eases the problem, but does not overcome it, because the algorithms are still too slow. Our MEMS CAD project works towards methods and techniques that are suitable for interactive design, with faster methods. The purpose of this PhD thesis is to contribute to the design of an interactive virtual prototyping of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) This research comprises the analysis of the visualization techniques that are appropriate for these tasks and identifying the difficulties that need to be overcome to be able to offer a MEMS design engineer a meaningful and interactive CAD design environment Such a   VR-CAD system is being built in our research group with many participants in the team. Two particular problems are being addressed by presenting algorithms for truthful VR visualization methods: one is for displaying objects that are different in size on the computer screen. The other is modelling unsynchronized motion dynamics, that is different objects moving simultaneously at very high and vety low speed, by proposing stroboscopic simulation to present their dynamics on the screen They require specific size scaling and time scaling and filtering. It is these issues and challenges which make the design of a MEMS CAD tool different from other CAD tools. In the thesis I present algorithms for displaying animated virtual reality for MEMS virtual prototyping in a physically truthful way by using the simulated stroboscopic illumination to filter animated images to make it possible to show unsynchronized motion.. A scaling method was used to show or hide objects which cannot be shown simultaneously on the computer screen because of their large difference in size. The visualization of objects being designed and their animations is done with much consideration of visual perception and computer capability, which is rising attention, but not too often mentioned in the visualization domain.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CAD tools</field><field name="subject">dynamic visualizations</field><field name="subject">Micro Electro Mechanical Systems</field><field name="subject">MEMS CAD project</field><field name="subject">VR-CAD system</field><field name="subject">virtual reality visualization</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060731.121340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics, Competencies and Challenges: A Quantitative and Qualitative Study of the Senior Health Executive Workforce in New South Wales, 1990-1999</field><field name="creator">Liang, Zhanming</field><field name="description">Healthcare reforms and restructuring have been a global phenomenon since the early 1980s. The major structural reforms in the healthcare system in New South Wales (NSW) including the introduction and implementation of the area health management model (1986), the senior executive service (1989) and performance agreements (1990), heralded a new era in management responsibility and accountability. It is believed that the reforms, the process of the reforms, and the instability brought about by the reforms may have not only resulted in the change of senior healthcare management practices, but also in the change of competencies required for senior healthcare managers in meeting the challenges in the new era. However, limited studies have been conducted which examined how health reforms affected its senior health executive workforce and the above changes. Moreover, no study on senior healthcare managers has focused specifically on NSW after the major reforms were implemented.  The purpose of this research was to examine how reforms in the NSW Health public sector affected its senior health executive workforce between 1990 and 1999 in terms of their roles and responsibilities, the competencies required, and the challenges they faced. This study, from a broad perspective, aimed to provide an overview of the NSW reforms, the forces behind the reforms and the effects the reforms may have had on senior health managers as predicted by the national and international literature. This study also explored the changes to the senior health executive workforce in the public sector during the period of rapid change in the 1990s and has provided indications of the managerial educational needs for future senior healthcare managers.  Both quantitative and qualitative data have been collected by this study using triangulated methods including scientific document review and analyses, a postal questionnaire survey, and in-depth telephone interviews. The findings from the two quantitative methods informed and guided the development of the open-ended questions and overall focus of the telephone interviews.  This study found differences in the characteristics and employment-related aspects between this study and previous studies in the 1980s and 1990s, and identified four major tasks, twelve key roles and seven core competencies required by senior health executives in the NSW Health public sector between 1990 and 1999. The study concludes that the demographic characteristics and the roles and responsibilities of the NSW Health senior executive workforce since the reforms of the 1980s have changed.  This study also identified seven major obstacles and difficulties experienced by senior health executives and suggested that during the introduction and implementation of major healthcare reforms in NSW since 1986, barriers created by the &#145;system&#146; prevented the achievement of its full potential benefits. Although this study did not focus on detailed strategies on how to minimise the negative impact of the health reforms on the senior health executives or maximise the chance of success in introducing new changes to the system, some suggestions are proposed.  Most significantly, the study has developed a clear analytical framework for understanding the pyramidal relationships between tasks, roles and competencies and has developed and piloted a new competency assessment approach for assessing the core competencies required by senior health managers. These significant findings indicate the need for a replication of the study on an Australia-wide scale in order to extend the generalisability of the results and test the reliability and validity of the new competency assessment approach at various management levels in a range of healthcare sectors.  This is the first study acknowledging the impact of the introduction of the area health management model, the senior executive service and performance agreements in the NSW public health system through an original insight into the personal experiences of the senior health executives of the reforms and examination of the major tasks that senior health executives performed and relevant essential competencies required to perform these tasks. The possible solutions identified in this study can guide the development of strategies in providing better support to senior healthcare managers when large-scale organisational changes are proposed in the future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">healthcare system</field><field name="subject">New South Wales (NSW)</field><field name="subject">area health management model</field><field name="subject">senior healthcare</field><field name="subject">senior health executive workforce</field><field name="subject">Healthcare reforms</field><field name="subject">1980s</field><field name="subject">1990s</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070914.091446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating Strategic Environmental Assessment into Transport Planning</field><field name="creator">Lien, Jung-Hsun</field><field name="description">Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has become recognised as an improvement on the existing, limited system of project-based EIA. It aims to integrate environmental considerations into government policies, plans and programmes, and provides a basis for arriving at better-informed decisions at broader strategic levels. However, the compatibility of this new environmental planning tool with other planning systems such as transport, holds the key to successful integration of environmental concerns into existing planning approaches. This study investigates whether SEA can influence and integrate with transport planning and policy development processes through a survey of attitudes and opinions of planners on transport SEA in Taiwan.  Transport planning has been criticised for considering too few alternatives, and for basing evaluations solely on technical and economic grounds. The emerging SEA seems theoretically feasible and potentially beneficial in allowing the integration of environmental concerns into strategic transport planning. Though many countries or regions have transport SEA provisions, practical transport SEA applications remain limited, mostly in Western developed countries with high environmental awareness. SEA applications are also limited in their strategies, focusing mainly on infrastructure-related projects. Moreover, most current transport SEA practices lack strategic focus and thus fail to fulfill SEA principles. This suggests that many planners are unfamiliar with the nature and techniques of SEA, and the conceptual impediments are still critical, which may result in significant barriers to transport SEA application.  The EIA Act promulgated in 1994, together with its relevant provisions, have provided an applicable mechanism and a legal basis for SEA application in Taiwan, however, no transport SEA cases have been conducted. Many technical and non-technical barriers have been identified by the interviewees, indicating that most of the planners in Taiwan believe that transport SEA is conceptually and practically immature, and planners are not yet ready for it. The conceptual barriers seem more critical at this stage because practical barriers can only be identified and overcome when planners and decision-makers have a clear and proper concept of SEA. This narrowly-viewed application has limited the benefits of SEA, and has resulted in a rigid and incorrect idea that SEA was a passive impact-reducing mechanism; this may mislead the attitudes of planners to transport SEA.  In fact, the emerging SEA is a re-engineered planning system framework that serves to remind planners that they are able to improve their efforts. It is a paradigm revolution, as the way in which planners think can make a vast difference. Thus, the potential for the emerging SEA concept to influence and integrate with transport planning and transport policy development processes depends not only on practical feasibility but also on a fundamental conceptual recognition of transport SEA. SEA could influence and integrate with transport planning and transport policy development processes if planners and decision-makers changed their ways of thinking.  This study also found that a tiered and integrated transport SEA, embedded in the main transport planning process at different strategic levels, has great potential to embody the environmental and sustainable concerns in transport planning and decision-making. This finding is based on several contentions supported by the recent SEA studies showing that it should not be detached from the main planning process. SEA needs to be flexible in order to meet various policies, plans and programmes (PPP) demands, and it must be value-driven, not impact-oriented. A tiered, integrated transport SEA provides ways to overcome identified transport SEA application impediments. This two-in-one planning system is a simple solution which allows transport SEA to be conducted without involving complex legal processes. It improves institutional coordination and integrates not only with planning processes but also with values and resources.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic environmental assessment</field><field name="subject">SEA</field><field name="subject">Transport Planning</field><field name="subject">Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">EIA</field><field name="subject">planning tool</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070813.155624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and Application of SiC Power MOSFET</field><field name="creator">Linewih, Handoko</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the design of high voltage MOSFET on SiC and its application in power electronic systems. Parameters extraction for 4H SiC MOS devices is the main focus of the first topic developed in this thesis. Calibration of two-dimensional (2-D) device and circuit simulators (MEDICI and SPICE) with state-of-the-art 4H SiC MOSFETs data are performed, which includes the mobility parameter extraction. The experimental data were obtained from lateral N-channel 4H SiC MOSFETs with nitrided oxide-semiconductor interfaces, exhibiting normal mobility behavior. The presence of increasing interface-trap density (Dit) toward the edge of the conduction band is included during the 2-D device simulation. Using measured distribution of interface-trap density for simulation of the transfer characteristics leads to good agreement with the experimental transfer characteristic. The results demonstrate that both MEDICI and SPICE simulators can be used for design and optimization of 4H SiC MOSFETs and the circuits utilizing these MOSFETs. Based on critical review of SiC power MOSFETs, a new structure of SiC accumulation-mode MOSFET (ACCUFET) designed to address most of the open issues related to MOS interface is proposed. Detailed analysis of the important design parameters of the novel structure is performed using MEDICI with the parameter set used in the calibration process. The novel structure was also compared to alternative ACCUFET approaches, specifically planar and trench-gate ACCUFETs. The comparison shows that the novel structure provides the highest figure of merit for power devices. The analysis of circuit advantages enabled by the novel SiC ACCUFET is given in the final part of this thesis. The results from circuit simulation show that by utilizing the novel SiC ACCUFET the operating frequency of the circuit can be increased 10 times for the same power efficiency of the system. This leads to dramatic improvements in size, weight, cost and thermal management of power electronic systems.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MOSFETs</field><field name="subject">Power MOSFETs</field><field name="subject">SiC</field><field name="subject">4H-SiC</field><field name="subject">ACCUFET</field><field name="subject">metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors</field><field name="subject">silicon carbide</field><field name="subject">semiconductors</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030506.013152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA Aberrations in Atypical Cancer Cohorts</field><field name="creator">Lintell, Nicholas Adrian</field><field name="description">The incidence of Squamous Cell Carcinoma is growing in certain populations to the extent that it is now the most common skin lesion in young men and women in high ultraviolet exposure regions such as Queensland. In terms of incidence up to 45% of the Australian population over 40 years of age is thought to possess the precancerous Solar Keratosis lesion and with a small but significant chance of progression into SCC, understanding the genetic events that play a role in this process is essential. The major aims of this study were to analyse whole blood derived samples for DNA aberrations in genes associated with tumour development and cellular maintenance, with the ultimate aim of identifying genes associated with non-melanoma skin cancer development. This study had an explicit emphasis on the mitochondrial genome and nuclear genes that encode for subunits in the mitochondrial regulated energy transducing oxidative phosphorylation pathways. More specifically the first aim of this project was to analyse the NDUFA8, PTCH, NDUFAS, SMOH, SDHD, MMPI2, NDUFV1, EMSI, COXVIIc, and RASAI genes via non-specific fluorophoric Real-Time PCR for genetic aberrations in an affected Solar Keratosis and control cohort. The second aim was to analyse two specific genes, SDHD and MMPI2, for copy number aberrations via Dual-Labelled Probe Real-Time PCR in the same affected Solar Keratosis and control cohort. The third aim was to analyse Mitochondrial DNA Depletion syndrome (MDS) in a chemically exposed RAAF personnel cohort via Dual-Labelled Probe Real-Time PCR. The significance of these studies is in their contribution to the knowledge of the genetic pathways that are malformed in the progression and development of the pre-cancerous skin lesion Solar Keratosis. Furthermore, it would determine whether the genes analysed in this study exist in greater prevalence in the affected Solar Keratosis population compared to the control cohort. With regard to the MDS component, identifying the presence of this disease in these individuals was initially undertaken as part of a study to provide evidence in compensation claims. The diagnosis may assist in their medical therapy, insofar as some of them were now suffering from liver malfunctions and atypical male breast cancer. Another application of this effective and low cost method of diagnosing MDS is in populations with high HTV incidences. This is due to the fact that the most common drug used to treat this disease can give rise to the expression of MDS, thus further complicating the health status of HIV infected individuals. The analysis of this research was accomplished via the Real-Time PCR technique, with a non-specific fluorophore component in addition to specific Dual-Labelled Probe components, to ascertain the general nature of any aberration identified in the sample cohort. This project also employed additional methods of analysis such as DHPLC and DNA sequencing to assist in determining the veracity of its aims, particularly in terms of the precise detection of genetic aberrations via Real-Time PCR. Patients exhibiting male breast cancer and liver malftinctions were also analysed via Dual-Labelled Probe RealTime PCR to ascertain the presence of Mitochondrial DNA Depletion syndrome, a disorder characterised by lactic acidosis, liver failure, seizures, and congestive heart failure. Determining the presence of this syndrome in these patients would assist in their medical treatment, and contribute to the analytical methods available to diagnose this syndrome, which is known to occur in HIV sufferers due to the nucleoside drugs used to combat the disease. Real-Time PCR can adequately gauge the integrity of a genetic area in terms of amplicon malformities (non-specific-fluorophoric) and DNA copy number aberrations (Dual-Labelled Probe) via fluorophore signal differentials compared to wild-type samples and housekeeper profiles. The results of the first component of this project, namely the analysis of five gene pairs by non-specific fluorophoric Real-Time PCR, highlighted that a significantly higher incidence of putative aberrants is evident in the affected population when compared to the control cohort. The genes analysed were NDUFA8, PTCH, NDUFA5, SMOH, SDHD, MMP 12, NDUFVI, EMS 1, COXVIIc, and RASA 1. These ten genes were subdivided into five pairs; one of the pair being a gene associated with the development of a non-melanotic skin cancer (NMSC), the other a gene encoding for a subunit of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC). Each of these pairs exists in close proximity to one another on a particular chromosomal locale. Differences were highlighted in the single gene triplicate run population. The ETC genes (NDUFA8, NDUFA5, SDHD, NIDUFVI, COXVIIc) exhibited 10 / 720 (1.37%) as being putative mutants in the control population, compared to 117 / 675 (17.3%) for the affected population (p value less than 0.0001). The NMSC gene analysis (PTCH, SMOH, MMPI2, EMSI, RASA1) produced a 16 / 720 (2.22%) ratio for the control population, with the affected population having an incidence of 97 / 675 (14.4 %) for putative mutants (p value less than 0.0001). The observance of putative aberrants in the NDUFVI (p less than 0.018), EMS1 (p less than 0.003), COXVTIc (p less than 0.001), and RASA I (p less than 0.009) genes in the affected Solar Keratosis (SK) population was significantly higher than that observed in the control population. The majority of aberrations detected via the non-specific fluorophoric Real-Time PCR technique were small nucleotide base insertions and deletions. The analysis of the SK affected and control cohort via Real-Time PCR proved a cost-effective and reliable method in identifying the presence of DNA aberrations such as non-instructional sites. The results of the second component extended the findings of the non-specific fluorophoric analysis. The SDHD and MMPI 2 genes were analysed for copy number aberrations via Dual-Labelled Probe Real-Time PCR for genetic aberrations the same affected and control Solar Keratosis cohort. It was found that 12 of 279 samples had identifiable copy-number aberrations in either the SDHD or MMPI2 gene (this means that a genetic section of either of these two genes is aberrantly amplified or deleted), with five of the samples exhibiting aberrations in both genes. The MMPI2 gene also had nine samples identified as possessing an intronic heterozygous base-pair substitution anomaly via DNA sequencing. The NDUFA8 gene had 12 samples identified as anomalous via the DHPLC technique, 11 of which were identified via non-specific fluorophoric Real-Time PCR, with the analysis performed to verify the accuracy of the Real-Time technique in identifying DNA aberrations. This study identified DNA aberrations in an affected Solar Keratosis and control cohort and ascertained several particular genomic abnomialities in the SDHD, MMPI2 and NDUFA8 genes, with an emphasis on copy-number aberrations and amplicon abnormalities. In the third component of this study, namely the analysis of Mitochondrial DNA Depletion syndrome (MDS) in a jet-fuel exposed RAAF personnel cohort via Dual-Labelled Probe Real-Time PCR, the results indicated that four of the seven patients were expressing MDS. Of the four patients who exhibited a reduction in mitochondrial copy-number the average decrease was of a four-fold level, or approximately a depletion of mitochondrial copies from 200 plus to ~ 54 (74 % reduction in MtDNA). The patients who contributed DNA for investigation into the presence of MDS were suffering from liver malfunction and atypical male breast cancer. The Dual-Labelled Probe technique proved a reliable and cost effective method in identifying the presence of MDS in these patients, with the DNA extracted from fresh white blood cells that had been isolated using the Ficoll-Hypaque method. The importance of this is that accurate levels of Mitochondrial DNA copy numbers can be ascertained in white blood cells as it removes the presence of platelets, which also contain mitochondria but no nucleus. The analysis of ETC and NMSC associated genes in addition to mitochondrial copy number integrity means that this study investigated two aspects of the carcinogenetic pathway i.e. abnormal energy regulation and the regulation of micromolecular and macromolecular cellular homeostatic mechanisms. The mechanism of programmed cell death or apoptosis is regulated by the mitochondria and the ability of a genetically damaged cell to evade the apoptotic process is directly linked to a cell becoming cancerous. It is only after the evasion of apoptosis and the replication of the damaged cells' DNA into daughter cells that neoplastic events can occur. Thus, this study contributed to the understanding of how neo-plastic lesions may develop and progress into invasive tumours. It additionally assisted in proving the effectiveness of the RealTime PCR technique in detecting DNA aberrations and mitochondrial copy number anomalies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Squamous cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">solar keratosis lesion</field><field name="subject">DNA sequencing</field><field name="subject">Real-Time PCR technique</field><field name="subject">mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome</field><field name="subject">Ficoll-Hypaque method</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061009.164402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effectiveness of Interpretation in Reducing the Impacts of Visitors in National Parks</field><field name="creator">Littlefair, Carolyn Joy</field><field name="description">With visitation to natural areas increasing, the appropriate management of these areas is important. There are a number of management tools available which endeavour to minimise environmental impacts of visitors. One such management tool is interpretation. Interpretation is widely used as a management tool because: it is perceived to be the most cost effective method; it is a light-handed approach and allows visitors the freedom of choice; and it enhances visitor experiences and satisfaction. However, the ability of interpretation to bring about a reduction in the impacts of visitors to natural areas, has rarely been quantified. This study was designed to determine the extent to which an interpretive program reduced the environmental impacts of visitors to national parks. Fieldwork was undertaken in Lamington National Park, where 41 guided walks were examined. To measure the actual behaviour or resulting impacts of visitors in a national park, three appropriate environmental indicators were chosen: shortcutting of corners, picking up litter already on the track, and noise levels. Five interpretive programs were created, each with a different combination of environmental interpretation, role modelling and verbal appeals. For the shortcutting results, the interpretive program with the combination of environmental interpretation, role modelling by the guide and verbal appeals from the guide, was always the most effective in reducing shortcutting. Visitors in this interpretive program were always, statistically, less likely to shortcut than visitors on all the other interpretive programs. The programs with only environmental interpretation or no environmental interpretation, were always least effective in reducing shortcutting. The interpretive programs with environment interpretation plus role modelling, or verbal appeals, were always in the middle of these extremes. They were more effective than having neither role modelling or verbal appeals, but less effective than having both. Results for the amount of litter picked up found that the inclusion of verbal appeals in an interpretive program was the only factor that influenced whether visitors picked up litter. In addition, there was no difference in the amount of litter picked up, by the interpretive program with environmental interpretation only, and the program with no environmental interpretation. Results for the noise levels of visitors, found that no interpretive program reduced the amount of shouting and talking loudly of visitors. Although not statistically significant, it did appear that there were lower proportions of shouting and talking loudly, following a verbal appeal and/or role modelling. Additionally, there was no influence of the interpretive program on the proportion of time visitors were talking, or quiet, during their walk. Overall, this research found that interpretation can be an effective management tool in reducing visitor impacts. Interpretation is most effective in reducing impacts when those impacts are specifically addressed through verbal appeals, combined with positive role modelling of appropriate behaviours. However, interpretation did not reduce all the impacts studied and therefore is not the solution to all problems. Implications of this study are that those using interpretation as a means of reducing visitor impacts, must ensure that they have a high standard of interpretation, which specifically addresses the impacts that need to be reduced. It also highlights the importance of the role of the guide, and that those employed should be well trained and competent in their position.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental interpretation</field><field name="subject">interpretive programs</field><field name="subject">national parks</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Lamington National Park</field><field name="subject">human impact</field><field name="subject">impacts</field><field name="subject">visitor impacts</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050324.085357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Artificial Destratification on Limnological Processes in Lake Samsonvale (North Pine Dam), Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Littlejohn, Carla Louise</field><field name="description">Artificial destratification equipment was installed in Lake Samsonvale in October 1995 to reduce the biomass of potentially toxic cyanobacteria in the reservoir. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of the destratifier on the limnological processes occurring in the lake and to determine if operation of the destratifier has been effective at reducing the summer populations of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Microcystis aeruginosa. The study showed that artificial destratification of Lake Samsonvale has been successful at reducing the surface to bottom thermal gradient and increasing dissolved oxygen concentrations at depth. While the destratifier has not resulted in the lake becoming completely 'mixed' during summer, it has weakened resistance to mixing from meteorological events, which has led to a reduction in mean concentrations of total and dissolved phosphorus during summer. Although not conclusive, it is likely that the influence of the destratifier is restricted to a narrow radial distance around the bubbleplumes during periods of strong stability, so internal loading may continue to provide a substantial source of nutrients for cyanobacterial growth, particularly in regions of the lake less influenced by the destratifier. The results for cyanobacteria are less encouraging. Despite the reduction in concentrations of dissolved phosphorus, the destratifier has not been effective at reducing summer populations of C. raciborskii and M. aeruginosa. On the contrary, there is evidence to suggest that populations have actually increased which could have serious operational consequences for the lake by mixing the previously buoyant cyanobacteria to the level of the water off-take. The growth season for C. raciborskii has been extended by up to 3 months and population onset now occurs during spring. This increase in spring populations could be a result of significantly greater baseline populations during winter, or the earlier germination of akinetes as a result of increased sediment temperatures. The seasonal successional relationship between C. raciborskii and M. aeruginosa appears to have shifted from one of alternating dominance between the two species to one of co-existence under conditions of intermediate disturbance. It was concluded that although the continued operation of the destratifier may prove useful to minimise water treatment costs through reducing internal loading of dissolved constituents, it has not been successful in achieving its original objective of controlling cyanobacterial populations in the lake.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">destratification</field><field name="subject">destratifying</field><field name="subject">reservoir</field><field name="subject">reservoirs</field><field name="subject">dam</field><field name="subject">dams</field><field name="subject">lake</field><field name="subject">lakes</field><field name="subject">Lake Samsonvale</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">purification</field><field name="subject">cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050211.133123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of Language Learning Strategies and Learner Variables of Sri Lankan Learners of English as a Second Language with Special Reference to Their Personality Types</field><field name="creator">Liyanage, Indika Jananda Borala</field><field name="description">This study explores the relationship between language learning strategies and learner variables of Sri Lankan learners of English as a Second Language (ESL) with special reference to their personality types to examine what implications these associations have for the teaching of ESL in the Sri Lankan sociocultural context. In order to investigate the above, a large and representative sample of the ESL population was chosen. The sample taken for analysis comprised 886 subjects from six secondary schools which operate under the Ministry of Education in the Sri Lankan government. These subjects belonged to three distinct subcultures as demarcated by their first language (L1), Religion and Ethnicity in Sri Lanka. Data were collected using two questionnaires - a language learning strategy inventory and a personality assessment questionnaire, between April 2002 and June 2002 in Sri Lanka. Two statistical tests were used to measure the associations between the learner variables and language learning strategies: Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and Univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The findings show differences in strategy use or rather the ways the three groups learn the target language indicating that these strategy choices are closely correlated to their personality type, gender and religion/ethnicity. The findings also indicate that these variables affect the strategy choices both as collective and individual forces and when working as collective forces there is a complex interplay between these variables. While this study clearly demonstrates the association between learner variables and language learning strategies, it acknowledges the possible dangers in discussing these associations in cross-cultural comparisons. It also suggests the need for more ethnographic research to further elucidate the findings obtained in the current study. Based on these findings in the current study, this thesis strongly argues that ELT pedagogy cannot be independent of the Sri Lankan sociocultural context. It is therefore strongly suggested that ELT pedagogies should: (1) develop within the socio -cultural contexts of the learners; (2) be orientated to the culture of speakers of a Sri Lankan variety of English; (3) incorporate teaching material based on rhetoric indigenous to their culture. The study also shows the complexities of ESL instruction in the Sri Lankan socio-cultural context where its history, different cultures, first languages, ethnicities and religions all make a significant contribution to the learning/teaching of the target language. The challenge for teaching ESL in Sri Lanka is even higher given that all languages come with their own cultural, historical and ethnic trappings.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">learner</field><field name="subject">learners</field><field name="subject">ELT</field><field name="subject">ESL</field><field name="subject">second language</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Sri Lankan</field><field name="subject">Sri Lankans</field><field name="subject">strategy</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">sociocultural</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">cultural</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040716.112300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Developmental Approach to the Prevention of Anxiety Disorders During Childhood</field><field name="creator">Lock, Sally</field><field name="description">The studies presented in this thesis sought to investigate a number of developmental factors that influence the efficacy of preventive intervention for child anxiety disorders. Preventive intervention has emerged as a vital step forward in clinical research following data indicating anxiety disorders are among the most common forms of psychopathology in youngsters (Kashani &amp; Orvaschel, 1990; Mattison, 1992). Several risk and protective factors associated with childhood anxiety disorders have been identified, along with effective treatment protocols (Kendall, 1994; Howard &amp; Kendall, 1996; Barrett, 1998, 1999; Silverman et al., 1999a, 1999b), as prerequisites to the development of preventive programs for child anxiety problems (Spence, 2001). The first objective of this research was to add to the literature on risk and protective factors by investigating the role of peer interaction in the development of child anxiety problems. Study one examined developmental differences in the influence of peer interaction on children's anxiety-related cognition and behaviour.  One hundred and sixty two children enrolled in grade 6 (n = 96) aged between 9 and 10 years, and grade 9 (n = 66) aged between 14 and 16 years participated in the study. Participants were stratified into either an at risk group or to a healthy group, based on their anxiety scores on the Spence Child Anxiety Scale (SCAS; Spence, 1997), and further allocated to a peer group comprising of 3 'healthy' (non-anxious) and 3 'at risk' (high anxious) children. Prior to and following a peer discussion, participants completed a standardised self-report measure of threat interpretation and response plans to two ambiguous vignettes (Barrett, Rapee, Dadds, &amp; Ryan, 1996; Dadds, Barrett, Rapee, &amp; Ryan, 1996). Results showed all participants evidenced changes in threat interpretation and response plans following the discussion with peers (p  &lt; .001). Overall, findings highlight the potential importance of peer interaction in the development of anxiety-related cognition and behaviour. The findings of study one have important implications for the future development of school-based intervention programs; specifically those conducted in the classroom. Study two sought to advance the current research on preventive intervention for child anxiety by establishing the age at which youngsters benefit the most from the FRIENDS program as a classroom-based universal intervention. Study two presents the results of a longitudinal study evaluating the effects of a universal school-based intervention for child anxiety at two developmental stages. The study involved a cohort of 733 children enrolled in grade 6 (n = 336, 45.6%) aged between 9 and 10 years, and grade 9 (n = 401, 54.4%) aged between 14 and 16 years, Participants were allocated to either a school-based cognitive behavioural intervention or to a monitoring group. Participants completed standardised measures of anxiety, depression and coping style. Participants identified as 'at risk' of an anxiety disorder were assessed for a clinical diagnosis with a structured diagnostic interview. Results indicated the universal intervention effective in significantly reducing anxiety (p &lt; .001), depression (p  &lt; .001) and behaviour avoidance in children at post- intervention and 12-month follow-up intervals. Grade 6 children reported significantly higher anxiety at pre-intervention and greater reductions in anxiety at post intervention compared with the grade 9 (p &lt; .001), although both primary and secondary school participants showed equal reductions in anxiety at 12-month follow up. Overall, findings suggest universal intervention potentially successful in reducing symptoms of anxiety and increasing coping skills in children. Primary school children reported the greatest changes in anxiety symptoms, suggesting earlier preventive intervention potentially more advantageous than later intervention. Developmental differences in anxiety, depression and coping strategies are discussed in addition to the implications and limitations of this study and directions for future research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anxiety</field><field name="subject">anxious</field><field name="subject">disorder</field><field name="subject">disorders</field><field name="subject">child</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">childhood</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">preventive</field><field name="subject">FRIENDS program</field><field name="subject">psychotherapy</field><field name="subject">cognitive-behavioural therapy</field><field name="subject">cognitive-behavioral therapy</field><field name="subject">CBT</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040615.140812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Machine Vision as the Primary Sensory Input for Mobile, Autonomous Robots</field><field name="creator">Lovell, Nathan</field><field name="description">Image analysis, and its application to sensory input (computer vision) is a fairly mature field, so it is surprising that its techniques are not extensively used in robotic applications. The reason for this is that, traditionally, robots have been used in controlled environments where sophisticated computer vision was not necessary, for example in car manufacturing. As the field of robotics has moved toward providing general purpose robots that must function in the real world, it has become necessary that the robots be provided with robust sensors capable of understanding the complex world around them. However, when researchers apply techniques previously studied in image analysis literature to the field of robotics, several difficult problems emerge.  In this thesis we examine four reasons why it is difficult to apply work in image analysis directly to real-time, general purpose computer vision applications.  These are: improvement in the computational complexity of image analysis algorithms, robustness to dynamic and unpredictable visual conditions, independence from domain specific knowledge in object recognition and the development of debugging facilities.  This thesis examines each of these areas making several innovative contributions in each area. We argue that, although each area is distinct, improvement must be made in all four areas before vision will be utilised as the primary sensory input for mobile, autonomous robotic applications.  In the first area, the computational complexity of image analysis algorithms, we note the dependence of a large number of high-level processing routines on a small number of low-level algorithms.  Therefore, improvement to a small set of highly utilised algorithms will yield benefits in a large number of applications.  In this thesis we examine the common tasks of image segmentation, edge and straight line detection and vectorisation.  In the second area, robustness to dynamic and unpredictable conditions, we examine how vision systems can be made more tolerant to changes of illumination in the visual scene. We examine the classical image segmentation task and present a method for illumination independence that builds on our work from the first area.  The third area is the reliance on domain-specific knowledge in object recognition.  Many current systems depend on a large amount of hard-coded domainspecific knowledge to understand the world around them. This makes the system hard to modify, even for slight changes in the environment, and very difficult to apply in a different context entirely. We present an XML-based language, the XML Object Definition (XOD) language, as a solution to this problem. The language is largely descriptive instead of imperative so, instead of describing how to locate objects within each image, the developer simply describes the properties of the objects.  The final area is the development of support tools. Vision system programming is extremely difficult because large amounts of data are handled at a very fast rate. If the system is running on an embedded device (such as a robot) then locating defects in the code is a time consuming and frustrating task.  Many development-support applications are available for specific applications.  We present a general purpose development-support tool for embedded, real-time vision systems.  The primary case study for this research is that of Robotic soccer, in the international RoboCup Four-Legged league. We utilise all of the research of this thesis to provide the first illumination-independent object recognition system for RoboCup. Furthermore we illustrate the flexibility of our system by applying it to several other tasks and to marked changes in the visual environment for RoboCup itself.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile</field><field name="subject">Autonomous Robots</field><field name="subject">sensory input</field><field name="subject">computer vision</field><field name="subject">robotic applications</field><field name="subject">robots</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070911.152447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pricing Strategy and the Formation and Evolution of Reference Price Perceptions in New Product Categories</field><field name="creator">Lowe, Benjamin</field><field name="description">This study examines how pioneer and follower pricing strategies affect the formation and evolution of reference price perceptions in new product categories. It contributes to our understanding of pricing new products by integrating two important research streams in the field of marketing - reference price theory and the theory of pioneer brand advantage. This is the first research to address reference price effects for radically new product categories. Prior research has focused solely on products in existing categories, typically in fast moving consumer goods categories. Using three experiments to causally establish the consequences of pioneer and follower pricing strategies on consumer perceptions, three critical research issues are addressed for the first time, consistent with calls for research in the literature: 1. Which reference price do consumers utilise in new product categories? 2. What is the role of consumer confidence in reference price for new product categories? 3. How do reference price perceptions form and evolve as a result of pioneer and follower pricing strategy? In the literature, a frequently cited issue is the fragmented operationalisation of reference price perceptions. With little theory to guide researchers in terms of which measures should be used, experiment 1 provides new theory, finding as hypothesised, that fair price perceptions as opposed to expected price perceptions are more likely to be evoked by consumers for new product categories. Experiment 1 also finds that using consumers' confidence in their reference price beliefs as an additional explanatory variable, does not improve over current reference price models. Overconfidence, a robust consumer behavioural phenomenon (Alba and Hutchinson 2000), might explain this result. Prior research has made several contributions to understanding reference price perceptions in established product categories. However, not much is known about how these reference price perceptions initially form and evolve. Experiments 2 and 3 address this gap by simulating an emerging market and examining the role of pioneership in shaping reference price perceptions. Experiment 2 found the pioneer, due to its perceptual prominence, is able to define the reference price and subsequently define perceptions of value. That is, the value consumers place on a product and their intentions to purchase the product are about the same whether the pioneer follows a penetration (initial low price) or skimming (initial high price) strategy. Experiment 3 extends experiment 2 by examining what happens in the emerging market when a follower brand enters. The follower enters at a large or small discount to the pioneer, and the pioneer completes its penetration or skimming strategy, converging to a 'regular' price. As predicted, the pioneer's initial price frames subsequent price and value perceptions, signifying the importance of the pioneer as a referent brand. Lower initial prices erode value perceptions, whereas higher initial prices substantiate value perceptions. The follower's pricing strategy does not have as much influence as the pioneer's pricing strategy. Other findings from experiment 3 related to reference price theory in general. Specifically, there was strong evidence of an averaging process when forming reference prices. This adds theory to the measurement debate about operationalising reference price as some past price such as last price paid or some average of past prices. Experiment 3 also provides a further measurement contribution by supporting the use of brand specific measures of reference price, rather than category based measures. More generally, because of the causal research design, this thesis provides strong evidence of the use of reference prices in consumer decision making: a key concern emphasised by one of the area's seminal articles (i.e., Kalyanaram and Winer 1995), which stresses the need to provide evidence that consumers actually use reference prices, and not just act as if they do.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pricing strategy</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">fair price</field><field name="subject">price perceptions</field><field name="subject">expected price</field><field name="subject">new product categories</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070221.155102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Contribution of Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory and Family Risk to Dysfuntional Eating and Hazardous Drinking</field><field name="creator">Loxton, Natalie</field><field name="description">This thesis details a continuing body of research investigating the contribution of personality to disordered eating and alcohol abuse in young women. There is growing evidence of high levels of reward sensitivity in women with both disorders, and high levels of punishment sensitivity in dysfunctional eating women. However, it is unlikely that personality alone accounts for the development of such dysfunctional behaviour. Two studies were conducted to further examine the contribution of reward and punishment sensitivity to these disorders. In the first study, 443 university women completed self-report measures of alcohol use, dysfunctional eating, reinforcement sensitivity, parental drinking, family environment and maternal eating. Reward and punishment sensitivity were better predictors of disordered behaviour than family factors, although maternal dysfunctional eating significantly increased the risk of daughters' dysfunctional eating. Punishment sensitive daughters of bulimic mothers reported the highest level of bulimic symptoms themselves. Punishment sensitivity also functioned as a partial pathway variable between family risk and disordered eating. Given the stronger contribution of personality to disordered behaviour, a second study was conducted in which 131 women completed behavioural tasks under conditions of reward and punishment. Performance on a computerised measure of punishment sensitivity was associated with greater levels of dysfunctional eating but not drinking. However, performance on a card-sorting task of reward sensitivity failed to correlate with self-reported reward sensitivity or disordered behaviour. It was concluded that an innate sensitivity to reward increases the risk of disorders characterised by strong approach tendencies, whilst high punishment sensitivity, perhaps due to a chaotic family, increases the risk of dysfunctional eating, particularly daughters of eating disordered mothers.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dysfunctional eating</field><field name="subject">hazardous drinking</field><field name="subject">reinforcement sensitivity theory</field><field name="subject">hereditary behaviour</field><field name="subject">reward and punishment theory</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060112.111417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese Managers in Simulated Conflict on Welfare Benefit: Effects of Past-Relationship, Other's Strategy, Hierarchy, and Stake</field><field name="creator">Ma, Shan</field><field name="description">In a review on conflict strategies, Putnam and Poole (1987) conclude that relationship variables such as organisational position and interdependency account for the most variance in the choice of conflict strategies. Despite these findings, however, there is a general lack of attention to relationship outcomes in conflict management by researchers (Knapp, Putnam, and Davis, 1988). This reflects the strong influence of economic theory in conflict studies as well as a Western perspective in which individual outcomes are emphasised above interpersonal relations (Wall &amp; Callister, 1995). To address this problem, in this thesis I chose to assess the effect of Past-Relationship, Other's-Strategy, Hierarchy, and Stake on Chinese manager's behaviour in simulated conflict over welfare issues. The thesis consists of the following seven chapters. Chapter One, Introduction, identifies the need to address relationship considerations in conflict management, and the PRC Chinese were chosen as subjects for this research because of their emphasis on interpersonal relations. Past-Relationship, Other's-Strategy, and Hierarchy were chosen to represent the ongoing interpersonal relationship in the past, present and future; and Stake was used to represent substantive considerations in conflict. These factors were assessed for their effects on people's use of five conflict modes: Dominating (DO), Compromising (CO), Obliging (OB), Integrating (IN), and Avoiding (AV). Although these five conflict modes are based on a model developed in the West, they are applicable to the Chinese as well despite the recent critics by some authors. The limited research on Chinese interpersonal conflict has over-relied on self-report questionnaires and lacks the context and substance of conflict. To avoid these pitfalls, the current research took an experimental approach to solicit subject response to simulated conflict of interests. Chapter Two, Hypotheses and research design. Five sets of hypotheses were developed. Stake, Past-Relationship, and Other's-Strategy were expected to affect the use of conflict modes in their own respective ways; Hierarchy's effects were to be moderated by Stake; and an interaction between Other's-Strategy, Past-Relationship, and Hierarchy was also expected. To test these hypotheses, three sources of data were collected: behaviour in conflict simulation, behaviour rationales, and cases of real-world conflict. The conflict issues in the simulation were limited to the allocation of welfare benefits. The range of options and potential outcomes were made explicit to the subjects. Hierarchy, Past-Relationship, and Stake were operationalised through 12 conflict scenarios, which were then combined with Other's-Strategy, giving rise to a total of 48 experimental conditions. A total of 384 Chinese managers participated in the conflict simulation. Chapter Three, Conflict Mode Simulation (CMS). This chapter introduces the development of the experimental instrument, the CMS. Based on the analysis of Mode Game (Cosier &amp; Ruble, 1981), the CMS was created as an experimental instrument for research of the five conflict modes in general and for the hypothesis testing in this study in particular. It allows participants five conflict modes to deal with conflict scenarios; the payoffs of different combinations of modes were logically derived; the 3-2-2 settlement structure enables the CMS to accommodate complex behaviour patterns; and the combination of unitary rules with multiple conflict scenarios controls confounding effects, and gives CMS the flexibility for different research topics. Chapter Four, Data collection and analysis of the simulation data, discusses hypothesis testing through the conflict simulation. The data fit the theoretical model satisfactorily in general. The five sets of hypotheses were largely supported by the simulation data. 1) As the Stake increased, the use of DO and IN increased and the use of OB decreased. The use of AV peaked on Medium-Stake issues. 2) Hierarchy strongly affected the use of DO and OB on High-Stake issues, but that effect diminished as Stake decreased and no difference between hierarchy groups was found at the Low-Stake level. 3) The Indebted group used more OB and fewer DO than the Wronged group, but the uses of IN and AV were not related to Past-Relationship. 4) Other's-Strategy affect behaviour through reciprocating, suppressing, promoting, and learning effects. 5) The same mode (Compromsing) used by different people under different situation had different results. It was also shown in post hoc analyses that relationship concerns played important roles even when faced with the rivalry of substantive concerns. Moreover, the negative effect of combative behaviour was stronger than the positive effect of good deed. Several other important behavioural patterns were also discussed. Chapter Five, Analysis of the rationales of CMS behaviour. Twenty-six major rationale themes were reported by subjects to account for their behaviour in CMS. The report of competitive vs. conciliatory themes depended mainly on Past-Relationship and Stake. The Indebted group reported more conciliatory themes and fewer competitive themes than the Wronged group; and the High-Stake group reported more competitive themes and fewer conciliatory themes than the Med/Low-Stake group. Hierarchy's effect on subject rationale was weak. It was also discovered that subject sensitivity towards Past-Relationship shifted according to Stake. The four modes of CO, OB, IN, and AV shared the same pool of conciliatory themes, which distinguished them from DO, but there were important differences among them as well. Chapter Six, Analysis of self-reported cases of conflict. Fifty-two cases of real world conflict comparable to the CMS conflict scenarios were collected. Analysis shows that Past-Relationship, Stake, and Other's-Strategy affected behaviour in these conflict cases in ways in-line with their respective hypotheses. Hierarchy, however, did not show reliable effects on subject behaviour. Subject description on different types of competing enables the in-depth analysis of the DO mode. The nonsymmetrical effects of Past-Relationship, Stake, and Other's-Strategy manifested in CMS are also observed in these real conflict cases. Chapter Seven, Discussion and conclusion. After an overview of the results of hypothesis testing in different data sources, the implications of some particular issues are discussed. 1) Although the two-dimension model fitted the CMS data well when a variety of different conflict situations were assessed together, in particular situations a hierarchical model is more accurate. 2) Evidence from different data sources confirms that relationships in the past, present and future all have a role to play in the conflict of interests. 3) In terms of the relative importance of different factors, Past-Relationship and Other's-Strategy are at least as important as Stake, whereas Hierarchy is the least important in the given situation of this study. 4) The weak effect of Hierarchy reflects the constraint by status ethics (Hwang, 1991), the interdependence between superior and subordinates, and the broader power base of the highly educated subordinates. 5) Although avoidance was perceived positively, it was not used much when specific conflict issues were given. 6) The Conflict Mode Simulation (CMS) has proved to be indispensable for many of the findings in this study, and it has great potential as an experimental tool for research of conflict modes in general. Finally the limitations of this study and the direction of future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese managers</field><field name="subject">management in China</field><field name="subject">manage</field><field name="subject">managerial</field><field name="subject">conflict management</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030226.145822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Burglar decision Making</field><field name="creator">Macintyre, Stuart Dunlop</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how burglars select a target and carry out a crime. The four research questions addressed by the two studies conducted for this thesis are: 1. What are the processes used by burglars to select a target, break in, steal, and distribute the proceeds? 2. What are the crucial decision making cues used to select a target? 3. What is the impact of various cues, cue alternatives, cue order and combinations selected on target attractiveness in a controlled situation? 4. Does age or experience interact with the effect of any cues? The results furnish discussion and increase the understanding and prevention of break and enter (B&amp;E). The research for this thesis was conducted in two studies. For Study One interviews were conducted with fifty persons who attend a methadone clinic. Participants were past heroin users who financed their drug use through the commission of break and enter. Semi-structured interviews were conducted that covered their drug use and criminal involvement. From these interviews a list of seventeen cues was developed - cue 1 (dog), cue 2 (lighting), cue 3 (alarm), cue 4 (occupancy - lights/tv/radio), cue 5 (occupancy - car in driveway), cue 6 (affluence), cue 7 (doors/windows), cue 8 (locks), cue 9 (garage), cue 10 (fence), cue 11 (garden), cue 12 (location), cue 13 (people in the street), cue 14 (neighbourhood watch), cue 15 (weather), cue 16 (inside information) and cue 17 (street type). Participants used these seventeen cues to determine the vulnerability of a target. For Study Two a computer program was developed, in which these seventeen cues were arranged in various combinations, across twenty case studies. The computer program allowed subjects to access as much information about a case study as they needed to make a decision about its attractiveness as a burglary target. A new sample of ninety-six burglars were asked to view the twenty case studies and give each target a rating from '0' (not a B&amp;E opportunity) to '100' (a definite B&amp;E opportunity). Over the twenty case studies, the subjects only accessed one third of the available information to make a decision. The lower the final rating for a ease study the fewer cues were selected. Subjects were quickly deterred if the first one or two selections revealed deterrent alternatives. In contrast, if the initial selections revealed attractive alternatives the subjects were hard to deter even if subsequent cue selections revealed only deterrent alternatives. Four cues - cue 1 (dog), cue 3 (alann), cue 13 (people in the street) and cue 16 (inside information) - accounted for 91.77% of all first selections. Six cues - cue 1 (dog), 3 (alarm), cue 4 (occupancy - lights/tv/radio), cue 5 (occupancy - car in driveway), cue 13 (people in the street) and cue 16 (inside information) - accounted for 67.8% of all selections made. Clearly these six cues are very important to offenders and they should be closely examined in any prevention initiative. Results revealed that on 282 Occasions subjects viewed only one cue then made their decision based on this one piece of information. The most common single cue was reliable inside information that there was a large amount of cash inside the house or when a good alarm was present. Decision trees were developed which graphically trace the selections of subjects and the ratings given after each selection. The trees showed that subjects reached different conclusions from the same case study because they could select different cues. The selection of different cues from the same case study led to great variation in subsequent cue selections. The decision trees confirmed the earlier finding that subjects are much harder to deter when the first one or two selections had attractive alternatives even if subsequent selections had deterrent alternatives. Results of linear regressions revealed that every cue was significant as predictor of final rating at least twice, however three cues - cue 3 (alarm), cue 12 (location) and cue 16 (inside information) - were significant as predictors ten or more times. The 96 subjects were divided into four groups on the basis of age (young and old) and experience (experienced and inexperienced). The young and inexperienced group used an average of 188.3 cues across the twenty case studies, whereas the older and experienced group used an average of 43.8 cues. Older and experienced subjects were harder to deter, compared to younger and inexperienced subjects. As experience increased fewer cues were needed to reach a decision. The results showed that the variation in final rating for each case study was explained by a few cues. For example, in case study 16 the Adjusted R Square with all seventeen factors entered was .945. With only six cues as predictors the Adjusted R Square reduced slightly to .939. This shows that although cues are mentioned in the literature and were selected by subjects in this study they were often ineffectual and did not assist in explaining the final rating. The two most effective prevention measures were the deterrent alternatives for cue 3 (alarm) and cue 4 (occupancy -lights/tv/radio). The two most influential attractive alternatives were for cue 12 (location; house is located on a corner block) and cue 16 (inside information; from a reliable source you are told there could be a large amount of cash kept in the house). Overall, the linear models with interactions showed that the inexperienced subjects' decision making was more volatile and fluctuated to a greater extent than the experienced subjects' decision making. When continually attractive infonnation was received the inexperienced subjects' ratings climbed higher than did the experienced subjects. When deterrent information was received the negative effect on the inexperienced subjects' ratings was greater than the effect on experienced subjects. Experience increases burglars' skills and abilities but it also improves their capacity to weigh up information in a more reasoned manner. The results revealed that experienced subjects have probably developed a level of skill to the extent that the deterrent alternatives for many cues have become ineffectual. The experienced subjects have developed strategies to overcome many deterrents. The decision making of the experienced subjects was clearly more sophisticated and considered. The main theoretical finding of this thesis is that research will only produce incomplete findings if it concentrates on place and situation to the neglect of the offender and the antecedents and attributes they bring to a crime. The influence of age and experience on decision making is of such consequence that it must be considered to maximise the prevention of crime. Age and experience have individual and combined influences on cue selection and interpretation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Burglar's decision making</field><field name="subject">crime</field><field name="subject">committing crime</field><field name="subject">crime analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050916.165104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fabric of Art: Investigating the Relationships of Power Between Fabric &amp; Fine Art Through Frank Stella's 'Black Paintings' (1958-1960)</field><field name="creator">Mackenzie, Jewel</field><field name="description">There are two inter-related parts to the hypothesis explored in this research. The first is that it is significant to employ fabric as a medium in a fine art context, and the second aspect argues that female artists who choose fabric as their medium should be recognised as 'artists' rather than as crafts practitioners. I propose that in choosing fabric as a medium and sewing as my method of making art, I am working within the framework of contemporary fine art practice. In his essay 'To Cut is to Think' Germano Celant succinctly described the 'cut' made by artists who choose cutting as their process: The cut of the scissor is like the click of a camera or the whirr of a movie camera, like a stroke of the pencil or paintbrush: all these acts decisively isolate a form or representation, marking a surface that generates a reality. The cut puts an end to the traditional representation of the image, dissolving it and then restoring it as a testimony to the artist's vision and understanding.  In this light, the cut confers meaning, and its use unites artists, photographers, designers and tailors, who cut their visions from the magma of their materials, whether these be colour or bronze, fabric or film, metal or wool, wood or canvas (1996, p. 31). My own use of the cut, as the bespoke tailor, reinterpreted fabric as paint and utilized pinstriped fabric as a visual metaphor for relationships of power, pink satin as a symbol of the female inclusion and Frank Stella's Black Paintings as a tool to position my work. Therefore, I would claim that I am working towards a conceptual repositioning of fabric as a medium in fine art.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fabric in fine art</field><field name="subject">Frank Stella</field><field name="subject">fabric as a medium</field><field name="subject">sewing as fine art</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060802.144424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women as Farm Partners: Agricultural Decision Support Systems in the Australian Cotton Industry</field><field name="creator">Mackrell, Dale Carolyn</field><field name="description">Australian farmers are supplementing traditional practices with innovative strategies in an effort to survive recent economic, environmental, and social crises in the rural sector.  These innovative strategies include moving towards a technology-based farm management style.  A review of past literature determines that, despite a growing awareness of the usefulness of computers for farm management, there is concern over the limited demand for computer-based agricultural decision support systems (DSS).  Recent literature indicates that women are the dominant users of computers on family farms yet are hesitant to use computers for decision support, and it is also unclear what decision-making roles women assume on family farms.  While past research has investigated the roles of women in the Australian rural sector, there is a dearth of research into the interaction of women cotton growers with computers.  Therefore, this dissertation is an ontological study and aims to contribute to scholarly knowledge in the research domain of Australian women cotton growers, agricultural DSS, and cotton farm management. This dissertation belongs in the Information Systems (IS) stream and describes an interpretive single case study which explores the lives of Australian women cotton growers on family farms and the association of an agricultural DSS with their farm management roles.  Data collection was predominantly through semi-structured interviews with women cotton growers and cotton industry professionals such as DSS developers, rural extension officers, researchers and educators, rural experimental scientists, and agronomists and consultants, all of whom advise cotton growers.  The study was informed by multiple sociological theories with opposing paradigmatic assumptions: Giddens' (1984) structuration theory as a metatheory to explore the recursiveness of farm life and technology usage; Rogers' (1995) diffusion of innovations theory with a functionalist approach to objectively examine the features of the software and user, as well as the processes of technology adoption; and Connell's (2002) theory of gender relations with its radical humanist perspective to subjectively investigate the relationships between farm partners through critical enquiry. The study was enriched further by drawing on other writings of these authors (Connell 1987; Giddens 2001; Rogers 2003) as well as complementary theories by authors (Orlikowski 1992; Orlikowski 2000; Trauth 2002; Vanclay &amp; Lawrence 1995).  These theories in combination have not been used before, which is a theoretical contribution of the study. The agricultural DSS for the study was CottonLOGIC, an advanced farm management tool to aid the management of cotton production.  It was developed in the late 1990s by the CSIRO and the Australian Cotton Cooperative Research Centre (CRC), with support from the Cotton Research and Development Corporation (CRDC).  CottonLOGIC is a software package of decision support and record-keeping modules to assist cotton growers and their advisors in the management of cotton pests, soil nutrition, and farm operations.  It enables the recording and reporting of crop inputs and yields, insect populations (heliothis, tipworm, mirids and so on), weather data, and field operations such as fertiliser and pesticide applications, as well as the running of insect density prediction (heliothis and mites) and soil nutrition models. The study found that innovative practices and sustainable solutions are an imperative in cotton farm management for generating an improved triple bottom line of economic, environmental and social outcomes.  CottonLOGIC is an industry benchmark for supporting these values through the incorporation of Best Management Practices (BMP) and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) principles, although there were indications that the software is in need of restructuring as could be expected of software over five years old.  The evidence from the study was that women growers are participants in strategic farm decisions but less so in operational decisions, partly due to their lack of relevant agronomic knowledge.  This hindered their use of CottonLOGIC, despite creative attempts to modify it. The study endorsed the existence of gender differences and inequalities in rural Australia.  Nevertheless, the study also found that the women are valued for their roles as business partners in the multidisciplinary nature of farm management.  All the same, there was evidence that greater collaboration and cooperation by farm partners and advisors would improve business outcomes.  On the whole, however, women cotton growers are not passive agents but take responsibility for their own futures.  In particular, DSS tools such as CottonLOGIC are instrumental in enabling women cotton growers to adapt to, challenge, and influence farm management practices in the family farm enterprise, just as CottonLOGIC is itself shaped and reshaped. Hence, a practical contribution of this study is to provide non-prescriptive guidelines for the improved adoption of agricultural DSS, particularly by rural women, as well as increasing awareness of the worth of their roles as family farm business partners.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian cotton industry</field><field name="subject">women farmers</field><field name="subject">agricultural decision support systems</field><field name="subject">family farms</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070305.131533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invading the Spaces: Regulated Empathy, Managerial Control and Alienation in Two Government Agencies</field><field name="creator">Maconachie, Glenda Jo-Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the transformation of work in two public sector organisations, the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security. The analysis considers the impact of organisational and technological change on operational staff at Administrative Service Officer 3 level within these agencies. The relationship between these changes, managerial control and the degree of alienation experienced by staff is highlighted. Considerable transformation of the labour process of workers in both organisations is evident. The most significant cause of these transformations has been facilitated by new technology. New technology has facilitated the reorganisation of work and permitted government policies to reorient the focus of these agencies. In both, a more professional relationship is being fostered between clients and staff, not only through government programs but also through a quality service emphasis. A close relationship between clients and public servants was contrary to all traditional notions of bureaucracy, where impersonality and impartiality are highlighted. This change in focus has been facilitated in the CES by circumstances which rendered newer staff unprepared in the face of increasing client numbers, inadequate training and constantly changing government policy. Staff under these circumstances resorted to empathetic behaviours and emotional labour to offset their deficiencies. These behaviours have now been incorporated into organisational practices. The emotional labour has become regulated empathy. In the DSS regulated empathy has been imposed upon staff as an outcome of new technology facilitating job redesign, and government policy requirements. The utilisation of emotional labour in the DSS is in an embryonic stage consistent with it having been imposed upon workers who were previously all but invisible to their clients. Regulated empathy is argued to be a new type of managerial control in the public sector, incorporating aspects of the worker's personality into the wage-effort bargain. Management has invaded spaces which were once private and has incorporated these into the labour process. Furthermore, it is concluded that the incorporation of these aspects into the wage-effort bargain has the potential to create incompatibilities between constructed work identities and non-work identities, resulting in psychological harm to workers.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regulated empathy</field><field name="subject">managerial control</field><field name="subject">bureaucracy</field><field name="subject">transformational change</field><field name="subject">empathy</field><field name="subject">job design</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050831.113753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sialylmimetics as Potential Inhibitors fo Vibrio Cholerae Sialidase</field><field name="creator">Mann, Maretta  Clare</field><field name="description">Cholera is an epidemic infectious diarrhoeal disease that for centuries has proven its frightening ability to cause rapid and widespread loss of human life. All symptoms associated with cholera are a result of rapid dehydration due to infection by pathogenic strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The damaging effects associated with cholera are mainly attributed to the toxin, which is secreted by the bacterium and infects cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. A sialidase, also secreted by the bacterium, is believed to facilitate toxin uptake by the gastrointestinal epithelium. V. cholerae sialidase is therefore a potential target for therapeutic intervention. A survey of the literature reveals that sialidases from different species share common features with respect to their structure, substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism. The unsaturated sialic acid, Neu5Ac2en, inhibits most exosialidases with a dissociation constant of inhibitor of -10-4 to-10-6 M and has frequently been used as a template in the design of more potent sialidase inhibitors. In the case of V. cholerae sialidase, there have been no inhibitors reported to date that are significantly more potent than Neu5Ac2en itself The present research aimed to develop a range of mimics of Neu5Ac2en, which contain various substituents to replace the C-6 glycerol side chain, as potential inhibitors of V cholerae sialidase. The x-ray crystal structure of V cholerae sialidase was used to explore potential interactions between active site residues and C-6 modified Neu5Ac2en mimetics of known inhibitory potency. Opportunities for interactions within the glycerol side chain pocket in the active site of V cholerae sialidase are discussed. A novel synthetic strategy was developed for the synthesis of a series of glucuronidebased Neu5Ac2en mimetics starting from readily available GIcNAc. This approach was employed for the preparation of Neu5Ac2en mimetics that contained an ether or thioether substituent as replacement of the glycerol side chain of Neu5Ac2en. Progress was also made towards the synthesis of a series of C-6 acylamino Neu5Ac2en mimetics. Analysis by 1H NMR spectroscopy showed that the acylamino derivatives adopted a half-chair conformation that was similar to the conformation of Neu5Ac2en but different to the conformation adopted by the ether and thioether derivatives prepared. The inhibitory activity of the C-6 ether and thioether Neu5Ac2en mimetics prepared was evaluated in vitro using an enzyme assay. It was found that most of the derivatives inhibited V. cholerae sialidase with a K1 of approximately 1O-4 M. The derivatives containing a hydrophobic side chain were found to be slightly more potent compared to derivatives with more hydrophilic side chains. A more detailed study of binding interactions between the C-6 thioether Neu5Ac2en mimetics and V cholerae sialdiase was carried out using STD 1H NMR spectroscopy and computational molecular modelling.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sialylmimetics</field><field name="subject">cholera</field><field name="subject">v. cholerae sialidase</field><field name="subject">dissociation constant of inhibitor</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061006.083947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Influencing the Composition of Faunal Assemblages in Rainforest Stream Pools</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Jonathan Coid</field><field name="description">Previous research has shown that a range of physical and biological drivers can influence the composition of faunal assemblages occupying localities within streams.  There is much debate in the literature about which of these is more important.  Descriptive and experimental field studies were conducted in two relatively undisturbed, second order rainforest streams in southeast Queensland, Australia.  The principal objectives were to describe spatial and temporal patterns in pool fauna and explore relationships between these patterns and physical attributes of habitat, disturbance and biotic interactions. The macroinvertebrate and vertebrate fauna of 12 small stream pools were sampled approximately monthly over a period of 15 months.  Samples were collected from all major within-pool habitat types and concurrent measurements of potentially important environmental parameters were made at landscape scales of stream, pool and habitat patch.  Faunal assemblages were consistently different between the two streams and between the various within-pool habitat types, although the latter may partially be explained by differences in sampling protocols applied in the different habitat types.  However, spatial and temporal variation in faunal assemblages within habitat types was large at the scales of whole pools and within-pool habitats, and this variation occurred apparently independently of variation in physical habitat attributes.  These results indicated that very little of the local scale faunal variation could be explained by abiotic drivers and that some other factors must be responsible for the observed faunal patterns. Previous research had indicated that atyid shrimps can play a significant ecological role in rainforest streams, where they act as 'ecosystem engineers' by removing fine sediment from hard surfaces.  This subsequently alters algal dynamics and faunal composition in streams.  A pool-scale manipulative experiment was conducted to investigate the role of the atyid Paratya australiensis, which is an abundant and conspicuous component of the fauna.  Removal of shrimp from pools had no effect on sediment accrual on hard surfaces and consequently did not affect algal biomass or faunal assemblages.  The lack of effect on sediment accumulation was attributed to the low rate of deposition in these streams, which was an order of magnitude lower than in streams where atyids have been demonstrated to play a keystone role. The fish Mogurnda adspersa was found to be the primary predator of pool fauna in the study streams, where it preyed on a wide variety of taxa.  Dietary analyses revealed that an ontogenetic shift occurred in both diet and the within-pool habitat where fish fed.  Within this general framework, individual fish had strong individual prey preferences.  Significant correlations were found between the natural abundance of Mogurnda in pools and faunal assemblage patterns in both gravel habitat and pools in general, indicating that predation had an effect on pool fauna.  The nature of this effect varied between habitats.  A direct density dependent response was observed in gravel habitat.  In contrast, the response in pools varied considerably between individual pools, perhaps reflecting the differing prey preferences of individual fish.  Despite these correlations, an experimental manipulation of the density of Mogurnda at a whole-pool scale did not conclusively identify a predation effect.  This may have been due to problems with fish moving between treatments, despite attempts to constrain them, and low experimental power due to the inherent high variability of pool fauna. Overall, the results of the study indicated that there was considerable spatial and temporal variation in pool fauna despite similarities in the physical attributes of pools and their close proximity.  This variation appeared to occur at random and could not be explained by abiotic or biotic factors.  Predation had a small effect, but could not explain the overall patterns, whereas disturbance by spates had very little effect at all.  Stochastic processes associated with low level random recruitment were identified as a possible and plausible explanation for observed patterns.  These conclusions are discussed in terms of their implications for our understanding of the ecology and management of streams.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rain forest</field><field name="subject">rainforest</field><field name="subject">stream</field><field name="subject">streams</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">pool fauna</field><field name="subject">stream fauna</field><field name="subject">faunal assemblages</field><field name="subject">southeast Queensland</field><field name="subject">Paratya australiensis</field><field name="subject">Mogurnda adspersa</field><field name="subject">fish</field><field name="subject">fishes</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040218.150407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Employee Adjustment During Organisational Change: The Role of Climate, Organisational Level and Occupation</field><field name="creator">Martin, Angela Jayne</field><field name="description">The present studies were designed to advance theoretical understanding of employee adjustment during organisational change.  There were two broad aims of the thesis.  Firstly, the role of organisational climate factors in facilitating employee adjustment during change was examined by testing models based on Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) cognitive-phenomenological account of stress and coping processes.  In particular, the concept of coping resources was expanded to examine organisational factors rather than individual attributes.  Secondly, the extent to which organisational sub-groups differ in their perceptions of climate and levels of adjustment indicators during change was investigated.  The research also aimed to inform diagnostic processes within organisational change management by examining the applied value of the empirical findings of each of the studies. The first two studies were empirical tests of a theoretical model of employee adjustment.  Study 1 tested a model of employee adjustment to organisational change that examined employee well-being and job satisfaction as outcomes of positive adjustment during change.  Firstly, pilot interviews with 67 hospital employees enabled salient aspects of the organisational climate that may facilitate adjustment during organisational change to be confirmed.  Next, 779 employees in the same organisation completed a structured questionnaire that examined their perceptions of organisational coping resources, appraisals of change and adjustment indicators.  Confirmatory factor analyses established the sound measurement properties of the proposed model and structural equation analyses provided evidence that supported the majority of theoretical predictions.  Overall, the final model showed that employees who had positive perceptions about employee relations within the hospital, strong beliefs about the quality of patient care, and felt supported by their supervisors were more positive in their appraisals of the change and reported better personal adjustment.  The effects of climate variables on adjustment were direct and indirect (mediated by change appraisals).  A particularly influential variable in the model was the effectiveness of employee relations within the organisation.  Study 2 tested a model of employee adjustment to organisational change which examined organisational commitment, turnover intentions and absenteeism as outcomes of positive adjustment during change.  Firstly, as in Study 1, pilot interviews with 20 state public sector employees enabled salient elements of the organisational climate that may function as resources for coping with organisational change to be confirmed.  Next, 877 employees in the same organisation completed a structured questionnaire that examined their perceptions of organisational coping resources, appraisals of change and adjustment indicators.  Like Study 1, confirmatory factor analyses established the sound measurement properties of the proposed model and structural equation analyses provided evidence which supported most of the theoretical predictions.  Overall, the final model showed that employees who had positive perceptions about customer service, believed that their leaders communicated a vision for the organisation, and felt supported by their supervisors were more positive in their appraisals of the change and reported better personal adjustment.  The effects of climate variables on adjustment were direct and indirect (mediated by change appraisals).  The extent to which leaders exhibited a vision for the organisation emerged as an important predictor in the model.  Together, the results of studies 1 and 2 provided evidence that organisational climate variables are important predictors of the way employees appraise and respond to organisation change.  The next two studies presented were focused on group differences in the model variables from studies 1 and 2.  Study 3 investigated group differences in perceptions of climate and levels of adjustment during organisational change as a function of an employee's organisational level.  The pilot interviews revealed that an employee's organisational level was the most salient source of sub-group identification in the climate of a public sector department.  Survey data from study 2 were analysed using Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA).  The responses of 669 public sector employees were grouped into 3 categories: lower, middle and upper level employees.  Results revealed that upper level staff reported higher levels of adjustment during change, across a range of indicators.  Study 4 investigated occupational group and organisational level differences in perceptions of climate and levels of adjustment during organisational change.  The pilot interviews in this organisation revealed that it was an employee's occupational group membership that provided the most salient group delineator in the hospital climate.  Survey data from Study 1 were analysed using MANOVA.  The responses of 732 hospital employees were grouped into 4 major occupational categories: medical, nursing, allied health and non-clinical staff.  Participants were also grouped on the basis of whether they occupied a management or non-management position.  Results revealed statistically significant differences between groups and an interaction between occupation and level.  Non-clinical staff were less well adjusted during change than other occupational groups.  Managers appraised change as more stressful than non-managers, but felt more in control of the situation.  Together, the results of Studies 3 and 4 highlighted the importance of examining employee perceptions at the sub-group level when implementing change and indicated the need for interventions to be targeted at the sub-group level.  Overall, the research reported in this dissertation extended a theoretical model of employee adjustment to change and improved the application of the model.  This outcome was achieved by investigating the role of environmental coping resources drawn from the organisational climate in improving employee adjustment during change and the degree to which groups differed in their perceptions of these variables.  Climate and change appraisal factors were linked with a range of important individual/organisational outcomes such as employee well-being, job satisfaction, organisational commitment, turnover intentions and absenteeism.  Differences in perceptions of climate and levels of adjustment during change were also observed at the organisational sub-group level.  The findings of the research have implications for the effective management of organisational change.  Change should be implemented in conjunction with ongoing organisational development processes involving diagnostic research that identifies the elements of climate that employees draw upon for support in the process of adjustment.  Interventions should be based on improving and strengthening these resources.  Diagnostic processes should also pay attention to the salient groupings of staff within an organisation so that interventions can be targeted specifically to relevant sub-groups.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational change</field><field name="subject">organizational change</field><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">employee adjustment</field><field name="subject">organisational climate</field><field name="subject">organizational climate</field><field name="subject">job level</field><field name="subject">work level</field><field name="subject">occupations</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031003.090413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Audit Committee and Internal Audit Attributes on Internal Audit Contribution to Financial Statement Audits and Audit Fees: Perceptions of Malaysian Internal Auditors</field><field name="creator">Mat Zain, Mazlina</field><field name="description">This thesis has two (2) broad objectives. The first objective is to test the impact of audit committee and internal audit (IA) function characteristics on IA contribution to the financial statement audit. The second objective is to investigate whether a negative association exists between IA contribution to the financial statement audit and audit fees.  The study is conducted in a Malaysian context and focuses on the perspectives of internal auditors. There are a number of motivations for the study.  In particular, previous studies have not addressed the need for a better understanding of how corporate governance mechanisms such as audit committee and IA unit attributes may affect IA contribution to the financial statement audit.  Also, the results of prior studies on the link between IA contribution to the financial statement audit and audit fees are mixed and inconclusive.  Furthermore, there is limited empirical evidence in this area from emerging economy countries, with relatively less developed capital markets such as Malaysia. The underlying theme throughout this thesis is that corporate governance mechanisms i.e., audit committee and IA characteristics have the potential to affect the efficiency of the IA unit thus leading to greater contribution of IA to financial statement audits. Specifically, the thesis argues that certain characteristics of audit committees such as the independence of audit committee members from the management, audit committee members' experience and knowledge in accounting, auditing and finance and their level of interactions with the chief internal auditor have the potential to increase the contribution of IA work to financial statement audits. Likewise, it is also postulated that characteristics of the IA function such as their size and prior experience of their staff in auditing are likely to improve the level of efficiency and hence, encourage greater contribution of IA to the external audit work.  Finally, due to the saturation of the audit services market coupled with significant competition among public accounting firms, it is also predicted that the contribution of IA work is increasingly viewed as a potential means of improving external audit efficiency (i.e. by reducing time and effort), leading to lower audit fees.  Seven (7) hypotheses are tested in this study based on Malaysian data during 2003. Data collection adopted a multi approach with three (3) key sources of data: a questionnaires survey, in-depth interviews and publicly available data from annual reports. The data collection process involved a mail survey addressed to the chief internal auditors of companies listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) Main Board.  Five-hundred and two questionnaires (502) were mailed and a total of 101 (20.03%) responses were returned, of which 76 (17.9%) were useable. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 chief internal auditors selected from various industries which were also listed on the KLSE Main Board. Finally, publicly available data from annual reports were utilized. The study makes a number of contributions. First, it provides empirical evidence on the impact of audit committee characteristics on IA contribution to financial statement audits. In particular, the study supports a positive relationship between IA contribution to the financial statement audit and three (3) dimensions of audit committee characteristics namely the proportion of independent audit committee members, the extent of audit committee members' experience and knowledge in auditing, accounting and finance, and the frequency of meetings between the chief internal auditor and the audit committee.  This suggests that a high proportion of independent audit committee members with experience and knowledge in accounting, auditing and finance is able to enhance the efficacy of the IA function and thus, encourages external auditors to rely more on the IA function.  The results support the earlier predictions that more frequent meetings conducted between audit committees and the chief internal auditor leads to higher extent of IA contribution to the financial statement audit. Further, findings of this study also provides support for the positive relationship between the characteristics of the IA function, namely the size of the IA function and the proportion of staff with prior experience in auditing and IA contribution to the financial statement audit.  The results suggest that internal auditors contribute more to the financial statement audit when the size of the IA function is larger and when the proportion of IA staff with prior experience in auditing is higher. Finally, the second model tests for a negative relationship between IA contribution to the financial statement audit and audit fees. However, the results did not yield a significant relationship between these two variables. Further clarifications for this result were derived from the interviews with the chief internal auditors. Specifically, it appears that any saving in time and effort due to the contribution of IA to financial statement audits may possibly be used by external auditors to expand their investigations into other more complex areas that require greater attention from them. Other findings from the interviews also suggest that audit committees play an important role as communication facilitators between the IA staff and management, especially by providing a candid forum for IA staff to express their opinions as well as supporting IA staff's recommendations based on their findings during audit investigations. Further, the leadership role of the audit committee also tends to assist the internal auditors to better communicate with management and to ensure that management will act upon the internal auditor's recommendations. In conclusion, the findings may have some implications for regulators and others concerned with establishing guidelines and listing rules pertaining to audit committee effectiveness especially in developing countries. Furthermore, this study also contributes to the literature on how an IA unit's resourcing has implications for IA contribution to the financial statement audit. While the current professional standards (i.e., ISA 610, SAS 65, and AUS 604) view IA as a substitute for external audit, such professional standards also require external auditors to evaluate the quality of IA unit before relying on the work of IA or accept the contribution of IA to the financial statement audit. As such, this study provides evidence on the potential impact that audit committees and IA units may have on such contribution of IA to the financial statement audit.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internal audit (Malaysia)</field><field name="subject">audit committee</field><field name="subject">financial statement audit (Malaysia)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060814.111202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PEX1 Mutations in Australasian Patients with Disorders of Peroxisome Biogenesis</field><field name="creator">Maxwell, Megan Amanda</field><field name="description">The peroxisome is a subcellular organelle that carries out a diverse range of metabolic functions, including the b-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids, the breakdown of peroxide and the a-oxidation of fatty acids. Disruption of peroxisome metabolic functions leads to severe disease in humans. These diseases can be broadly grouped into two categories: those in which a single enzyme is defective, and those known as the peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), which result from a generalised failure to import peroxisomal matrix proteins (and consequently result in disruption of multiple metabolic pathways). The PBDs result from mutations in PEX genes, which encode protein products called peroxins, required for the normal biogenesis of the peroxisome. PEX1 encodes an AAA ATPase that is essential for peroxisome biogenesis, and mutations in PEX1 are the most common cause of PBDs worldwide. This study focused on the identification of mutations in PEX1 in an Australasian cohort of PBD patients, and the impact of these mutations on PEX1 function. As a result of the studies presented in this thesis, twelve mutations in PEX1 were identified in the Australasian cohort of patients. The identified mutations can be broadly grouped into three categories: missense mutations, mutations directly introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) and mutations that interrupt the reading frame of PEX1. The missense mutations that were identified were R798G, G843D, I989T and R998Q; all of these mutations affect amino acid residues located in the AAA domains of the PEX1 protein. Two mutations that directly introduce PTCs into the PEX1 transcript (R790X and R998X), and four frameshift mutations (A302fs, I370fs, I700fs and S797fs) were identified. There was also one mutation found in an intronic region (IVS22-19A&gt;G) that is presumed to affect splicing of the PEX1 mRNA. Three of these mutations, G843D, I700fs and G973fs, were found at high frequency in this patient cohort. At the commencement of these studies, it was hypothesised that missense mutations would result in attenuation of PEX1 function, but mutations that introduced PTCs, either directly or indirectly, would have a deleterious effect on PEX1 function. Mutations introducing PTCs are thought to cause mRNA to be degraded by the nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA (NMD) pathway, and thus result in a decrease in PEX1 protein levels. The studies on the cellular impact of the identified PEX1 mutations were consistent with these hypotheses. Missense mutations were found to reduce peroxisomal protein import and PEX1 protein levels, but a residual level of function remained. PTC-generating mutations were found to have a major impact on PEX1 function, with PEX1 mRNA and protein levels being drastically reduced, and peroxisomal protein import capability abolished. Patients with two missense mutations showed the least impact on PEX1 function, patients with two PTC-generating mutations had a severe defect in PEX1 function, and patients carrying a combination of a missense mutation and a PTC-generating mutation showed levels of PEX1 function that were intermediate between these extremes. Thus, a correlation between PEX1 genotype and phenotype was defined for the Australasian cohort of patients investigated in these studies. For a number of patients, mutations in the coding sequence of one PEX1 allele could not be identified. Analysis of the 5' UTR of this gene was therefore pursued for potential novel mutations. The initial analyses demonstrated that the 5' end of PEX1 extended further than previously reported. Two co-segregating polymorphisms were also identified, termed &#150;137 T&gt;C and &#150;53C&gt;G. The -137T&gt;C polymorphism resided in an upstream, in-frame ATG (termed ATG1), and the possibility that the additional sequence represented PEX1 coding sequence was examined. While both ATGs were found to be functional by virtue of in vitro and in vivo expression investigations, Western blot analysis of the PEX1 protein in patient and control cell extracts indicated that physiological translation of PEX1 was from the second ATG only. Using a luciferase reporter approach, the additional sequence was found to exhibit promoter activity. When examined alone the -137T&gt;C polymorphism exerted a detrimental effect on PEX1 promoter activity, reducing activity to half that of wild-type levels, and the -53C&gt;G polymorphism increased PEX1 promoter activity by 25%. When co-expressed (mimicking the physiological condition) these polymorphisms compensated for each other to bring PEX1 promoter activity to near wild-type levels. The PEX1 mutations identified in this study have been utilised by collaborators at the National Referral Laboratory for Lysosomal, Peroxisomal and Related Genetic Disorders (based at the Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide), in prenatal diagnosis of the PBDs. In addition, the identification of three common mutations in Australasian PBD patients has led to the implementation of screening for these mutations in newly referred patients, often enabling a precise diagnosis of a PBD to be made. Finally, the strong correlation between genotype and phenotype for the patient cohort investigated as part of these studies has generated a basis for the assessment of newly identified mutations in PEX1.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peroxisome</field><field name="subject">peroxisomes</field><field name="subject">PBD</field><field name="subject">PBDs</field><field name="subject">peroxisome biogenesis disorder</field><field name="subject">peroxisomal matrix proteins</field><field name="subject">PEX genes</field><field name="subject">PEX1</field><field name="subject">mutation</field><field name="subject">mutations</field><field name="subject">missense mutation</field><field name="subject">missense mutations</field><field name="subject">PTC mutation</field><field name="subject">PTC mutations</field><field name="subject">premature termination codon</field><field name="subject">polymorphism</field><field name="subject">polymorphisms</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040219.100649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internal+/-External Terrains: A Meditation On the Productive Skein of Electracy</field><field name="creator">Maybury, Terrence</field><field name="description">Internal+/-External Terrains is a meditation on the nature of electronic creativity, primarily from a production point of view.  It seeks to arbitrate and synthesise a range of skills, attributes and ideas that might constitute the field of electronic aesthetics.  It does this from the perspective of electronic artists, and the socio/economic/cultural system they increasingly serve. The aesthetics of electronic production, as looked at through the framework of electracy, serves as a model through which to locate some specific shifts in both self-making, and capitalism, in both their Post-Fordist, and globalising manifestations. Internal+/-External Terrains is a meditation on the re-conceptualisation going on in electronic meaning-making, as it is currently happening at the interfaces of the psyche, the politico-cultural domain, and in the techno-aesthetic apparatus of its production. Through the compilation of a possible program in electracy (of its various aesthetic components as used in production), along with a brief outline of the electronic artist, Internal+/-External Terrains situates both, as role-model and epicentre, of an increasingly accepted mode of abstraction: Radial-Logic&#169;.

Regulatory mechanisms controlling the production of lipase and protease by the B52 lipA and aprX genes were investigated. Transposon mutagenesis identified the possible involvement of a poly-A polymerase enzyme which destabilises mRNA by 3' polyadenylation. A homologue of the E. coli EnvZ/OmpR two-component sensor/regulator system was identified by transposon mutagenesis and shown to repress lipase and protease production. This system responds to Na+ and K+ concentration in E. coli and these ions were also shown to repress lipase and protease expression in B52, however the EnvZ/OmpR system is not solely responsible for this. Assays of translational lacZ fusions with aprX and lipA were used to speculate on the mechanism by which Na+ and EnvZ/OmpR repress the aprX-lipA operon. A membrane-bound sensor, MspA, which regulates protease production in P. fluorescens LS107d&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;, was shown to exist in B52 but mutagenesis of the B52 mspA gene had no effect on lipase and protease expression. A homologue of the P. fluorescens CHA0 rsmA gene, encoding an RNA-binding translation repressor, was found in B52. Although aprX and possibly lipA contain consensus sequences for RsmA, mutagenesis of rsmA had no significant effect on lipase and protease expression. Repression of lipase and protease expression by Na+ was increased by expression of the P. fluorescens M114 pbrA sigma-factor gene in B52.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pseudomonas fluorescens</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">psychrotrophic bacteria</field><field name="subject">psychrotrophy</field><field name="subject">lipase</field><field name="subject">protease</field><field name="subject">milk spoilage</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031015.124744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic and Structural Studies on the Novel Formation of Bicyclo[n.2.0]alkan-1-ols</field><field name="creator">McCleary, Michelle Angela</field><field name="description">Reaction of phenyl vinyl sulfoxide with the lithium enolates of simple ketones of varying ring size (cyclopentanone, cycloheptanone and cyclooctanone) under controlled cyclisation conditions followed by subsequent oxidation resulted in the formation of the bicyclo[n.2.0]alkan-1-ols 253-255, 262, 263, 265, 268 and 269 in conjunction with alkylated species 256, 257, 264, 266 and 267. The ratio of bicyclo[n.2.0]alkan-1-ols to alkylated ketone formation observed was dependent on a number of factors including the variation of enolate reactivity between the different ring sizes, conversion of phenyl vinyl sulfoxide, time, temperature and concentration of reaction and the stability and steric strain observed in the final bicyclo[n.2.0]alkan-1-ol product.  X-ray crystal structures of 253, 262 and 265 were obtained and a structural study showed that as the overall steric strain in the bicyclo[n.2.0]alkan-1-ol product is decreased there is a corresponding increase in product distribution in favour of bicyclo[n.2.0]alkan-1-ol formation in conjunction with increased yields.  Selected substituted and functionalised ketones (2-methylcyclopentanone, 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone, 2-methylcyclohexanone and 1,4-cyclohexanedione mono-ethylene ketal) also reacted in the cyclisation reaction to give bicyclo[n.2.0]alkan-1-ols 270, 271, 277, 278, 281, 282, 285 and 286  in conjunction with alkylated products 272, 279, 280, 283, 284 and 287. Incorporation of substitution at the bridgehead and C2 position had a role in the preference of the major stereochemical isomer observed for a bicyclo[n.2.0]alkan-1-ol (n = 3, 4). A structural comparison of the X-ray crystal structures of 278, 281 and 286 indicated that the pseudo chair conformation of the six-membered ring influenced ring torsion and bond angles in the bicyclo[4.2.0]octanol ring system. Two model studies were selected to illustrate the potential application of the cyclisation process as methodology towards natural product synthesis or complex ring systems. No bicyclo[n.2.0]alkan-1-ol formation was evident in an intramolecular example using the starting ketone 291 in which the electrophile is tethered to the ketone. 2,6-Dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one 301 considered as a model study towards the synthesis of the antibiotic mellolide, upon reaction with phenyl vinyl sulfoxide and oxidation displayed poor reactivity. The novel bicyclo[2.2.2]octanones 303, 304 and 305 were formed in very low yields. The lack of reactivity of the ketones 2,6-dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one, 1,2-cyclohexanedione and 1,4-cyclohexanedione towards bicyclo[n.2.0]alkan-1-ol formation suggested that conjugation in the enolate prior to reaction with phenyl vinyl sulfoxide was not favourable. The non-reactivity of these ketones and the hindered ketone camphor indicated the potential limitations to the cyclisation methodology. However, conversion of the ketal functionality of 286 to a ketone resulted in the formation of the functionalised bicyclo[4.2.0]octanol 288 providing positive indications for further synthetic applications.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inorganic chemistry</field><field name="subject">cyclisation</field><field name="subject">ring formation</field><field name="subject">ketones</field><field name="subject">alkanes</field><field name="subject">cycloalkanes</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040520.143342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Experiences of Chinese International Postgraduates Studying in Singapore</field><field name="creator">McClure, Joanne Wendy</field><field name="description">Postgraduate research presents particular challenges to students: self-management, independent research, extended writing, and working with a supervisor. If we add to these challenges those faced by international students - the complexity of a new culture, a new academic culture, and the difficulties of a second language - we begin to see the hurdles that such students must overcome. Postgraduate students are already well socialised into their discipline, its discourse, research, and methodology. However, when students undertake their study abroad, how easily do they 'fit' into their new environment? And in what ways does their previous disciplinary socialisation, clash with, or complement their new academic socialisation? Given the large numbers of Chinese international students studying abroad particularly at postgraduate level, a focus on individual student experiences was seen as important in advancing our understanding of these students' experiences and sensitising international providers of such education to the ways in which they may better respond to such students. The purpose of the study was to examine the experiences of Chinese international postgraduate students studying in Singapore to find out how they perceived their new learning environment, and to explore the coping strategies they employed to manage, understand and construct meaning out of their learning situation. The study also sought to focus on their particular learning needs, given their perception of their environment, and the ways in which higher education providers could best accommodate these needs. A qualitative constructivist methodology was used to examine the learning experiences and coping strategies of 12 Chinese international postgraduates balanced by gender and level of higher degree study involved. The students were interviewed twice over a five-month period, with each interview lasting approximately one hour. The study focused on understanding students' experiences of positive and negative incidents in their learning environment, on the construction of meaning around those incidents, and on students' subsequent responses to them. Potential differences across the variables of level of degree study, gender and marital status were also considered in the analysis. Four major themes were identified in the student experiences those of marginalisation: student/supervisory relationship, academic/organisational marginalisation, social marginalisation, and advantaging. The coping strategies identified are those of self-determination and technique. It was found that adjustment for students was most difficult in the first six to twelve months from entry into the new cultural context, largely due to the influence of previous educational and cultural experiences on expectations. Also highlighted was the range of interpersonal and intrapersonal coping strategies that students used to help manage their cultural transition. The importance of collegial support as a key coping strategy for international student adjustment was confirmed in the study. Self-determination was also shown to be a strong motivator for managing research work and interpersonal relationships. The research indicated a number of important differences between masters and doctoral students' experiences and highlighted differences concerning traditional gender roles. Implications arising from the study may inform intervention programmes that are directed to the points of tension identified in students' experiences. The tensions in student experiences may largely be understood in terms of unrealistic or unfulfilled expectations being brought to the new study context but grounded in the home culture. Addressing these needs may be seen in various ways, including: (1) changing student expectations to make them more realistic; (2) sensitising students in cross-cultural issues; (3) sensitising host university staff in understanding and responding to cross-cultural issues in students; (4) providing appropriate levels of support in dealing with issues as they arise; and (5) structuring opportunities for mutual support by students in the host institution. Further research is indicated into the investigation of the cultural transition experiences and coping strategies of other national or ethnic groups at postgraduate level. Investigation of the experiences of international Chinese students in other disciplines, other host countries, and at other education levels is also indicated.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese students</field><field name="subject">postgraduate students</field><field name="subject">foreign students</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">coping strategies</field><field name="subject">marginalisation</field><field name="subject">marginalization</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040218.082542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Bush Identity on Attitudes to Mental Health in a Queensland Community</field><field name="creator">McColl, Lisa Maree</field><field name="description">The main objectives of this research were to determine the influence of bush identity on attitudes to mental health in rural Australia, what influence these attitudes have on service provision and utilisation, and what measures can be taken to improve attitudes to mental health and services in the bush. The research has included an extensive literature review of Australian historical and contemporary rural culture, the political economy of rural restructuring, rural mental health, as well as State and Federal policies and programmes for mental health care delivery. An ethnographic community study of &#147;Ruraltown&#148;, a rural centre in Queensland, was undertaken over a three-year period which involved semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, observations and community interaction. The results from the questionnaires and interviews in the community study indicate that attitudes to mental health in rural areas are influenced by bush identity, defined by reference to historical and current characteristics which include self-reliance, resilience, independence and stoicism. Social identity theories have been applied in this study to determine how the socialisation processes have incorporated these characteristics among the rural population, and rural males especially. In turn, these incorporated attributes and values have a direct impact on their attitudes to mental health and the willingness to seek help for problems of a psychological nature. Other aspects of rural life such as perceived lack of confidentiality and anonymity, fear of gossip, and isolation also impact on attitudes and the utilisation of mental health resources. Stigma is a significant barrier to recognition and acceptance of mental health issues. Hence, seeking help for mental health problems does not form part of the coping strategies for many in the bush. Mental health services, therefore, are not as readily accepted or utilised in rural Australia. Although some rural people do access mental health services, many more go on suffering with mental health problems rather than addressing them. Recommendations have been made to promote awareness and enhance education and attitudes to mental health, improve services and increase service utilisation. The study has also identified the problems facing mental health consumers in Ruraltown and some suggestions have been made to overcome these and assist in consumer empowerment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental health services(Queensland)</field><field name="subject">rural communities</field><field name="subject">rural culture (Queensland)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060810.121042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision Support System for the Evaluation and Comparison of Concession Project Investments</field><field name="creator">McCowan, Alison Kate</field><field name="description">Governments of developed and developing countries alike are unable to fund the construction and maintenance of vital physical infrastructure such as roads, railways, water and wastewater treatment plants, and power plants. Thus, they are more and more turning to the private sector as a source of finance through procurement methods such as concession contracts. The most common form of concession contract is the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contract, where a government (Principal) grants a private sector company (Promoter) a concession to build, finance, operate and maintain a facility and collect revenue over the concession period before finally transferring the facility, at no cost to the Principal, as a fully operational facility. Theoretically speaking, these projects present a win-win-win solution for the community as well as both private and public sector participants. However, with the opportunity for private sector companies to earn higher returns comes greater risk. This is despite the fact that concession projects theoretically present a win-win-win solution to the problem of infrastructure provision. Unfortunately, this has not been the case in a number of countries including Australia. Private sector participants have admitted that there are problems that must be addressed to improve the process. Indeed they have attributed the underperformance of concession projects to the inability of both project Principals and Promoters to predict the impact of all financial and non-financial (risk) factors associated with concession project investments (CPIs) and to negotiate contracts to allow for these factors. Non-financial project aspects, such as social, environmental, political, legal and market share factors, are deemed to be important; but these aspects would usually be considered to lie outside the normal appraisal process. To allow for the effects of such qualitative aspects, the majority of Principal or promoting organisations resort to estimating the necessary money contingencies without an appropriate quantification of the combined effects of financial and non-financial (risks and opportunities) factors. In extreme cases, neglect of non-financial aspects can cause the failure of a project despite very favourable financial components; or can even cause the failure to go-ahead with a project that may have been of great non-financial benefit due to its projected ordinary returns. Hence, non-financial aspects need careful analysis and understanding so that they can be assessed and properly managed. It is imperative that feasibility studies allow the promoting organisation to include a combination of financial factors and non-financial factors related to the economic environment, project complexity, innovation, market share, competition, and the national significance of the project investment. While much research has already focused on the classification of CPI non-financial (risk) factors, and the identification of interdependencies between risk factors on international projects, no attempt has yet been made to quantify these risk interdependencies. Building upon the literature, this thesis proposes a generic CPI risk factor framework (RFF) including important interdependencies, which were verified and quantified using input provided by practitioners and researchers conversant with risk profiles of international and/or concession construction projects. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) are systems designed to assist in the decision making process by providing all necessary information to the analyst. There are a number of DSSs that have been developed over recent years for the evaluation of high-risk construction project investments, such as CPIs, which incorporate the analysis of both financial and non-financial (risk) aspects of the investment. However, although these DSSs have been useful to practitioners and researchers alike, they have not offered a satisfactory solution to the modelling problem and are all limited in their practical application for various reasons. Thus, the construction industry lacks a DSS that is capable of evaluating and comparing several CPI options, taking into consideration both financial and non-financial aspects of an investment, as well as including the uncertainties commonly encountered at the feasibility stage of a project, in an efficient and effective manner. These two criteria, efficiency and effectiveness, are integral to the usefulness and overall acceptance of the developed DSS in industry. This thesis develops an effective and efficient DSS to evaluate and compare CPI opportunities at the feasibility stage. The novel DSS design is based upon a combination of: (1) the mathematical modelling technique and financial analysis model that captures the true degree of certainty surrounding the project; and (2) the decision making technique and RFF that most closely reproduces the complexity of CPI decisions. Overall, this thesis outlines the methodology followed in the development of the DSS &#150; produced as a stand-alone software product &#150; and demonstrates its capabilities through a verification and validation process using real-life CPI case studies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decision support systems</field><field name="subject">infrastructure</field><field name="subject">projects</field><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">public utilities</field><field name="subject">private sector finance</field><field name="subject">financing</field><field name="subject">concession contracts</field><field name="subject">CPI risk factor framework</field><field name="subject">risk analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050321.123306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of Olfactory Mucosa to Test the Neurodevelopmental Nature of Psychoses</field><field name="creator">McCurdy, Richard D</field><field name="description">Evidence from various sources suggests that schizophrenia may result from altered brain development. The adult olfactory epithelium provides an available 'window' on neuronal development because new neurons are formed there throughout life. This thesis set out to test the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of psychotic disease. Two cell-based models, skin fibroblast and olfactory mucosa culture, were employed to investigate this hypothesis. In order to first demonstrate the utility of olfactory mucosa culture as a model of neurodevelopment, and to allow the candidate to gain proficiency in the culture of this tissue, an investigation of the mitogenic and differentiating properties of insulin-like growth factor-I within this system was undertaken. Insulin-like growth factor-I has multiple effects within the developing nervous system but its role in neurogenesis in the adult nervous system is less clear. The adult olfactory mucosa is a site of continuing neurogenesis that expresses insulin-like growth factor-I, its receptor, and its binding proteins. The action of insulin-like growth factor-I was assayed in several serum-free culture systems combined with bromodeoxyuridine labelling of proliferating cells and immunochemistry for specific cell types. Once proficiency in olfactory mucosa culture was gained, this model was applied to biopsied olfactory mucosa from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients in order to test the developmental parameters of adhesion, cell proliferation, and cell death in a neural tissue. It was previously shown that olfactory cultures from individuals with schizophrenia had increased cell proliferation and attached less frequently than cultures from healthy controls suggesting disrupted neurogenesis. An aim of this study was to replicate those observations in individuals with schizophrenia and and extend them to individuals with bipolar disorder. After completion of the cell and tissue culture assays, microarray analysis of these cell-based models was used to reveal gene expression differences present between patients and healthy controls. Microarray analysis is a complicated technique and the limited amounts of RNA that can be extracted from a single nasal biopsy further compounds this issue. In order to obtain enough material for microarray hybridization RNA samples underwent antisense amplification. Therefore, with the aim of allowing the candidate to gain proficiency in both these techniques prior to microarray analysis of olfactory biopsies from patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, a pilot microarray study of cultured skin fibroblasts from schizophrenia patients and healthy controls was performed. The present findings show that insulin-like growth factor-I and its receptor were expressed by globose basal cells (the neuronal precursor), by neurons and by olfactory ensheathing cells, the special glia of the olfactory nerve. Insulin-like growth factor-I reduced the numbers of proliferating neuronal precursors, induced their differentiation into neurons, and promoted morphological differentiation of neurons. In contrast, this growth factor was mitogenic for olfactory ensheathing cells. The evidence suggests that insulin-like growth factor-I is an autocrine/paracrine signal that induces neuronal precursors to differentiate into olfactory sensory neurons and induces olfactory ensheathing cells to proliferate and that olfactory mucosa culture is valuable in modelling neurodevelopmental processes. When the olfactory musoca culture model was applied to patients with psychosis, a two-fold increase in proliferation of neural cells was found in schizophrenia compared to controls and bipolars. In bipolar cultures there was a 3-fold increase in cell death compared to controls and schizophrenia. Microarray analysis of cultured skin fibroblasts revealed differential expression of over 1000 genes between patients and controls. Inspection of the significant data showed alterations to gene expression between groups in the cell cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, TCA cycle and oxidative stress pathways. Gene expression in each of these pathways was predominately decreased in schizophrenia. Quantitative PCR analysis of selected differentially expressed genes involved with cell cycle regulation validated the increased expression of vitamin D receptor, and decreased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and DEAD (Asp-GIu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 5 in skin fibroblasts from patients with schizophrenia. Microarray analysis of biopsied olfactory mucosa showed 146 and 139 differentially expressed genes in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder respectively, compared to controls. Consistent with increased mitosis in schizophrenia biopsy cultures three genes that function to positively influence cell cycle had increased expression. In the bipolar disorder group a dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositolsignalling pathway was seen; five genes that either directly function within or interact with this pathway had decreased expression. There is speculation that the therapeutic effect of psychotropic drugs acting upon this pathway in bipolar disorder involves reduction of neuronal cell death. Increased mitosis of neural cells has now been observed in two separate groups of schizophrenic patients indicating a robust finding. The use of fibroblast and olfactory mucosal tissue can be used to study biological and genetic aspects of neurodevelopment in living humans both with and without psychotic disease. Biopsied olfactory mucosa provides benefits over the use of autopsied material for study of psychotic disease because post-mortem duration and agonal factors that lead to tissue, protein and nucleic acid degradation are not an issue. This study provides evidence for a neurodevelopmental aetiology of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder acting at the level of cell cycle control. Subtle changes in the timing of cell cycle regulation could account for the brain pathologies observed in these diseases. Olfactory mucosa culture is a valuable model of neurodevelopmental processes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">adult olfactory epithelium</field><field name="subject">insulan-like growth factor-1</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">neurodevelopment</field><field name="subject">psychotic disease</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051121.133824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consequences of Dispersal, Stream Structure and Earth History on Patterns of Allozyme and Mitochondrial DNA Variation of Three Species of Australian Freshwater Fish</field><field name="creator">McGlashan, Dugald James</field><field name="description">Freshwater systems offer important opportunities to investigate the consequences of intrinsic biological and extrinsic environmental factors on the distribution of genetic variation, and hence population genetic structure. Drainages serve to isolate populations and so preserve historical imprints of population processes. Nevertheless, dispersal between and within drainages is important if the biology of the species confers a good dispersal capability. Knowledge of the population genetic structure or phylogeographic patterns of Australia's freshwater fish fauna is generally depauperate, and the present study aimed to increase this knowledge by investigating patterns of genetic diversity in three Australian species of freshwater fish. I was interested in the relative importance of dispersal capability, the hierarchical nature of stream structure and the consequences of earth history events on patterns of genetic diversity among populations. I examined three species from three families of Australian freshwater fish, Pseudomugil signifer (Pseudomugilidae), Craterocephalus stercusmuscarum (Atherinidae) and Hypseleotris compressa (Gobiidae). These species are abundant, have wide overlapping distributions and qualitatively different dispersal capabilities. I was interested in attempting to unravel how the biological, environmental and historical factors had served to influence the patterns and extent of genetic diversity within each species, thereby inferring some of the important evolutionary processes which have affected Australia's freshwater fauna. I used allozyme and 500-650bp sequences from the ATPase6 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene to quantify the patterns of genetic variation at several hierarchical levels: within populations, among populations within drainages and among drainages. I collected fish at several spatial scales, from species wide to multiple samples within drainages; samples were collected from the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. The species with the highest potential for dispersal, H. compressa, exhibited the lowest levels of genetic differentiation as measured at several allozyme loci (H. compressa: FST=0.014; P. signifer FST=0.58; C. stercusmuscarum FST=0.74). Populations of H. compressa also had low levels of mtDNA differentiation, with many recently derived haplotypes which were widespread along the coast of Queensland. This suggested either considerable gene flow occurs or recent demographic change in the populations sampled. As there was no relationship between geographic distance and genetic differentiation, the populations appeared to be out of genetic drift - gene flow equilibrium, assuming the two-dimensional stepping stone model of gene flow. Estimating contemporary gene flow was thus difficult. It was apparent that there has been a recent population expansion and / or contraction of H. compressa populations. It was concluded that there has been considerably more connectivity among populations of H. compressa in the recent past than either of the other study species.  Populations of P. signifer showed considerable genetic subdivision at different hierarchical levels throughout the sampled range, indicating gene flow was restricted, especially between separate drainages. Two widely divergent regional groups which had high ATPase6 sequence divergence and approximately concordant patterns at allozyme loci were identified. Interestingly, the groups mirrored previous taxonomic designations. There was also significant subdivision among drainages within regional groups. For example, the adjacent Mulgrave-Russell and Johnstone drainages had individuals with haplotypes that were reciprocally monophyletic and had large allozyme frequency differences. This allowed me to examine the patterns of genetic differentiation among populations within drainages of two essentially independent, but geographically close systems. There was as much allozyme differentiation among populations within subcatchments as there was between subcatchments within drainages, and significant isolation by distance among all populations sampled within a drainage. This suggested that the estuarine confluence between subcatchments was not a barrier to P. signifer, but that distance was an important component in the determination of the distribution of genetic diversity within drainages in P. signifer. There were three main areas of investigation for C. stercusmuscarum: comparing upland and lowland streams of the drainages in north Queensland, investigating the consequences of eustasy on coastal margin populations and examining the intriguing distribution of the two putative sub species, C. s. stercusmuscarum and C. s. fulvus in south east Queensland. First, as populations in upland areas of east coast flowing rivers are above large discontinuities in the river profile, their occurrence is presumably the result of gene flow to and / or from lowland areas, or the result of invasions via the diversion of western flowing rivers. Concordant patterns at both genetic markers revealed that the latter possibility was the most likely, with fixed allozyme differences between upland and lowland populations, and large mtDNA sequence divergence. Indeed, it appeared that there may have been two independent invasions into the upland areas of rivers in North Queensland. Second, lowland east coast populations also had large, although not as pronounced, levels of population subdivision. Lack of isolation by distance, but with a concomitant high level of genetic differentiation among many comparisons, was consistent with a scenario of many small, isolated subpopulations over the range. Interestingly, widespread populations in central Queensland coastal populations (drainages which receive the lowest rainfall) were relatively genetically similar. This was consistent with the widest part of the continental shelf which at periods of lower sea level apparently formed a large interconnected drainage, illustrating the effect of eustatic changes on populations inhabiting a continental margin. Third, putative C. s. fulvus in lowland coastal Queensland drainages were genetically more similar to a population of C. s. fulvus collected from a tributary of the Murray-Darling (western flowing) than they were to adjacent putative C. s. stercusmuscarum. This implied that populations in south east Queensland, north to approximately the Burnett River, appeared to be derived from western flowing streams, and not via dispersal from other lowland east coast populations. Determining the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the development of population genetic structure is a difficult task. The present study demonstrated that the species with the highest dispersal potential had the lowest levels of genetic differentiation, waterfalls can limit gene flow, eustasy acts to join and separate populations leading to complex genetic patterns and that drainage rearrangements are important in determining the distribution of genetic diversity of populations now inhabiting isolated drainages. A difficulty with generalising about population genetic structure in obligate freshwater animals is the unique history of not only each drainage, but also the streams within that drainage and the idiosyncratic biological dynamics of the populations inhabiting those drainages.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fish</field><field name="subject">fishes</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">freshwater</field><field name="subject">freshwater fish</field><field name="subject">DNA variation</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">Mitochondrial DNA</field><field name="subject">fish populations -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030226.152217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On being shamed in a nursing culture</field><field name="creator">McIntosh, Wendy H</field><field name="description">This study explored the experience of shame in nursing using an interpretive phenomenological approach as described by van Manen (1997). Shame is a concept that has been extensively theorised within the social sciences as important in the development of individual identity, self esteem and role performance but overlooked in nursing. The purpose of this research was twofold; to gain an understanding of how shame influences and shapes nursing identity and to produce knowledge and stimulate dialogue about what that means for nursing culture. Participants were asked to discuss significant interactions with colleagues. Significantly, all disclosed the experience of shame. Further, four major themes emerged from this study to deepen understanding of what appears to be a cultural experience. The experience of shame involves: self appraisal, professional identity in conflict, the experience of isolation and recrimination. Within each theme a number of sub themes were identified including feeling dumb, being incompetent, withdrawing and going quiet and seeking revenge. The study concluded that in relation to nursing, internalised shame is not readily recognised although negative emotions that are linked to it are clearly felt. When these emotions are left unprocessed or unidentified as shame, then they are likely to have negative consequences. But recognising this hidden shame and bringing it to conscious awareness can express and perhaps relieve shame. Further, shame's adaptive functions, to provide moral direction and teach respect, could be acknowledged or reclaimed. It is argued therefore that acknowledging and discussing shame openly in nursing, such as through future research, scholarships and education, will facilitate consciousness raising and the potential for cultural change.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology of nursing</field><field name="subject">shame in nursing</field><field name="subject">nurse experiences</field><field name="subject">quality of work experience</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060901.153403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Diversity of Macroinvertebrate Grazers in Streams: Relationships With the Productivity and Composition of Benthic Algae</field><field name="creator">McKenny, Claire</field><field name="description">There has been much interest in the last decade concerning the factors that influence diversity, especially how diversity and ecosystem processes may be linked. This study was based in small, cobble streams in South East Queensland. Its aim was to determine how the diversity and composition of consumers (the grazer guild) is influenced by both the production and composition of benthic algae, at different spatial scales. It also aimed to ascertain whether this response differs among grazer sub guilds with different dispersal capabilities. Ten sites in the Upper Brisbane and Mary catchments were sampled. The sites were selected to provide a range of productivity and composition. Grazers from these sites included snails and elmids, and larval mayflies, moths, and caddisflies. Grazer diversity and composition appeared to be structured by catchment scale influences, but environmental variables also affected which animals colonised patches and microhabitats (cobbles) within catchments. Primary productivity and algal composition could not be separated, with highly productive reaches also having a high cover of filamentous algal taxa.  Grazer diversity displayed strongly positive, linear relationships with algal variables at the reach scale. It had a negative relationship with filamentous algae at the cobble scale, and a non-significant hump-shaped relationship with primary productivity. Survey data alone could not separate whether grazers were responding to habitat or food-related drivers, or to variations in productivity. Experimental manipulation of algal variables at the patch scale, using light and nutrients, also could not clearly uncouple the relationship between primary productivity and filamentous algal cover. Once reach scale variation was removed, grazer diversity displayed hump-shaped relationships with algal variables, including algal diversity. Much of this variation was due to patterns in mobile grazers, as sedentary grazers did not respond to algal variation at this scale. The density of the more mobile taxa showed similar patterns to those at the cobble scale (hump-shaped). A second field experiment was carried out in order to further investigate the responses of invertebrates to algal community composition at the cobble scale. Data from all three chapters suggested that as sites shifted to a dominance of filamentous algae, often with an associated increase in GPP, there was also a shift in the grazer community towards more sedentary grazers and away from the more mobile taxa. This also occurred at the cobble scale in the second experiment. The gut analysis and diet studies in the third chapter indicated that while many grazers consumed filamentous algae, it was not assimilated. This suggests that the preferences for sedentary taxa for cobbles and reaches dominated by filamentous algae are likely to be due to some other, possibly habitat-related, factor such as flow or predation refuge. The study provides a rare examination of relationships between primary productivity and consumer diversity in freshwater streams, and finds support for the pattern found in other systems of monotonic relationships of these two variables at large scales and hump-shaped relationships at smaller scales. It emphasises the importance of understanding other, potentially confounding, aspects of communities of producers, and investigates the possible roles of the most important of these (community composition) in structuring consumer communities in the small cobble streams of South-East Queensland.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Macroinvertebrate grazers</field><field name="subject">benthic algae</field><field name="subject">cobble streams (Queensland)</field><field name="subject">stream ecology</field><field name="subject">Upper Brisbane River</field><field name="subject">Mary River</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060308.131239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Canadian and Australian Feature Film Policy in Perspective: A Comparative Study from 1968 to 1998</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Susan M.</field><field name="description">This comparative study is an investigation into the changing concerns of feature film policy in Canada and Australia from 1968 to 1998.

Understanding the natural processes that influence the structure and function of these ecosystems will improve our understanding of how land-use change affects them. Benthic substratum habitat was investigated in a sub-tropical headwater stream by quantifying temporal change to sediment texture of surface sediments (less than 10cm), over four years. Hydrological characteristics were also surveyed in detail, as hydrological regime is a primary determinant of sediment transportation.  Additionally, measures of hydro-geological features - hydraulic conductivity and groundwater depth were made in order to explore features of sediment habitat that extend beyond the sediment-water interface. Whilst the typical discharge pattern was one of intermittent base flows and infrequent, yet extreme flood events associated with monsoonal rain patterns, the study period also encompassed a drought and a one in hundred year flood.  Rainfall and discharge did not necessarily reflect the actual conditions in the stream.  Surface waters were persistent long after discharge ceased.  On several occasions the stream bed was completely dry.  Shallow groundwater was present at variable depths throughout the study period, being absent only at the height of the drought. The sediments were mainly gravels, sand and clay.  Changes in sediment composition were observed for fine particulates (size categories less than 2mm).  The grain size change in the finer sediment fractions was marked over time, although bedload movement was limited to a single high discharge event.  In response to a low discharge regimen (drought), sediments characteristically showed non-normal distributions and were dominated by finer materials.  High-energy discharge regimes (flood) were characterised by coarsening of sands and a diminished clay fraction.  Particulate organic matter from sediments showed trends of build-up and decline with the high and low discharge regimes, respectively. Benthic habitats were described according to prevailing hydro-geological parameters.  Faunas from sediment substratum samples were associated with identified habitat categories.  The fauna reflected the habitat variability in terms of hydrological disturbance of the substratum structure and intermittency of discharge.  An applied multivariate procedure was used to correlate temporally changing environmental parameters and faunal abundance data.  Faunas were correlated with a group of variables dominated by either discharge variables or sediment textural parameters. Sediment characteristics that affect substratum quality and substratum preference at the micro-scale were investigated via hypotheses testing.  A model of carbon loss was used to determine how long particulate organic matter could potentially sustain microbial activity under experimental conditions.  An estimate of up to 200 days was determined from this laboratory experiment.  Secondly, enriched carbon isotopes were used in a field-based experiment to establish a link between sediments and macrofauna.  Enrichment via organic sediments was found for various detritivorous and carnivorous taxa.  In the 'third' experiment, artificial treatments were applied to elucidate substratum preference.  Fauna was offered the choice of variable quantities of clay and/or quality of organic matter.  There were no significant preferences found for the different substratum treatments, although further investigation is needed and a different outcome from this method may be achieved under more benign field conditions than those encountered during this experiment.  Finally, the study was set within a context of the primary features of scale.  Climate and hydrological features, including linkages with the alluvial aquifer and terrestrial ecosystem, and their potential to change within 'ecological time' are perceived as critical to understanding the role of benthic sediment substratum.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intermittent streams</field><field name="subject">sediments</field><field name="subject">hydrology</field><field name="subject">benthic invertebrates</field><field name="subject">sub-tropical</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030725.142256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Solid-Phase Combinatorial Synthesis of 2,6,9- Trisubstituted Purines as Potential Adenosine A3 Receptor Antagonists</field><field name="creator">McKeveney, Declan</field><field name="description">Purines as a class of compounds have been implicated in many biological systems, including as adenosine receptor antagonists. A method of synthesising 2,6,9-trisubstituted purines would be useful to produce small libraries of compounds for probing adenosine receptor selectivity. A library of trisubstituted purines has been achieved using a solid-phase methodology. 	The electronic properties of the substrate were found to result in difficulties with the loading of substrate onto the resin. Theoretical calculations provided the basis for mono-substitution in order to activate the substrate. This modified substrate has loaded onto the resin in reproducible and high yields. Amine and thiol, on-resin, C-2 substitution was shown to proceed at room temperature. This represents significantly milder conditions than are generally seen in the literature. This is due to the activating effect of the carbamate linker chosen on the pyrimidine ring. This also results in a faster reaction rate than is seen in the corresponding solution-phase reaction. This study showed that the electronic profile of the loaded substrate was responsible for the low alkylation on the carbamate nitrogen of loaded dichloro- or C-6 substituted chloropyrimidines. This reaction was modified by activating the pyrimidine ring via C-2 substitution and has been shown to go to completion with three different alkyl groups to give a clean product direct from resin cleavage. On-resin nitro reduction had been planned. The resin bound product would then be carried on to the next step of resin cleavage and cyclisation of the imidazole ring to give the final purine products. On resin reduction could not be achieved, however, cleavage of the compound from the resin and reduction in solution was found to be efficient as the cyclisation reagents could be included in this step without interfering with yield or purity of products and so this represents a clear improvement upon the planned synthesis. Efforts to fully characterise the library brought up issues of purine NMR. Extremely broad signals were observed in the proton spectra of many of the compounds making assignments difficult. Broad 13C NMR signals have also been observed. Restricted rotation about the substituent N-C bond is responsible for these problems. Crystal structure data has confirmed the double bond character of this bond with one of the substituted pyrimidines. High temperature NMR experiments have demonstrated how this can be overcome and the fine structure of the spectra observed. HMBC and COSY correlations have been used alongside the 1H and 13C spectra to allow full characterisation of the compounds wherever possible. Receptor homology models were created and updated for all four adenosine receptor subtypes. Known adenosine agonists and antagonists were created and minimised for use in docking experiments. Receptor docking experimental data is reported. Binding assays are being carried out by a third party and will be submitted for publication at a later date. 	A small library of 2,6,9-trisubstituted purines has been synthesised, exemplifying an efficient and robust method to achieve pure compounds for biological evaluation. A good level of diversity has been achieved at each combinatorial position (two substitutions and an N-alkylation). Final compounds have been isolated in good yields with a high level of purity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Purines</field><field name="subject">adenosine receptor antagonists</field><field name="subject">2</field><field name="subject">6</field><field name="subject">9-trisubstituted purines</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050830.120105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parent Participation, Action Research and Government Through Community: Lessons from a 1990s Queensland Case Study</field><field name="creator">McKibbin, Charmaine Zoe</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the historical relationship between government and self-government, and the contemporary role that Action Research (AR) occupies as a liberal technology of government.  It draws upon the Teaching for Effective Learning in Senior Schooling (TELSS) project as the example. This project, which was based on a 'collaborative' AR methodology, was just one of the many national post-compulsory schooling reform initiatives that emerged during the late 1980s and 1990s. At that time, AR and Participatory Action Research (PAR) were preferred methodologies by education faculty personnel, and some teachers, as practical alternatives to 'positivist' social science approaches. This is still the case, both locally and internationally. The initial focus of the thesis is to trace the role of the school and the family in the government of populations, and show how AR is currently positioned as a mechanism for establishing and installing new forms of self-management within these historical institutional arrangements. This includes enticements and inducements to participate in one's own self-management. The AR perspective seeks to make a practical intervention in the re-organization and management of schools, as well as other workplaces and organizations, as a means to promote and develop ongoing professional learning within these organizations. The thesis highlights some confusing issues surrounding  contemporary attempts by schools to open themselves to the community, however. AR has achieved considerable success to the extent that expert AR consultants have been commonly employed by Education Departments in many countries to foster new ways of attaining educational goals.  Drawing upon other examples, as well as this case study, the contrast between the high expectations of project participants, and their limited outcomes, suggests the need to query AR's representations of participation. This includes some contemporary conceptions of how 'the school community' operates. Is there another way that we can understand this particular territory, and parent involvement in schools more generally, other than in political terms such as the need to 'democratize the community'?  The AR commentary focuses on the 'egalitarian' ideal of emancipation and empowerment via participation. AR's preference for participation through human self-determination over that of statist instrumental rationality is questioned, however, by drawing upon empirical evidence generated by the case study, as well as other theoretically informed material. The thesis moves to an account of the role of different forms of government which enable self-management, particularly the role of the school community within the field of education and its administration.  By situating the TELSS case study and its limits in what Michel Foucault (1991) terms the history of 'governmentality', AR is described as part of government and an aid to social reform programmes. Inside this discussion, some of AR's self promotions and understandings will re re-defined. These include an anti-bureaucratic rhetoric, concerns about hierarchical power relations, and aspirations of self-autonomy, emancipation and social justice.  How is it that educational bureaucracies are so amenable to taking on board goals for educational reform expressed in the form of frequently anti-bureaucratic radical critique? The thesis undertakes the task of investigating this peculiarity, as well as some of the negative outcomes of such liberal governmental undertakings.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">education policy</field><field name="subject">educational reform</field><field name="subject">education and state</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">social justice</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050210.154526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination of Customer Accounting in an Australian Context</field><field name="creator">McManus, Lisa</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on a study that examined customer accounting (CA) in Australian companies. The broad aims of the thesis are to develop an understanding of the organisational role played by CA practice and the role accounting plays in providing information about a firm's customer base. Three empirical phases have been undertaken in the study. The first phase involved exploratory interviews with accountants and marketers from a number of Australian firms. The second phase comprised an in-depth case study that involved the development of a segmental customer profitability analysis in a major Australian telecommunications company. The third empirical phase involved the administration of a survey questionnaire to chief accountants and marketing managers from a number of large Australian companies. A number of significant findings are reported and include: (1) A level of CA practice has been observed that is reasonably in line with what was anticipated based on the minimal previous academic interest in this area. (2) There appears to be a potential for further CA development in Australian companies. (3) The interview findings identified 'short-term tactical decisions' and 'focus attention on maximising customer value' as the two most important organisational roles CA may play. (4) CA systems were found to provide important information for marketing resource allocation decisions, customer retention decisions, customer service management decisions and customer pricing decisions. (5) The main barriers to CA implementation identified during the segmental CPA case study and exploratory interviews concerned information technology and data acquisition problems. This finding was supported by the results of the survey questionnaire phase of the study where in addition to these two barriers, 'other competing organisational priorities' was rated highly as an impediment to CA system development. (6)	Some support was found for the proposed relationships between CA and the contingent factors of company size, customisation, and organisational structure. (7) Limited support was found for the proposed positive association between CA systems and competition intensity and marketing orientation. (8) No support was found for the proposed relationships between perceived environmental uncertainty, organisational strategy, organisational performance and CA systems. (9) Customisation was the only contingent factor found to have a significant impact upon the potential of CA to aid management.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer accounting</field><field name="subject">Australian companies</field><field name="subject">short-term tactical decisions</field><field name="subject">maximising customer value</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070111.145255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Interdependency in the Xinjiang-Central Asian Region</field><field name="creator">McMillan, Ann Mary</field><field name="description">The past decade has seen a transformation in the relationships among states in the Xinjiang-Central Asian region.  The thesis is an analysis of this relationship, a relationship primarily built on economic and strategic interdependency.  Within the thesis, the basis of the relationship is established; the extent of the relationship is ascertained, and the impact of this relationship is evaluated. The thesis differs from previous studies of this area in several ways.  The most significant is that a group of Central Asian states and an autonomous region of China have formed into a unit of economic interdependency, which needs to be assessed as a group rather than as individual entities.  Much of previous and recent scholarship tends to focus on issues within a particular country or part of a country, such as the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China.  However, it is my contention that this is not an adequate representation of what is occurring in the region today.  The focus needs to be widened to take into account the dynamics of this interdependent relationship which consists of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and several of the former Soviet Union states, primarily Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. All of these states with the exception of Uzbekistan are contiguous with Xinjiang.  This relationship of interdependency has reached a level sufficient to influence decisions taken by governments within the region, and a prime factor of this has been the suppression of secessionist movements, principally Uygur separatist movements, among the Uygur diaspora residing in neighbouring states. Another highly relevant issue the thesis evaluates is sources of tension within the Xinjiang-Central Asian region and the impact these tensions have on the interdependency relationship.  An assessment is made as to whether because of this interdependency, the sources of tension may not be adequately addressed by the respective governments to the satisfaction of the general populace.  This is seen as due to the individual governments' hesitation to upset China by addressing such matters as border demarcation and transboundary water diversion between China and neighbouring states.  An outcome of this scenario may be that many of the tensions are left to simmer and therefore bode ill for future stability in the region. Fundamentally, the thesis argues that the matters raised in the previous paragraphs need to be assessed on the basis of an ongoing relationship of interdependency encompassing Xinjiang and several neighbouring Central Asian states.  The overlapping of multiple sources of commonality such as geography, ethnicity, culture, religion, economics and strategic matters, dictates that we should not assess issues on a country-by-country basis.  Rather, it is necessary to consider the region as a whole, taking into account the prevailing conditions emanating from this relationship of economic and strategic interdependency.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Xinjiang-Central Asian region</field><field name="subject">Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region</field><field name="subject">Kazakhstan</field><field name="subject">Kyrgyzstan</field><field name="subject">Tajikistan</field><field name="subject">Uzbekistan</field><field name="subject">economic and strategic interdependence</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061018.133459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and Characterisation of the 5'-Nucleotidase from Escherichia coli</field><field name="creator">McMillen, Lyle</field><field name="description">Escherichia coli 5'-nucleotidase is a periplasmically localised enzyme capable of hydrolysing a broad range of substrates, including all 5'-ribo- and 5'-deoxyribonucleotides, uridine diphosphate sugars, and a number of synthetic substrates such as bis (r-nitrophenyl) phosphate.  The enzyme has been shown to contain at least one zinc ion following purification, and to have two metal binding sites in the catalytic cleft.  5'-Nucleotidase activity is significantly stimulated by the addition of particular divalent metal ions, most notably cobalt which results in a 30-50 fold increase in activity.  Significant sequence homology between the E. coli 5'-nucleotidase and members of the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase family in the catalytic site has lead to 5'-nucleotidase being included in this protein family. This thesis describes the development of a rapid purification methodology for milligram quantities of 5'-nucleotidase, and the investigation of a number of physical and biochemical properties of the enzyme with the aim of comparing these properties to those of certain catalytic site mutants.  The molecular weight of the mature protein was estimated as 58219 daltons, with a specific activity for 5'-AMP, in the presence of 4 mM Co2+ and 13 mM Ca2+ at pH 6.0, of 730 mmol/min/mg.  The presence of up to two zinc ions associated with the purified enzyme was observed using ICP-ES analysis, suggesting both metal ion binding sites are occupied by zinc in vivo, and some degree of displacement of zinc by cobalt could be observed.  Mass spectrometry data, gathered at 60 and 70 mS orifice potential, suggested the presence of a small proportion of material with a mass 118 to 130 daltons greater than the main 5'-nucleotidase mass estimation.  This study suggests that this mass difference, only evident at the lower orificepotential, is due to the presence of two zinc ions closely associated with 5'-nucleotidase. To account for the observed high level of activation of 5'-nucleotidase activity by particular divalent metal ions, this thesis describes a proposed model in which these divalent ions may displace the zinc ion at one of the metal ion binding sites.  This displacement only occurs at one of the two metal ion binding sites, with the other metal binding site retaining the zinc ion already present.  Studies with purified enzyme, each with a single amino acid substitution, lend support to this hypothesis and suggest the identity of the metal ion binding site at which displacement occurs. Seven key catalytic site residues (Asp-41, His-43, Asp-84, His-117, Glu-118, His-217 and His-252) were selected on the basis of sequence conservation within the Ser/Thr protein phosphatases and 5'-nucleotidases.  X-ray crystallographic data published by others during this study implicated five of the selected residues (Asp-41, His-43, Asp-84, His-217 and His-252) directly in metal ion binding, including two residues from each metal ion binding site and one directly involved in both sites (Asp-84).  The remaining two residues (His-117 and Glu-118) are highly conserved but were not thought to play direct roles in metal ion binding.  The seven selected residues were modified by site-directed mutagenesis, and the effect of the amino acid substitutions upon the kinetic properties of 5'-nucleotidase activity was determined.  Residues hypothesised to be involved in metal ion displacement, and subsequent activation of 5'-nucleotidase activity, were identified by reductions in metal ion affinity and increased levels of activation by cobalt compared to the wild type 5'-nucleotidase.  This study suggests that the metal binding site, M2, that includes residues Asp-84, His-217 and His-252, is involved in metal ion displacement, while the other metal binding site, M1, is not.  This, in turn, suggests the metal binding sites are functionally non-equivalent and kinetically distinct.  No residues were identified in this study as playing significant roles in substrate binding, as there was no significant reduction observed in affinity for 5'-AMP observed in any of the catalytic site mutants.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">5'-nucleotidase</field><field name="subject">zinc metalloenzyme</field><field name="subject">phosphoesterase</field><field name="subject">cobalt activation</field><field name="subject">consensus sequence</field><field name="subject">sequence motif</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030226.153545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">John Howard&#146;s Leadership of Australian Foreign Policy 1996 to 2004:  East Timor and the war against Iraq</field><field name="creator">McPhail, Alison May</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a study of John Howard&#146;s leadership of Australian foreign policy from 1996 to 2003.  It documents and examines the way in which John Howard, Australia&#146;s national leader, managed the complex challenges presented by two major events in Australian foreign policy: the East Timor crisis and the war against Iraq. Because it is the national leader who speaks for the nation, the manner in which the Prime Minister articulates and communicates the country&#146;s foreign policy is vitally important, both domestically and internationally. Two theoretical concepts&#151;constant scanning and multidimensional diplomacy&#151;are proposed and developed in this thesis to explore and analyse how national leaders, situated at the nexus of domestic and foreign concerns, manage the distinctive challenges presented to them in this position.  They also assist in understanding and explaining John Howard&#146;s particular approach to these two major foreign policy issues.  This study demonstrates that both constant scanning and multidimensional diplomacy are useful descriptive and normative tools for examining ways in which national leaders communicate and implement their foreign policies in the increasingly interconnected political landscape. By tracing and documenting the trajectory of Howard&#146;s foreign policy, this study finds that his skill and confidence in the area of foreign policy, and his command and control of the foreign policy process, all increased over time.  The evidence also suggests that he developed a greater awareness of the need to employ both constant scanning and multidimensional diplomacy.  However, as this study shows, his absolute commitment to the ANZUS alliance saw him relinquish the responsibility to employ them in the case of Iraq.  This study draws on exisiting knowledge in the areas of leadership, political science and international relations as a basis for testing the proposed concepts of constant scanning and multidimensional diplomacy. It then explores the wider application of these approaches for leaders striving to balance domestic and international concerns and considers their importance for the security and stability of the international system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">John Howard</field><field name="subject">Australian Foreign Policy</field><field name="subject">East Timor</field><field name="subject">Iraq</field><field name="subject">1996 to 2003</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071023.142137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Work Commitment in The Asia Pacific Region: An Insider Study of a Global Hotel Chain</field><field name="creator">McPhail, Ruth Elizabeth</field><field name="description">It is understood that national culture has an impact on organisations but what is not well understood is the extent to which this occurs and how it occurs.  This thesis examines how employees working in a major multinational corporation (MNC) in the Asia Pacific Region (APR) perceive work commitment.  Multinational corporations use ethnocentric and largely American constructs and measures in all areas of staff performance, including work commitment.  This study is situated within the service sector where the work commitment of employees is increasingly posited as an important element of achieving competitive advantage.  This is an applied research study that seeks to both further the understanding of work commitment in a cross-cultural context, namely the collectivist cultures of the APR, and to provide answers to questions that the management of the MNC in question had regarding the applicability of their American-developed measure of work commitment.  The MNC in this study is one of the largest hotel chains in the world, employing 154,000 employees. The methodological approach adopted was a mixed methods sequential exploratory study, with triangulation of data that included: surveys, interviews, focus groups, forced choice questionnaires and expert panels.  The final analysis of data was conducted using the MNC's employee survey (n=19950) of APR countries.  A hallmark of the research is the extensive use of triangulation or multiple methods within a mixed methods approach.  Cross-cultural studies are fraught with methodological problems, and triangulation of data is considered to be essential to overcome a range of problems, associated with the use of traditional survey methods.  This is an insider investigation as the researcher was an employee of the MNC, called Merico for the purposes of this thesis, to maintain the organisation's privacy. The first stage of the study revealed the dimension of collectivism as being of importance to employees in the APR.  The familial-type organisational culture Merico created a degree of isomorphism because it aligned more readily with the collectivist values and orientations of employees.  In the second stage, the research explored work commitment and discovered that in the APR there was a different set of understandings of work commitment compared to the one used currently by Merico.  Through integrating the findings from both stages of the study a new framework of work commitment, called the 'Work and Organisational Kinship' (WOK) framework, was developed.  The WOK was then tested against the American model through using the existing employee survey that Merico conducted in 2000 and a new index of work commitment, called the WOKI was proposed for use by Merico.  The relevance of this study is that it shows that the 'one size fits all' approach to work commitment will no longer provide a sound approach for managing performance within a competitive market place.  The research shows that there are differences between drivers of work commitment and outcomes in the APR compared to those of the US and Australia.  Performance management in Merico is heavily rewarded by work commitment.  To misunderstand work commitment in the context of the APR and to measure it in a culturally insensitive manner, and then apply reward systems accordingly, poses major problems in performance management.  The WOK framework introduces two constructs called 'organisational kinship' and 'service loyalty' that are critical to creating a geocentric approach to work commitment in the APR, and in Merico.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National culture</field><field name="subject">work commitment</field><field name="subject">multinational companies</field><field name="subject">work and organisational kinship framework</field><field name="subject">performance management.</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060220.124315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mothers' Sensitivity to Infants' Communicative Acts</field><field name="creator">Meadows, Denis William</field><field name="description">This series of studies investigated the sensitivity of mothers towards the behaviour of their preverbal infants.  More specifically, the investigation examined the consistency with which mothers identified what they considered to be communicative acts by their infants aged 6, 9, and 12 months, and the contingency and appropriateness of their maternal responses.  The ability of other female adults to identify the same infant acts as communicative as the mothers was also investigated. In Studies one and two, 35 infants and their mothers were videotaped in a laboratory setting.  Three weeks after the videotaping session, the mothers were asked to view a five-minute section and code the stream of infant behaviour into periods when they believed that their infant was engaging in communicative behaviours ('on' events) and periods when they considered that the infants were not ('off' events).  This process was repeated three months after the first coding.  At each coding session the mothers coded the videotape twice.  Each mother's coded records were compared, in pairs, within and across coding sessions and the observed levels of agreement were calculated. A randomization procedure using 1000 iterations of the whole 'on' and 'off' events was used to determine the meaningfulness of the observed level of agreement between pairs of codings by providing distributions of chance levels of agreement with which the observed levels could be compared.  Levels of agreement that exceeded chance values (p equals or is less than .05) were taken as evidence of consistency of maternal response.  Consistency in the identification of communicative acts by other female adults (OAs) was investigated using a sample of 12 of the videotapes.  Each videotape was coded by three separate OAs.  The significance of the observed levels of agreement between the mother's coding and those of the OAs was determined using the randomization procedure.  The results indicated that at each infant age, mothers were able to identify consistently their infant's communicatively salient behaviours, even over inter-coding intervals of three months.  Further, both OAs and mothers identified the same infant behaviours as communicative. The third study investigated the abilities of a different sample of mothers and infants to describe the topography and meaning of their infants' behaviours during the 'on' events.  Mothers' descriptions of their infants' behaviour during the 'on' events were also used to describe changes in the criteria that they used to identify infant behaviours as communicatively salient.  Results indicated that the complexity of the criteria that the mothers used changed across infant age.  First, mothers of younger infants were more likely, than mothers of older infants, to describe a single infant behaviour as being communicatively salient.  The latter were more likely to identify two or three co-occurring infant behaviours as salient.  Second, when more than one infant behaviour was identified in an 'on' event, the mothers of the older infants were more likely than the mothers of younger infants to state that all of the behaviours that they identified were communicatively important. These findings were interpreted to mean that mothers of older infants required more complex constellations of behaviour during the 'on' events in order to identify those behaviours as communicative. Study 4 investigated the contingency and appropriateness of the mothers' responses to the segments of their infants' behaviour that they identified as being communicative.  Across infant age, findings indicated that the mothers' verbal responses to their infants were contingent upon whether they considered that their infants were engaged in communicatively salient behaviours.  During periods of infant behaviour that the mothers identified as being communicative, mothers talked significantly more to their infants than they did when their infant's behaviour was considered to be non-communicative. Further, mothers' verbal responses were interpreted as being appropriate in two ways.  First, during the 'on' events, changes occurred over infant age in the balance between the use of utterances designed to attract and maintain the attention of the infant (Attentional Directives) and those designed to provide comment on infant behaviour (Feedback).  This shift is in keeping with widely reported changes in infant behaviour as children grow older (i.e., older infants' play a greater role in initiating and maintaining episodes of interaction).  Second, during periods when the mothers considered that their infants were not communicating ('off' events) they rarely used 'Feedback' verbal responses.  During 'off' events, mothers maintained high levels of 'Attentional Directive' talk, irrespective of infant age. Taken collectively, these studies provide evidence that supports the view that mothers are sensitive to what they consider to be communicative behaviours by their infants in terms  of the consistency, contingency and appropriateness of their behaviour. The unique features of this investigation, the generality of the findings and the implications for future research are discussed in the final chapter.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infant</field><field name="subject">infants</field><field name="subject">mother</field><field name="subject">mothers</field><field name="subject">maternal</field><field name="subject">mothering</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030226.164131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trophic Ecology and Energy Sources for Fish on the Floodplain of a Regulated Dryland River: Macintyre River, Australia</field><field name="creator">Medeiros, Elvio S. F</field><field name="description">Drylands occupy about one-third of the world's land surface area and rivers in these regions have less predictable flow regimes than those in humid tropical and temperate regions. Australia's dryland river-floodplain systems cycle through recurrent periods of floods and droughts, oflen resulting in extreme hydrological variability. As a result, these systems have been described as having a 'boom and boost' ecology with periods of high productivity associated with flooding. Not surprisingly, flow and its variability have been recognised as major driving forces in the ecological functioning of Australian rivers and responses to flow variability from fish and aquatic invertebrates have been reasonably well described. Furthermore, the reduced amount of water reaching floodplain waterbodies due to river regulation has been held responsible for successional changes in aquatic biota and, consequently, the resources available for both fish and invertebrates. However, information regarding the impacts of water resource development has generally focused on within-channel processes of Australian rivers, not on floodplains, which are arguably more affected by water development. The following dissertation is concerned with how different types of natural and modified floodplain lagoons are able to trophically support their fish communities in the floodplain of the Macintyre River, Border Rivers catchment (QLD/NSW), a regulated dryland river. This study focuses on the influence of flooding and the implications of an extended dry period, and different levels of flow regulation, on the feeding ecology of selected fish species (Ambassis agassizil, Lelopotherapon unicolor and Nematalosa erebi) between 2001 and 2003. Food resources consumed by fish are hypothesised to vary in response to flooding, when inundation of isolated lagoons and vast floodplain areas can result in a burst of primary and secondary productivity. Given the permanently elevated water levels of some regulated floodplain lagoons, fish diets are hypothesised to be less variable in these floodplain habitats in comparison to diets of fish from floodplain lagoons with natural flow and water regime. Feeding ecology is examined firstly, in terms of diet composition of selected fish species, using stomach content analysis, and secondly, in relation to possible energy sources sustaining fish (using stable isotope analysis) in selected floodplain lagoons and a site in the main channel of the Macintyre River. The information produced should allow managers to take variations in food resources, food web structure and dietary ecology into account in management regimes for refugia and dryland systems in general. Factors such as diel and ontogenetic variations in dietary composition and food intake by fish are shown to considerably affect ovemll dietary patterns of each study species. Therefore, it is important to understand the contributions of such factors to the variability of fish dietary patterns before performing studies on resource use by fish in floodplain habitats of the Macintyre River. Major food categories consumed by the study species were zooplankton, aquatic invertebrates and detrital material. Zooplankton was of particular importance as this food item was ingested by all three study species at some stage of their life history. Spatial and temporal variation in diet composition of the study species was mostly associated with changes in prey items available across floodplain habitats and between seasons (summer/winter). The low magnitude of flooding events during the study period is arguably the most likely factor influencing the lack of patterns of variation in fish diets in floodplain habitats subject to flooding, whereas in non-flooded lagoons the observed dietary variation was a consequence of successional changes in composition of the aquatic fauna as the dry season progressed. Water regime had an important effect on differences in fish diet composition across lagoons, but further evaluation of the influence of flooding is needed due to overall lack of major flooding events during the study period. Autochthonous resources, namely plankton, were the basis of the food web and phytoplankton in the seston is the most likely ultimate energy source for fish consumers, via planktonic suspension feeders (zooplankton). Nevertheless, organic mailer could not be disregarded as an important energy source for invertebrates and higher consumers. In general, the present study does not provide support for the major models predicting the ftinctioning of large rivers, such as the River Continuum Concept and Flood Pulse Concept, which argue that allochthonous organic matter either from upstream or from the floodplain are the most important sources of carbon supporting higher consumers. In contrast, the Riverine Productivity Model would be more appropriate to describe the food web and energy sources for consumers in the Macintyre River floodplain as this model suggests that local productivity, based on autochthonous phytoplankton and organic matter, ftiels food webs in large rivers. The results of this study suggest that factors known to affect phytoplankton production in floodplain lagoons (e.g. flow regulation, turbidity and nutrient/herbicide inputs) must be seriously considered in current landscape and water management practices.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trophic ecology</field><field name="subject">floodplain ecology</field><field name="subject">Macintyre River</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">dryland river</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051115.174552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Audio Source Separation Using Perceptual Principles for Content-Based Coding and Information Management</field><field name="creator">Melih, Kathy</field><field name="description">The information age has brought with it a dual problem. In the first place, the ready access to mechanisms to capture and store vast amounts of data in all forms (text, audio, image and video), has resulted in a continued demand for ever more efficient means to store and transmit this data. In the second, the rapidly increasing store demands effective means to structure and access the data in an efficient and meaningful manner. In terms of audio data, the first challenge has traditionally been the realm of audio compression research that has focused on statistical, unstructured audio representations that obfuscate the inherent structure and semantic content of the underlying data. This has only served to further complicate the resolution of the second challenge resulting in access mechanisms that are either impractical to implement, too inflexible for general application or too low level for the average user. Thus, an artificial dichotomy has been created from what is in essence a dual problem. The founding motivation of this thesis is that, although the hypermedia model has been identified as the ideal, cognitively justified method for organising data, existing audio data representations and coding models provide little, if any, support for, or resemblance to, this model. It is the contention of the author that any successful attempt to create hyperaudio must resolve this schism, addressing both storage and information management issues simultaneously. In order to achieve this aim, an audio representation must be designed that provides compact data storage while, at the same time, revealing the inherent structure of the underlying data. Thus it is the aim of this thesis to present a representation designed with these factors in mind. Perhaps the most difficult hurdle in the way of achieving the aims of content-based audio coding and information management is that of auditory source separation. The MPEG committee has noted this requirement during the development of its MPEG-7 standard, however, the mechanics of "how" to achieve auditory source separation were left as an open research question. This same committee proposed that MPEG-7 would "support descriptors that can act as handles referring directly to the data, to allow manipulation of the multimedia material." While meta-data tags are a part solution to this problem, these cannot allow manipulation of audio material down to the level of individual sources when several simultaneous sources exist in a recording. In order to achieve this aim, the data themselves must be encoded in such a manner that allows these descriptors to be formed. Thus, content-based coding is obviously required. In the case of audio, this is impossible to achieve without effecting auditory source separation. Auditory source separation is the concern of computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). However, the findings of CASA research have traditionally been restricted to a limited domain. To date, the only real application of CASA research to what could loosely be classified as information management has been in the area of signal enhancement for automatic speech recognition systems. In these systems, a CASA front end serves as a means of separating the target speech from the background "noise". As such, the design of a CASA-based approach, as presented in this thesis, to one of the most significant challenges facing audio information management research represents a significant contribution to the field of information management. Thus, this thesis unifies research from three distinct fields in an attempt to resolve some specific and general challenges faced by all three. It describes an audio representation that is based on a sinusoidal model from which low-level auditory primitive elements are extracted. The use of a sinusoidal representation is somewhat contentious with the modern trend in CASA research tending toward more complex approaches in order to resolve issues relating to co-incident partials. However, the choice of a sinusoidal representation has been validated by the demonstration of a method to resolve many of these issues. The majority of the thesis contributes several algorithms to organise the low-level primitives into low-level auditory objects that may form the basis of nodes or link anchor points in a hyperaudio structure. Finally, preliminary investigations in the representation&#146;s suitability for coding and information management tasks are outlined as directions for future research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">auditory source separation</field><field name="subject">computational auditory scene analysis</field><field name="subject">CASA</field><field name="subject">audio data</field><field name="subject">sound data</field><field name="subject">information management</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050114.081327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tissue Specific Gene Expression Patterning and Carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">Mellick, Albert S., Jr.</field><field name="description">Despite significant advances in diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Australian women. Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in both males and females; after prostate and breast cancer, respectively, and excluding non-melanocytic skin cancer. Both breast cancer and colorectal cancer follow a common progressive course of illness; presenting (at least initially) with benign symptoms that can be treated by ablation (or removal) of the affected area. Cancer progression is associated with breakdown of tissue barriers (such as basement membranes), leading to the spread of cancer cells (via the vasculature or lymphatic system), and the establishment of secondary metastatic disease at green-field sites. Secondary tumours presenting in the lungs, ovaries, liver, bone, or brain are associated with chronic-debilitating symptoms that are difficult to treat, and will result in death. In the case of breast and colon cancer, effective early therapeutic intervention does have a significant impact upon patient survival. Tumour progression in breast and colon carcinomas is characterised by invasion of the surrounding stroma, and the acquisition of stromal characteristics, by previously epithelial cells. This progression is associated with the expression of extracellular proteases (ECPs) and increased motility. The process of mesenchymal transformation that tumour cells undergo is also referred to as the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In general terms the aim of the study, presented in this thesis, was to investigate gene expression in cancer biology; and to characterise changes in breast cancer and colon cancer, with a focus on those genes, and gene products that may play a role in metastasis, including a family of ECPs, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In our laboratory, we have applied methods in microdissection, differential display polymerase chain reaction amplification (DD-PCR), and array hybridisation analysis to identify gene expression patterns in late stage archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast tumour biopsies that may be indicative of the EMT; or the response to the surrounding stroma/interstitium to the presence of the tumour.' The quality of nucleic acid obtainable from FFPE material presents a considerable challenge for gene expression studies. In order to identify tissue specific gene expression patterns, DD-PCR products, amplified from message obtained following segregation of tumour tissue from surrounding stroma, was hybridised to arrayed cDNA libraries created from stromal tumours, or sarcomas. In this way, 21 known genes, or expressed sequence tags (ESTs), were identified. These included the cytoskeletal element and EMT marker, vimentin, the mammary developmental factor and, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, and the cargo selection protein (TIP47). Seventeen genes showed differential expression in either the tumour, or stromal fractions. When applied to transformed breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-435 &amp; T47D) DD-array analysis revealed a further 17 genes that were differentially regulated in invasive cells, compared with those displaying a less invasive phenotype. Six of the ESTs identified by DD-PCR array analysis, had no known (or predicted) function. For example, bcaf-2 was identified as the 3'-end of a putative open reading frame (ORF) localised to chromosome 6, while bcaf-10 showed homology with a known ORF. In order to analyse the expression of these bcafs further, a stromal cell culture model, representative of the original osteosarcoma cDNA libraries from which they were obtained, was used. In this model, CD14' (or adherent) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), can be allowed to differentiate into macrophage-like (ML) cells; while cells treated with M-CSF, and the receptor activator of NF-KB ligand (RANKL) will differentiate into multinucleate osteoclast-like (OCL) multinucleate giant cells. Uniquely, the stromal EST, bcaf-2 was expressed only by RANKL-treated (or OCL) cells. bcaf-2 and other ESTs, identified by DD-PCR analysis (and recently published) are the subject of on going research in our laboratory. The role of RANKL in mammary gland development and bone metastasis suggested that the identification of a RANKL-regulated stromal factor in breast tissue (bcaf-2) was not an artefact. RANKL is a membrane-bound, member of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a cytokine super family. In order to test the hypothesis that RANKL might act as an inflammatory cytokine to regulate clinically significant stromal gene expression in the breast, we employed quantitative real time PCR analysis to examine the relative levels of selected members of a group of metal dependent ECPs, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). RNA was extracted from ML cells and OCL cells, as well as RANK positive breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MDA-MB-435 &amp; MCF-7). When the relative levels of protease mRNA were compared we demonstrated a significant (&gt;20- fold) specific increase in collagenase (collagenase 2lMMP-8 and collagenase 3lMMP-13), and the tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-2 expression in M-CSF and RANKL treated PBMCs cells. When the assay was applied to RANKL treated breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D &amp; MDAMB- 231), minor (40-fold) but potentially significant alterations in stromal protease gene expression were observed. The changes observed did not however, support the hypothesis that RANKL might act as an inflammatory cytokine to induce significant alterations in ECP expression in breast cancer cells. To investigate the role of RANKL as a driver of EMT in aberrant breast epithelium, total message (mRNNcDNA) from T47D, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells, and message from the same cell lines treated with RANKL were compared by comparative fluorescent cDNA microarray analysis. Of the 1,700 targets available on the arrays, this study identified 160 that were differentially expressed in RANKL treated cells. The results suggest that RANKL may promote rather than suppress a mammary epithelial phenotype in breast cancer. In fact a putative mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) was observed following microscopic analysis, and this finding is the subject of on going research in our laboratory. Sporadic structural alterations in certain mitogenic factors represent important early events in cancer progression, while inherited mutations govern familial susceptibility to disease. In colon cancer, a close link exists between Winglessllnt (WNT) signalling, disease pathology, and the expression of MMPs. To examine the relationship between protease expression and structural genetic alterations in this EMT-linked signalling pathway, and others, we applied combined QPCR analysis of MMP expression and PCR-Single Strand Conformation Analysis (SSCA) to 26 colonic tumours, and patient-matched normal colonic mucosa. In this study, significant correlations between the expression of ECPs, and a key mediator of WNT signalling (p-catenin) were identified. While tumours possessing specific functional mutations in K-Ras, were found to group with phenotypic clustering based on protease gene expression. This result may be due to an interruption of normal interactions between RasIRaf signalling and transforming growth factor (TGF) P signalling, via Sma- and Mad- related protein (SMAD) signalling. These results demonstrate that the already identified link between mutations in kinase signalling, and aspects of gross colon tumour morphology (such as dysplasia) may be due to aberrant MMP expression patterning. The final aim of this research was to utilise methods developed in microdissection and specific Q-PCR analysis, to identify whether tumour-stroma differences in MMP gene expression might be used as markers of disease pathology. Total RNA from tumour, and biopsy-matched adjacent stromal tissue were segregated from 35 FFPE archival breast tumour biopsies. Comparison with stroma identified specific associations between TIMP-2 expression in the stroma and lymph node involvement, as well as stromelysin-3 (MMP-I I ) and TIMP-I expression and calcification of the tumour. Furthermore, a significant correlation was identified in the pattern of gelatinase (gelatinase AIMMP-2 &amp; gelatinaseB1MMP-9) expression; while no significant correlation was identified in tumour-stroma MMP gene expression differences, and tumour grade, or hormone receptor status. These results suggest that coordinated changes within the tumour, and proximal stromal tissues (rather than tissue specific changes per se), regulate pathologically significant changes in breast carcinogenesis. In conclusion, this thesis describes the use of novel techniques in specific and global gene expression analysis that permitted examination of stromal gene expression changes in epithelial tumour progression. Microdissection facilitated localisation of expression to particular tissues, while cell culture models provided material with which to optimise and demonstrate the efficacy of techniques used (where tumour material itself was not abundant). Furthermore, we have identified significant and specific correlations between general stromal protease gene expression changes, a putative mammary epithelial differentiation factor (RANKL), alterations in growth factor signalling, and epithelial tumour pathology in the breast and colon. The combination of techniques developed in this study may assist in improvement of categorisation of tumours in clinical pathology. Specifically, the development of novel grading systems that link underlying molecular genetic changes with changes in tumour pathology. These processes may assist to improve diagnosis and provide more effective patient/tumour-specific drug therapies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gene expression analysis</field><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">breast cancer</field><field name="subject">colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">carcinogenesis</field><field name="subject">RANKL</field><field name="subject">microdissection</field><field name="subject">differential display polymerase chain reaction amplification</field><field name="subject">array hybridisation analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041102.114313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stable Isotope Tests of the Trophic Role of Estuarine Habitats for Fish</field><field name="creator">Melville, Andrew J</field><field name="description">The role of autotrophic production in different coastal habitats in the production of fish in estuaries is an important consideration in coastal management and conservation.  In the estuarine waters of the Australian east coast, many economically important fish species occur over mudflats lacking conspicuous vegetation.  I used stable isotope analysis to examine where such fish ultimately derived their nutrition, in the subtropical waters of southern Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. I first tested traditional processing methodologies of autotroph samples, in this case of mangrove leaves, and examined variability in mangrove isotope values at different spatial scales.  Mangrove leaves processed using time-consuming grinding showed no significant difference in isotope values than coarsely broken leaf fragments.  Isotope values of green leaves were not meaningfully different from yellow or brown leaves that would normally be the leaves that actually dropped on to the sediment.  Future analyses therefore can use green leaves, since they are more abundant and therefore more easily collected, and can simply be processed as whole leaf fragments rather than being ground to a powder.  Carbon and nitrogen isotope values varied at several spatial scales.  The proportion of variability partitioned at different scales varied depending on the species of mangrove and element (C or N) analysed.  To properly represent a geographic area, isotope analysis should be done on leaves collected at different locations and, especially, from different trees within locations. The autotrophic source(s) supporting food webs leading to fish production on mudflats might be either in situ microphytobenthos or material transported from adjacent habitats dominated by macrophytes.  I tested the importance of these sources by measuring ?13C values of 22 fish species and six autotroph taxa (microphytobenthos on mudflats, and seagrass, seagrass epiphytic algae, mangroves, saltmarsh succulents and saltmarsh grass in adjacent habitats) in Moreton Bay.  I calculated the distribution of feasible contributions of each autotroph to fishes.  All fish ?13C values lay in the enriched half of the range for autotrophs.  For over 90% of fishes, the top three contributing autotrophs were seagrass, epiphytes and saltmarsh grass, with median estimates of approximately 60-90% from these sources combined.  Seagrass was typically ranked as the main contributor based on medians, while epiphytic algae stood out based on 75th percentile contributions.  The other three sources, including MPB, were ranked in the top three contributors for only a single fish.  Organic matter from seagrass meadows is clearly important at the base of food webs for fish on adjacent unvegetated mudflats, either through outwelling of particular organic matter or via a series of predator-prey interactions (trophic relay).  Modelling results indicate that saltmarsh grass (Sporobolus) also had high contributions for many fish species, but this is probably a spurious result, reflecting the similarity in isotope values of this autotroph to seagrass.  Carbon from adjacent habitats and not in situ microphytobenthos dominates the nutrition for this suite of 22 fishes caught over mudflats. The ultimate autotrophic sources supporting production of three commercially important fish species from Moreton Bay were re-examined by further analysing carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data.  Mean isotope values over the whole estuary for fish and autotroph sources were again modelled to indicate feasible combinations of sources.  Variability in isotope values among nine locations (separated by 3-10 km) was then used as a further test of the likelihood that sources were involved in fish nutrition.  A positive spatial correlation between isotope values of a fish species and an autotroph indicates a substantial contribution from the autotroph.  Spatial correlations were tested with a newly developed randomisation procedure using differences between fish and autotroph values at each location, based on carbon and nitrogen isotopes combined in two-dimensional space.  Both whole estuary modelling and spatial analysis showed that seagrass, epiphytic algae and particulate organic matter in the water column, potentially including phytoplankton, are likely contributors to bream (Acanthopagrus australis) nutrition.  However, spatial analysis also showed that mangroves were involved (up to 33% contribution), despite a very low contribution based on whole estuary modelling.  Spatial analysis for sand whiting (Sillago ciliata) demonstrated the importance of two sources, mangroves and microalgae on the mudflats, considered unimportant based on whole estuary modelling.  No spatial correlations were found between winter whiting (Sillago maculata) and autotrophs, either because fish moved among locations or relied on different autotrophs at different locations.  Spatial correlations between consumer and source isotope values provide a useful analytical tool for identifying the role of autotrophs in foodwebs, and were used here to demonstrate that organic matter from adjacent habitats, and in some cases also in situ production of microalgae, were important to fish over mudflats. Whilst recognising that production from several habitats is implicated in the nutrition of fishes over mudflats in Moreton Bay, clearly the major source is from seagrass meadows.  Organic matter deriving from seagrass itself and/or algae epiphytic on seagrass is the most important source at the base of fisheries food webs in Moreton Bay.  The importance of seagrass and its epiphytic algae to production of fisheries species in Moreton Bay reinforces the need to conserve and protect seagrass meadows from adverse anthropogenic influences.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autotrophic production</field><field name="subject">fish production</field><field name="subject">estuarine habitats</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060824.144508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artist-in-Residence: A Catalyst to Deeper Learning in Middle Phase Schooling</field><field name="creator">Menzies, Victoria Jane</field><field name="description">The study sought to investigate the nature of learning that occurs in two different approaches (integrated and non-integrated) to an artist-in-residency program. The program was conducted in middle phase schooling, and adopted the principles of authentic learning. Two year five classes and their teachers participated in the study. The residency provided learning experiences that connected to the curriculum unit theme for one year five class (integrated), but not for the other year five class (non-integrated). These experiences were designed to relate to the learner's lived experiences and promote higher-order thinking processes. The study sought to explore the potential for visual arts residencies to foster more 'authentic' modes of learning. The study examined children's ability to transfer knowledge, gained through the visual and verbal analysis of images, by manipulating and integrating diverse information and ideas. Grounded Theory was deemed to be an appropriate research methodology for this study as it involves gathering data in field settings and applying inductive methods to analyze this data. Diverse data collection strategies were implemented including: teacher stories, interviews, student reflection, researcher observations and student artworks. LeximancerTM software was selected as an instrument for analyzing data. This software was considered appropriate as it fosters a descriptive and interpretive approach to analysis. The findings of the study indicated that children who participated in the integrated artist-in-school's curriculum program demonstrated more evidence of higher-order thinking processes than children who participated in the non-integrated program. The participants undertaking the integrated approach were able to establish relatively complex relationships between the central residency concepts, demonstrating an ability to use visual and verbal codes of communication to articulate their ideas, knowledge and experiences. A further important finding identified positive student behavioural outcomes, where the integrated residency approach appeared to connect group members as small supportive learning communities. The study also identified a transition in the teacher's perspectives on teaching and learning after participating in the integrated approach. This research project has significance both nationally and internationally by investigating current practices in artist-in-schools programs that both enhance and hinder educational outcomes. The study has significance to the broader educational community in terms of its focus on the role of visual arts specialist adjuncts in maximising learning outcomes. The findings of this study could provide insight into the interrelationship between visual arts and other curriculum areas to heighten student learning outcomes. The findings of the study illustrate how particular approaches to visual art in education can enhance children's learning and development. These insights can assist artists undertaking residencies in schools, and the teachers involved, to provide richer learning experiences. The findings provide ifirther evidence to support an approach that involves close collaboration between resident artists and educators. It is recommended that the residency learning experiences are connected to the children's lived experiences and that there is social support from teachers, parents and peers. It is also argued that for a residency to be considered 'authentic', the approach requires a number of essential and valuable attributes. These essential and valuable attributes have two tiers of application which coalesce to contribute to the efficacy of a school art residency.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrated learning</field><field name="subject">non-integrated learning</field><field name="subject">artist-in-residence</field><field name="subject">primary school learning</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051130.101749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education and its Critics: Principles and Programmes in Australian Education Policy</field><field name="creator">Meredyth, Denise Lee</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the relationship between the education system and its critics - with the terms in which programmes of educational reform are viewed by critical intellectuals, and with the claims and limitations of a particular mode of 'principled' critique. It explores this concern in relation to a number of recent developments in Australian education policy, describing the debates that they have engendered and identifying the political ambiguities that attend them. Three case studies are developed. The first is drawn from reactions to the recent bureaucratic reorganisation of higher education, especially those responses concentrated on the defence of the humanities. The second concerns developments in post-compulsory education, especially the construction of the new national credentialling system based on the assessment of 'Key Competencies'. The third addresses the endemic problem of educational assessment and equity. While each of these case studies is discussed in its own right, the three areas of discussion supplement one another within an overall argument concerning the relationship between the education system and a particular mode of 'principledt critique. In exploring this relationship, the thesis puts the case that we require a more historically-informed understanding of current problems in Australian education and a more pragmatic appreciation of the achievements of the existing education system. The issues raised are timely ones. Matters of educational policy have become particularly pressing over the past decade, as Australian education has undergone significant changes. In recent years, we have seen the effects of the drive towards a national education system, of the reorganisation of higher education, of the development of schemes for national credentialling and of the reconstruction of links between schooling, training and industry. These reforms have been driven by some pressing imperatives: to produce a trained and flexible workforce; to monitor levels of literacy and numeracy at a national level; and to satisfy the 'unmet demand' for increased educational places, while managing a limited educational budget.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian education policy</field><field name="subject">key competencies</field><field name="subject">vocational training</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050901.095322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing Revolution: The British Radical Literary Tradition as the Seminal Force in the Development of Adult Education, its Australian Context, and the Life and Work of Eric Lambert</field><field name="creator">Merlyn, Teri</field><field name="description">This thesis tells the story of an historical tradition of radical literacy and literature that is defined as the British radical literary tradition. It takes the meaning of literature at its broadest understanding and identifies the literary and educational relations of what E.P. Thompson terms 'the making of the English working class' through its struggle for literacy and freedom. The study traces the developing dialectic of literary radicalism and the emergent hegemony of capitalism through the dissemination of radical ideas in literature and a groundswell of public literacy. The proposed radical tradition is defined by the oppositional stance of its participants, from the radical intellectual's critical texts to the striving for literacy and access to literature by working class people. This oppositional discourse emerged in the fourteenth century concomitant with nascent capitalism and has its literary origins in utopian vision. This nascent utopian imagination conceived a democratic socialism that underpinned the character of much of the following oppositional discourse. The thesis establishes the nexus of the oppositional discourse as a radical literary tradition and the earliest instances of adult education in autodidacticism and informal adult education. The ascent of middle class power through the industrial revolution is shadowed by the corresponding descent of the working class into poverty. Concomitant with this social polarisation is the phenomena of working class literary agency as the means to political and economic agency. While Protestant dissenting groups such as the Diggers and Levellers were revolutionary activists, it was Methodism that formed a bulwark against revolution. Yet it was their emphasis on self-improvement that contributed to an increasingly literate populace. Radical texts produced and disseminated by individuals and organisations and read by autodidactics and informal reading groups are seminal in the formation of a working class identity. Spearheaded by the Chartist movement, education became a central ethic of working class politics and the civil struggle for economic and political justice throughout the nineteenth and well into the twentieth centuries. The avant garde movements of the early twentieth century are analysed as a strand of this tradition. The narrative of the thesis then moves to the penal colony of Australia and explores the radical literary tradition's development there. Early colonial culture is seen as having a strong impetus towards a developing a native literary expression of the new land. Where conservative colonial literature struggled to differentiate itself from formal British literary models, the radical heritage and its utopian vision of a working man's paradise gave definitive expression to the Australian experience. This expression was strongly influenced by Chartist ideals. The British radical literary tradition is thus seen to have had a dominant influence in the development of a native radical literary tradition that strove to identify the national character. Socialist thought developed in Australia in concert with that in the parent culture, and anarchist and libertarian trends found a ready home amongst independent minded colonials. Yet, in preventing the formation of a native aristocracy the small radical population made a compromise with liberalism that saw a decidedly conservative streak develop in the early labour movement. There were little in the way of sophisticated radical literary offerings at first, but from the mid-nineteenth century a vanguard of radicals produced a thriving native press and other fugitive text forms. At the turn of the century the native radical literary tradition was vibrantly diverse, with a definitive style that claimed literary ownership of the Australian character. However, exhausted by the battles over WWI conscription and isolated by censorship, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was able to subsume the vanguard position from the socialists. The Party laid claim to the Australian radical literary tradition, at once both strengthening it with the discipline of a Marxist ideology and diminishing its independence and diversity. Party literary theory centred upon the issue of class, developing a doctrine of socialist realism that communist writers were expected to practice. How well a writer adhered to socialist realist principles became a measure of their class position and loyalty. Drawing more from primary sources, the thesis develops an analysis of the intellectual development of the Australian post-WWII writer Eric Lambert through his experience of class instability during Depression and war. The study examines Lambert's decision to join the Party and his literary response to his experiences of war, the Party, the turmoil of 1956 and life after the Party. Lambert's body of work is then analysed as the unintentional memoir of a writer working as an adult educator in the radical literary tradition. Lambert's struggles, for artistic independence within the narrow precepts of Party dogma and with class tensions, were common amongst intellectuals committed to the communist cause. Like many of his peers, Lambert resigned from the Party at the end of 1956 and suffered a period of ideological vacuum. However, he continued to write as a Marxian educator, seeking to reveal that which makes us human in the humanity of ordinary people. It is concluded that, while the Party did much to foster disciplined cohesion, the mutual distrust it generated amongst its intellectuals suppressed the independent thought that had kept the radical literary tradition alive. Although the Party developed an ideological strength within the radical literary tradition, its dominance over thirty years and subsequent fall from grace acted to fragment and discredit that centuries-old tradition which it subsumed. An argument is made for a reinvestment of the centrality of the radical literary tradition in the education of adults for the maintenance of social justice and the democratic project.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">British literature</field><field name="subject">radical</field><field name="subject">radicals</field><field name="subject">radicalism</field><field name="subject">intellectuals</field><field name="subject">intellectualism</field><field name="subject">working class</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">socialism</field><field name="subject">capitalism</field><field name="subject">Protestantism</field><field name="subject">Methodism</field><field name="subject">Chartism</field><field name="subject">Chartist</field><field name="subject">England</field><field name="subject">Great Britain</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Eric Lambert</field><field name="subject">socialist realism</field><field name="subject">Marxist</field><field name="subject">Marxism</field><field name="subject">communist</field><field name="subject">communism</field><field name="subject">Left</field><field name="subject">left-wing</field><field name="subject">intellectuals</field><field name="subject">adult education</field><field name="subject">adult literacy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040616.131738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic and Labour Productivity Growth: A Regional Analysis of the States of Australia and the USA</field><field name="creator">Meyer-Boehm, Gudrun</field><field name="description">One of the main underlying sources of economic growth is productivity. An economy can grow by either accumulation of its inputs, namely labour and capital, or improvements in productivity. The latter implies that more can be produced with the same amount of inputs, generating a greater amount of income that can be distributed among the economy's population. With rising per capita incomes, an economy can provide higher living standards and well-being.  This thesis analyses variations in economic and productivity trends among the states of Australia and the USA. It investigates whether disparities in GSP per capita, labour and multifactor productivity among the states have declined (converged) or widened (diverged), during this period.  The analysis is undertaken at a national level as well as for specific industries to identify the sectoral sources of the various trends. Further, in an interstate analysis the performance of individual states is examined to identify those that may have had a major role in accounting for the observed trends. The analysis employs both cross - section and time - series techniques.  Contrary to earlier studies, this thesis finds that lately the interstate dispersion of per capita incomes and productivity has stopped decreasing. In Australia, once the Mining sector (which is a special case) is excluded from the analysis, the levels of GSP per capita and labour productivity in the various states are found to have neither converged nor diverged.  Convergence trends among the US states observed prior to the 1990s have not only slowed down but even reversed into divergence. Divergence in labour productivity started during the 1980s in the service industries and was followed by the Manufacturing sector (and here in particular by the Electronic and Electrical Equipment industry) during the 1990s. There appears to be a belt of states in the West (and a few states in the North-East) which started off relatively poorly but managed to catch-up with the richer states due to an above average growth performance in labour productivity and multi factor productivity. Some of these states did not only manage to catch-up with richer ones but continued to surge ahead, causing the observed increase in the interstate dispersion in recent years.  Policy makers, especially those in the states that are falling behind need to develop policies that will lead to an increase in the rate of productivity growth. In order to achieve this they must foster industries, which are conducive to higher growth rates and adopt policies that would increase the productivity of the labour force. These policies will need to create an environment in which productivity enhancing innovation can be sustained.

The problem is addressed firstly, by examining the nature of problems, including design problems. It is argued that design problems are complex and ill-defined and can be distinguished from non-design problems. Secondly, design expertise is examined. It was found that design experts have a large store of design knowledge in a form that is readily accessible, and engage in extensive problem-finding prior to generating design solutions. Thirdly, the role of visual mental images as a component of design problem-solving and design expertise is examined. It is argued that visual mental images are important features of both design expertise and the transition from novice to expert. A number of case studies are designed and conducted. The findings of these studies are interpreted as supporting the theoretical ideas developed in the thesis. The introduction of design-based technology programs into Australian high schools has created the need for teachers to be able to assist students to generate creative solutions to design problems. Currently, technology teachers are experiencing difficulty in helping students to generate creative solutions to design problems. Hence a better understanding of design process may help to shape teaching and learning in design-based subjects. Furthermore, many complex everyday problems share similar properties with design problems. The research may therefore contribute to the understanding of the way people solve problems that have some characteristics in common with design problems. It is argued in this thesis that existing theories and models explaining the nature of problems and of the processes of solving problems are adequate in explaining many categories of problems and problem-solving but are inadequate in explaining the process of solving design problems. A new model of a problem space is proposed and justified. It is argued that design problems occur within a problem space that consists of a problem zone, a search and construction space and a satisficing zone. To establish, theoretically, the role of visual mental imagery in designing, two bodies of cognitive research literature are employed. Firstly, research into the utility of sketches in problem-solving are examined. This research indicates that external images assist problem-solving. Secondly, research into the relationship between perception and imagery is examined. This research suggests that visual mental images are functionally equivalent to perceived images. Thirdly, by combining the findings on sketches in problem-solving with the findings on imagery and perception, it is then possible to argue that visual mental images can assist problem-solving, and may play an important role in the resolution of complex design problems. The cognitive theory explaining the role of visual mental imagery in problem-solving in design is used to develop predictions for testing in two practical studies. Designers use visual imagery to represent and transform complex design problems within the problem space, and visual images are theorised as capable of providing more efficient representations for solving design problems than other forms of representation such as propositions. In the two studies undertaken in this thesis, a case study methodology was employed. The findings of the two studies support the arguments developed in this thesis that expert designers are able to form more complete and more detailed images of design problems and solutions than novices. Expert designers have a large store of previous solutions that can be retrieved from long-term memory as visual mental images. Expert designers are able to recognise when their existing solutions can be used, how they might be modified for use, and where something new is required. The study examined designing in terms of the deployment of procedures and the relationship among these procedures, and with images usage. It was found that designers traverse the design problem space using generative and exploratory procedures and that these procedures are facilitated by and facilitate, the production of visual mental images. The study provides a model of a problem space that can be used to explain the process of solving complex ill-defined problems, the cognitive processing involved in creative thinking and the role of mental imagery in an information processing theory of problem-solving. Conceptualising the problem space as containing a problem zone, search and construction space and satisficing zone makes it possible to apply the concept of a problem space to problems that do not contain well specified problem and goal states and with a limited number of operators. Integrating imagery theories with information processing theories provides an account of the process of solving complex design problems and the generation of novel solutions.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">architectural design</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">conceptualising space</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050919.170056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Retrospective Review of the Social Impacts of the Tindal RAAF Base on Communities at Katherine, NT</field><field name="creator">Milbourne, Raymond</field><field name="description">In the year 1983/84, the Commonwealth Government decided to redevelop a RAAF airstrip at Tindal into a northern air base in NT. It would replace RAAF Base Darwin that was situated close to the coast and susceptible to both cyclonic weather and any 'enemy' sneak raid attacks. Tindal is located about fifteen kilometres south from Katherine on the Stuart Highway. A social survey conducted in the second half of 1983 formed the basis for SIA predictions that appeared in the EIS. These encompassed social impacts that would occur during the construction phase and later throughout the operational phase. Included among the predicted impacts on local residents was aircraft noise from military aircraft flying overhead and this was confirmed by a social survey conducted in 1994. Other predictions included the integration of a RAAF population with its own set of values into a conservative Katherine community. The social survey of 1994 asks the same type of questions as asked in 1983, and the two sets of answers are compared over time. A subsequent longitudinal analysis follows the structural development of the Katherine population/community. A group of 1994 respondents was found to have resided in Katherine in 1983 and cohort by cohort their state of affairs discovered. As Katherine developed into a regional centre the views of respondents toward the RAAF became more accepting and residual social impacts from the redevelopment phase were difficult to find.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">RAAF</field><field name="subject">Tindal</field><field name="subject">Katherine</field><field name="subject">Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">air force bases</field><field name="subject">military bases</field><field name="subject">aircraft noise</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="subject">impact</field><field name="subject">impacts</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040527.092914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Understudy: The Embodiment of a Life on Stage</field><field name="creator">Millett, Anthony Francis</field><field name="description">This study presents a work of theatre art in the form of an autobiographical monodrama, supported by three exegeses: a review of informing literature, one of the writing process, the third of the critical reactions to the play at different stages of its development by readers and audiences. The thesis considers the two questions, How can theatre depict my autobiography? and How can monodrama be used to express this autobiography? The first question implies an examination of the process of writing and producing an autobiography for the theatre. The second question is answered through the process that developed in this study towards the choice of the form of a monodrama. The methodology emerged as the play was written and a journal recorded. At times the approach, particularly as it affected the writing of the play, was more like action research in which the play was reacted to and then amended in a cyclical manner, the writer also developing new understandings in the process. The reflective process was used to help in understanding the development that was taking place. A survey, and interviews with audience members were conducted as part of the investigation once the artwork was presented. In addition, after the piece had been developed to the point of presentation, it was subjected to critical evaluation, The data from the audience assisted in the development of the artwork as well as developing an understanding of the research question and the possible answers or further questions. The Generic Exegesis arose out of the reading, and developed as an exegesis accompanying the writing of the play once the form of the play had clearly become a monodrama. The Generic Exegesis is designed to show background reading that has informed directly the writing and performing of the play, 'The Changeling'. A principal objective for writing the play developed from a desire to help others to understand something of the conflicts and dilemmas facing adoptees towards the search for self identity and its relationship to acting. Part of the conflict for an adopted person was crystallised in Derridas concept of erasure and the use of the trace to recognise the coexistence of both sides of a binary, which rationalised the splitting of the central character into the two traces, Dominic and Frank. My need for control of the outcome affected the selection from the autobiography, the development of some scenes, and was one of the reasons for the use of fiction. The data for the Process Exegesis came from the journal that was kept during the writing, production, performance and rewrites of the play. The role of the audience had emerged in the interview data and one of the interview questions asked what kind of audience the respondent thought the play suitable for. The Process Exegesis shows that part of the answer to the research question is arrived at through the systematic recording and analysis of the processes that were involved in the writing of the autobiographical play. These have shown that artistic worth was increased as a factor of the distance achieved. The Critical Exegesis showsthat the issues that the play addressed such as adoption and a search for identity were also perceived as important by the readers and the audience. Significant contributions to the development of the play were made by the Dramaturg (Dl) and some cogent points were made by a second dramaturg. The respondents who were interviewed reacted to the content of the play, namely adoption, identity and the issues associated with them, as well as the performance. This study investigates the processes of the development of an autobiographical performance from the generation of the script to the public presentation. It shows that theatre can artistically depict an autobiography and that the perceived appropriate contemporary theatre formis the monodrama. The main issue to be recognised as arising out of the play and the process is that the whole project has been a search for identity. That identity is defined in the range of characters portrayed in the play as well as the process of writing it. The outcome of the investigation was a piece of dramatic performance text that I had written and performed, accompanied by a critical commentary on the creation, production and reception processes.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monodrama</field><field name="subject">autobiography</field><field name="subject">drama</field><field name="subject">play writing</field><field name="subject">process exegesis</field><field name="subject">critical exegesis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050920.081742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systems Thinking and Strategic Decision-Making: A Consideration of Chaos Theory</field><field name="creator">Milliner, Lloyd A</field><field name="description">Strategic decision-making is a fundamental process in business management as strategic decisions affect the long-term health of the organisation. However, a constantly and unpredictably changing business environment, becoming progressively more complex as time passes makes strategy formulation increasingly difficult. Shock events such as terrorist attacks, rapidly spreading communicable diseases, and unexpected business failures of large and well-established companies greatly affect organisations by making it difficult to effectively plan for the future. This thesis contributes to the strategic decision-making literature by investigating the role of shock events in a complex system, namely strategic decision-making. Using chaos/complexity theory as an intellectual platform this thesis argues that strategic decision-making is a complex, open, dynamic and non-linear system and that shock events can represent an opportunity in strategic decision-making. A number of contemporary writers are calling for more integrated models. In response this research proposes a generic and integrative framework that highlights the complexity of strategic decision-making and its processes. The research is qualitative and a single-case study approach was chosen, examining the decision-making processes in a large Australian regional airport. Data collection was triangulated, consisting mainly of in-depth interviews with executives but also included questionnaires, and quantitative and qualitative archival data. It was found that shock events influenced strategic decision-making by causing evolutionary changes in the strategic decision-making processes. In addition it was found that shock events impacted on internal drivers such as cognition and organisational culture. The shock event was perceived as an opportunity, which resulted in changing decision-making processes a change in business strategy. It was concluded that environmental perception, intuition and an opportunity-seeking culture can play an important part in strategic decision-making following a shock event.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic decision-making</field><field name="subject">business management</field><field name="subject">chaos/complexity theory</field><field name="subject">systems thinking</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070212.162743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Faith, Learning and Christian Higher Education</field><field name="creator">Millis, Brian David</field><field name="description">Responding to the absence of readily available models in Australia for thinking about Christian higher education, this thesis investigates what might constitute its foundational principles and distinctive character. The thesis considers the Western Christian tradition, the history of the university, and the contemporary experience of Christian higher education in the United States to identify models for thinking about Christian higher education. It is argued that a central issue to be addressed in developing a distinctively Christian approach to scholarship is the relationship of faith and reason, an issue to which the Christian tradition offers a range of approaches. The question of faith and reason has a wider cultural significance since, it is argued, Western culture is fundamentally constituted by the relationship of Jerusalem and Athens, in which the inherent tensions do not obscure an ultimate commitment to the unity of truth. In contemporary debates over Christian higher education, the concept of faith-learning integration is a central issue. Given the variety of definitions and models proposed, the thesis considers the approaches which have been adopted in the Christian tradition. The approaches of Philo and the Church Fathers to classical learning are considered, with extended attention given to the 'faith seeking understanding' model attributed to St Augustine. Drawing upon Neoplatonism, Augustine's theory of illumination explained why true knowledge was dependent upon divine revelation. Augustine's approach also held that 'all truth is God's truth', and justified the appropriation of classical learning as analogous to the Hebrews 'spoiling Egypt' at the time of the Exodus. The Augustinian approach offers significant insight into the role of the will and the affections in knowing, and justifies belief as a reliance upon authority. While Augustine's is not the only model that might validly be termed 'Christian', and is not without its problems, it is a model which still has much to offer to Christian higher education today. The Augustinian approach has a profound historical significance since it established the epistemological framework for western Christendom throughout the middle ages. In responding to the criticism that the term 'Christian university' is an oxymoron, the thesis also considers aspects of the history of the medieval and Reformation universities, seeking to establish the extent to which it is possible for the university to be regarded as a Christian institution. It is argued that the university did not arise out of the rediscovery of Aristotelian philosophy, and that it is indeed possible to regard the university as a Christian institution for much of its history. The possibility of a Christian university today is thus not inconsistent with the history and institutional character of the university. The contributions to thinking about faith and learning and Christian higher education of Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and John Henry Newman are also discussed. One of the critical tasks of Christian higher education generally, and of a Christian university specifically, is the synthesis or integration of faith and learning, of which both Augustine and Thomas Aquinas were exemplars. It is argued however that, while the Thomistic approach can validly be termed 'Christian', it has been more successfully pursued in Catholic institutions than in their Protestant counterparts in which a central authority to regulate the boundaries of the domains of faith and reason is absent. A critical issue for Christian higher education today is that of secularising pressures, and thus the recent history of the secularisation of Christian higher education institutions in the United States is also considered. It is argued that the secularisation of these institutions was due particularly to the view of faith and learning which they had adopted. The study concludes that the 'worldview' approach advocated by Abraham Kuyper offers an approach to scholarship which is both resistant to secularisation, and consistent with the Christian tradition, particularly as expressed by Augustine and Calvin.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western Christian tradition</field><field name="subject">Christian higher education</field><field name="subject">Neoplatonism</field><field name="subject">Augustinian theory</field><field name="subject">Abraham Kuyper</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061019.120201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A New Policy-Making Instrument? The First Australian Consensus Conference</field><field name="creator">Mohr, Alison</field><field name="description">Consensus conferences evolved as a response to the public's increasing dissatisfaction with technocratic decision-making processes that are judged to have repeatedly failed to serve its interests. The staging of the first Australian consensus conference at Old Parliament House in Canberra in March 1999 therefore presented an ideal opportunity to analyse the evolution of this new kind of policy input from its conception through to its implementation and subsequent evaluation. This thesis set out to provide an analysis of that trajectory using elements of the theoretical approach known as actor-network theory (ANT). Previous analyses of consensus conferences have generally provided only limited evaluations of single aspects of the entire process of setting up, implementing and evaluating such a conference. Furthermore, many of the early evaluations were conducted by reviewers or units which were themselves internal to the consensus conference under scrutiny. My own analysis has tried to offer broader, although inevitably less detailed, coverage, using a perspective from contemporary social theory that offers particular advantages in analysing the creation of short-term networks designed for specific purposes. By describing and analysing the role of this relatively new policy-making instrument, I have explored the different sub-networks that operate within the consensus conference process by focussing on the ways in which the conference was organised and how the relationships between the organisers and the participants helped to shape the outcomes. Thus the entire consensus conference sequence from idea to outcome can be thought of as a construction of a network to achieve at least one immediate goal. That goal was a single potential policy input, a consensus position embodied in the report of the lay panel. To realise that goal, the network needed to be recruited and stabilised and its members made to converge on that collective statement. But how is it that a range of disparate actors, including lay and expert, are mobilised to achieve that particular goal and what are the stabilisation devices which enable, or fail to enable this goal to be reached? In the context of the first Australian consensus conference, three key alignment devices emerged: texts, money and people. Yet it is clear from the evidence that some of these network stabilisation devices functioned poorly or not at all. This thesis has drawn attention to the areas in which they were weak and what importance that weakness had for the kind of policy outcome the consensus conference achieved. The role and extent of these powerful stabilisation devices in networks was therefore a vital issue for analysis. If one of the criteria to evaluate the success of a consensus conference is that it provides the stimulus to hold another, then the Australian conference must be deemed so far a failure. No further Australian consensus conference is planned. However, Australia stands to forfeit a number of advantages if no further consensus conferences or similar occasions are organised. Policy formation in contemporary democracies has had to accommodate an increasing array of new participants in order to track more effectively the diversity of potentially significant opinions on complex policy issues. This process requires new and transparent ways to educate and inform the public on policy issues and to ensure that policy makers are better informed about the needs and concerns of their community. As the evidence presented in thesis for the Australian example and its predecessors overseas suggests, consensus conferences have the potential to play a role in the contemporary policy-making context. But the realisation of that potential will vary according to their institutional contexts and the capacity of the actors to create the temporarily most stable and productive network out of the heterogeneous human and material resources to hand.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">policy-making</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">actor-network theory</field><field name="subject">ANT</field><field name="subject">consensus</field><field name="subject">consensus conferences</field><field name="subject">consensus development conferences</field><field name="subject">political participation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030707.075312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational Change and Accounting Control Systems at an Australian University  A Longitudinal Case Study</field><field name="creator">Moll, Jodie</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an attempt to better understand the design and operation of accounting control systems as part of an interrelated control package in an Australian higher education institution subject to an increasingly competitive environment. The study was designed: (1) to understand how and why the accounting control systems changed; (2) to understand how accounting shapes and can be shaped by other institutional processes; and (3) to understand the roles accounting control systems play in higher education institutions.   The research aims and objectives lend to a longitudinal case study approach. The data collection consisted of two phases: (1) a pilot study to determine issues for the intensive study and to identify or develop a suitable theoretical framework; and (2) an intensive field study of the subject organisation to develop and explain the observations. Data collection involved a triangulation approach that mixes three sources: interview, observation, and document evidence over a two-year period between 2000 and 2002. The interviewees were selected from different hierarchical levels: Vice-Chancellor, Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Deans, Heads of School, general staff, and Education Queensland.   This thesis draws on multiple theoretical perspectives to understand the complexities of accounting control systems change. These perspectives are: institutional theory, leadership theories, political and power theories, and resistance theories. Such an emergent research strategy was deemed pertinent to build a more holistic analysis and to offer alternative explanations of the phenomena under scrutiny.   The case highlights a number of findings. First, despite the suggestion that universities operate as autonomous institutions, the University studied still succumbed to external pressures, especially from the Federal Government, for a more managerialist approach. In this study Federal Government pressures were the primary source of change identified. Second, the design and operation of the accounting control systems was found to be contingent on the related control systems and vice versa. Third, the accounting control systems played several roles in the organisation. In particular, they provided visibility to external constituents giving the impression that rational techniques had been employed consistent with Government prescriptions. This was the case for both the budget system and the performance management system. In addition to this, from an internal perspective, the budget was used to promote a sense of equity and fairness, at the same time reducing conflict in the organisation. Finally, the budget system was found to be a source of power in the organisation; it determined the level of control used to direct organisational activity. Implications for future research are presented in the concluding section.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accounting Control System</field><field name="subject">Higher Education</field><field name="subject">Management Control System</field><field name="subject">Public Sector Reform</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030407.133112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preventing Adolescent Depression With Sustainable Resources: Evaluation of a School-Based Universal Effectiveness Trial</field><field name="creator">Montague, Roslyn M.</field><field name="description">Adolescent depression is highly prevalent, associated with negative effects and likely to recur, this provides a cogent argument for finding sustainable, cost-effective, developmentally appropriate approaches to preventing depression. Although there is good evidence to support efficacy, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of programs preventing adolescent depression. Thus the primary aim of this thesis is to evaluate the effectiveness of a universal, school-based, adolescent depression prevention program when implemented by teachers and local mental health professionals. Participants were 1003 secondary school students drawn from three pairs of matched Year 9 cohorts. The three pairs were assigned to either: (a) Resourceful Adolescent Program (RAP), an 11-session school-based resilience program delivered as part of the school curriculum (n = 522) or (b) a comparison condition (n = 481). All students completed measures of depressive symptoms and hopelessness at pre-intervention, post-intervention and 6-month follow-up. The intervention group completed quantitative and qualitative evaluations of perceived program benefit. Small program effects on depressive symptoms for the RAP group were evident for the whole group at post-intervention (ES = 0.30) and for girls only at follow-up (ES = 0.35). However, both boys' and girls' self-reports indicated very positive overall benefits from the RAP intervention. Teachers were not less effective as group leaders than mental health professionals in terms of outcomes on depression measures, perceived program benefits or acceptability to students. Public health implications of this population-based approach are discussed in the light of small effects, high recruitment rates and potential use of sustainable school resources.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">mental depression</field><field name="subject">adolescent</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030605.152529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nurses and Post-Mortem Care: A Study of Stress and the Ways of Coping</field><field name="creator">Mooney, Deborah Claire</field><field name="description">In three separate studies, this thesis examined stress and coping in nurse practitioners during first time exposure to post-mortem care. Using a self report questionnaire and a retrospective design, Study 1 (N=97) examined the nurse's first experience administering post-mortem care to the recently deceased. The results obtained from this exploratory investigation established that many nurses reported significant distress and used emotion-focused coping strategies (avoidance and palliation) to manage the experience. These data are consistent with those reported by others who have researched in the area, and support the hypotheses that first time exposure to post-mortem care can induce significant distress in some nurses, and that the memory is vividly recalled many years after the event.  The second study used a prospective design. Base line data were collected prior to the nurse performing post-mortem care (N=59), 24 hours after they participated in their first post-mortem care procedure, and 1 and 5 weeks post-event. The General Health Questionnaire-28, the Revised Ways of Coping Checklist, the Revised Collett-Lester Fear of Death and Dying Scale, and the  Impact of Event Scale were used to obtain data which were compared with that of a control group (N=59) of nurses undertaking an academic examination. The results confirmed that beginning nurse practitioners resort to using predominantly emotion-focused coping strategies when faced with stressful life events.  Moreover, a direct linear relationship between the participants' fear of death and dying scores and the way they rated the impact of performing post-mortem care was found. Colaizzi's (1978) method of data analysis was used in the third and final study in the series (N=6) that explored the lived experience of nurses performing post-mortem care. The essence of the first experience was embedded in six key themes that structured the lived experience. Psychic disorganisation was experienced by the participants because they were unprepared both psychologically and educationally to deal with the experience and resorted to using emotion-focused coping strategies. It is concluded that nurses' first exposure to post-mortem care procedures is stressful and they use predominately emotion focused coping strategies to deal with the experience.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">post-mortem care</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030815.145040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silent Violence: Australia's White Stolen Children</field><field name="creator">Moor, Merryl</field><field name="description">This thesis makes a significant contribution to the existing knowledge on 'unmarried mothers'. Much of the literature on 'unmarried mothers' has been written by white, male, middle-class professionals who assume that unwed mothers are happy to place their babies for adoption so that they can be free to pursue other interests, meet other men and make a new life. However, after interviewing many of the mothers who gave up their babies in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s in Australia, I found this was not the case. Many of the mothers had wanted to keep their babies but were forced to relinquish them by their families and the wider society who seemed more intent on upholding nuclear family values than making available the resources needed to keep natural mothers and their babies together. My argument throughout this thesis is that given a choice - a viable economic and socially supported choice - many of the unmarried mothers, typified by those whom I interviewed, would not have parted with their babies. Most mothers interviewed, and presumably many of those in the community at large, have experienced much pain and grief as a result of the separation - a grief which is profound and lasts forever. Using Marxist feminist theories of the state and post-structural theories, my thesis highlights the perceptions and memories of birthmothers about the birthing experience and adoption as experience, process and life consequence. I also argue that the removal of white, working-class babies from their mothers compares in some small way with the removal of the indigenous 'stolen children' in the same period. The removal of Aboriginal children from their homes and cultures has been referred to by some scholars and activists as a form of cultural genocide. While the removal of babies from white, working-class, unwed mothers was different in that it had few racial implications, I argue that the system in place at the time was patriarchal and class-based and as such left the young, unwed women with no options but adoption. The thesis makes a very important and socially significant contribution to our understanding of unmarried mothers in that it presents a largely unwritten history of women. Rich in the voices of unmarried mothers, there are important conceptual, empirical and practical policy implications flowing from the research findings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adoption</field><field name="subject">unmarried mothers (Australia)</field><field name="subject">maternal grief of separation</field><field name="subject">patriarchal society</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070111.172012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of the Biocatalytic Component in a Ferricyanide Mediated Approach to Rapid Biochemical Oxygen Demand Analysis</field><field name="creator">Morris, Kristy</field><field name="description">A novel rapid method for the determination of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) has been developed. By replacing oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor in the microbial oxidation of organic substrate, with the ferricyanide ion, a significant increase in the rate of the biochemical reaction could be achieved. This arises from the high solubility of the ferricyanide ion (compared to oxygen); therefore allowing for elevated microbial populations without rapid depletion of the electron acceptor. Therefore, the BOD of a sample can be determined within 1-3 hours compared to 5-days with the standard BOD5 assay. A range of microorganisms were shown to be able to use the ferricyanide ion as an alternative electron acceptor for the biodegradation of a range of organic compounds in the ferricyanide mediated BOD (FM-BOD) assay. The most suitable biocatalyst in the FM-BOD method, however, was shown to be a mixture of microorganisms that was capable of degrading large amounts and types of compounds. These mixed consortia of microorganisms included a synthetic mixture prepared in our laboratory and two commercially available consortia, BODseedTM and Bi-ChemTM. When these seed materials were employed in the FM-BOD assay, the method was shown to closely estimate the BOD5 values of real wastewater samples. The linear dynamic working range of the FM-BOD method was also greatly extended compared to the standard BOD5 assay (nearly 50 times greater) and other oxygen based BOD biosensors. The immobilisation of the microbial consortia by both gel entrapment and freeze-drying methods was shown to greatly reduce the preparation and handling time of the mixed consortia for use in the FM-BOD method. Immobilisation of the mixed microbial consortium in LentiKats&#174;, a PVA hydrogel, resulted in a marked increase in the stability of the biocatalyst. Diffusion limitations resulting from the gel matrix, however, reduced the rate and extent of the bioreaction as well as the linear dynamic working range of the method. Freeze-drying techniques were shown to circumvent some of the limitations identified with gel entrapment for the immobilisation of the mixed consortia. The freeze-dried consortia could be used off-the-shelf and demonstrated reduced diffusional restrictions. A marked decrease in the viability of the microorganisms was observed directly following the freeze-drying process and in subsequent storage. Carrageenan, however, was shown to afford a significant degree a protection to the cells during the freeze-drying process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemical oxygen demand</field><field name="subject">ferricyanide ion</field><field name="subject">biocatalytic component</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060906.121244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Altitudinal Variation in the Life History of Anurans in Southeast Queensland</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Fiona Clare</field><field name="description">Global declines and disappearances of amphibians from high altitude, pristine habitats have been reported in recent years. To date the cause of many of these declines and/or disappearances has not been identified. Although it is well documented that life history characteristics of temperate amphibians are influenced by altitude (due to systematic variation of temperature with altitude), little work has been carried out on the effects of altitude on Australian anurans. This lack of ecological data is a major impediment to identifying the causal factors responsible for amphibian declines. Due to differences in life history characteristics, high altitude populations may be less resilient than their lowland counterparts and subsequently may be more vulnerable to extinction. Consequently, the main aim of this study was to determine whether altitude influenced life history characteristics and ultimately population resilience of anurans in the southeast Queensland region. Six anuran species; Litoria chloris, L. lesueuri, L. pearsoniana (Anura: Hylidae), Mixophyes fasciolatus, M. fleayi and M. iteratus (Anura: Myobatrachidae) were studied over three field seasons (1997-1999) in 18 sites of varying altitude (100-950m) in the southeast Queensland region. The life history characteristics examined were: activity and breeding season length, fecundity and egg size, number of clutches produced per season, tadpole growth and development rates, longevity, age at maturity, reproductive life span, average lifetime fecundity, survival and recapture rates. The data were collected using a combination of field-based surveys (body sizes, clutch sizes, and survival and recapture rates), museum specimen dissections (clutch and egg sizes), reciprocal transplant field experiments (tadpole growth and development rates) and skeletochronology (longevity, age at maturity, reproductive lifespan and average lifetime fecundity). On average, high altitude populations of all species had shorter breeding and activity seasons than low altitude populations (up to 10 weeks less in some cases). The magnitude of the difference in breeding season length varied among years depending on the average temperature and rainfall for the year; i.e. differences appeared greater in warmer and wetter years. Within a population males had longer breeding and activity seasons than females. Although breeding season length varied with altitude, the number of nights that individuals were active within the breeding season did not vary; i.e. low altitude populations were not active for more nights despite having a longer breeding season. This result was attributed to the absence of a relationship between individual activity and environmental variables (air temperature, rainfall, etc.) in many of the populations. Generally, intraspecific clutch size did not vary significantly with altitude. This result was due to the absence of a significant relationship between female body size and altitude (as clutch size is proportional to female body size). Egg size also did not vary with altitude however, suggesting egg size may be canalized (i.e. fixed) in these species. Results also suggest that females of these species only produce one clutch of eggs per season. Interspecific differences in reproductive characteristics largely reflected differences in reproductive mode, larval habitat and female body size. Altitude negatively influenced growth and development rates in L. chloris and development rates in L. pearsoniana. Tadpoles raised at high altitudes were also generally larger at each Gosner Development Stage in both species. The results of the reciprocal transplant experiments suggested that most of the variation in growth and development rates was due to environmental factors (water temperature) rather than genetic or maternal factors. Altitude or genetic factors did not significantly affect tadpole survival in either species. The results suggest that tadpoles occurring at high altitudes take longer to reach metamorphosis and do so at a larger size than their lowland counterparts. With the exception of L. lesueuri, skeletochronology was suitable for age estimation in the study species. Altitude had a significant effect on the age at maturity or longevity in some of the species, however there were trends toward older individuals and older ages at maturity in high altitude populations for the remaining species. Females were generally older than males for all species and in the case of longer-lived species (i.e. Mixophyes spp.) also tended to be older when breeding for the first time. The large overlap of body sizes of individuals of different ages demonstrates that body size is a poor indicator of age in these species. This is the first study to estimate average lifetime fecundity for more than one amphibian species and/or population. The results suggest that the absence of significant altitudinal variation in the average lifetime fecundity of different populations is due to tradeoffs made by females (current reproduction vs. survival). There was no significant altitudinal variation in annual survival and recapture rates in any of the species, and generally there was no difference in the survival and recapture rates of males and females in each population. Within a year, monthly survival and recapture rates were more variable at low than high altitudes and this was attributed to the longer breeding season of low altitude populations. The results did not support previous studies that suggested there was a size bias in survival and recapture rates. The shorter breeding seasons, slower growth and development rates, older age at maturity and greater longevity found in the high altitude study populations will result in increased generation time in those populations. In turn, increased generation time can cause high altitude populations to be less resilient (i.e. population takes longer to return to equilibrium after a disturbance away from equilibrium) (Pimm et al. 1988, Pimm 1991) and ultimately more vulnerable or prone to extinction or decline. The majority of unexplained global amphibian declines have occurred at high altitudes in tropical and subtropical areas. These latitudinal patterns may be explained by the narrow range of environmental tolerances exhibited by tropical organisms resulting in mountains being effectively &#147;higher&#148; in the tropics. Consequently, high altitude tropical species are likely to be even more vulnerable than temperate species occurring at similar altitudes. Further work on the effects of geographic variation, especially interactions between altitude and latitude are needed to evaluate the hypotheses for the causes of these declines and disappearances.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anurans</field><field name="subject">Anura</field><field name="subject">frogs</field><field name="subject">frog</field><field name="subject">Southeast Queensland</field><field name="subject">high altitude ecology</field><field name="subject">altitudinal variation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031125.120847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the Student Attrition Process and the Contribution of Peer-Mentoring Interventions in an Australian First Year University Program</field><field name="creator">Muckert, Tammy Deanne</field><field name="description">This program of research had two related aims: (1) to explore the problem of student attrition in the context of an Australian higher education institution, and (2) to investigate the efficacy of peer-mentoring as a retention strategy.   Participants in this program of research were students commencing first-year studies in the School of Applied Psychology across two cohort years: 1996 and 1997.  In 1996, a classic pre-test/post-test experimental design was adopted, with students (N = 118) randomly assigned to either a peer-mentoring treatment group or a control group.  In 1997, while a classic pre-test/post-test design was also adopted, all students from this year (N = 162) participated in the peer-mentoring program.  Thus, it was intended that the 1996 control group would be utilised for comparison with both the 1996 and 1997 treatment groups. Students were surveyed pre- and post-intervention across a number of personal, demographic, and academic achievement (e.g., tertiary entrance rank, and grade point average) variables.  Students&#146; academic integration, social integration, institutional commitment, and goal commitment were measured using the Institutional Integration Scales (adapted from Pascarella and Terenzini, 1980).  Students participating in the peer-mentoring program also completed a range of measures in order to evaluate its efficacy. The first part of the research program focused on the measurement and prediction of student retention and academic performance.  The results of confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a six first-order factor solution provided the most parsimonious explanation of students&#146; responses to the Institutional Integration Scales.  The six Institutional Integration Scales demonstrated moderate to good levels of reliability, with results being comparable to those achieved in previous studies. The results of structural equations modelling analyses suggested that students&#146; peer group interactions influenced their interactions with faculty, and both of these factors, along with their faculty concern for student development and teaching, influenced students&#146; academic and intellectual development, which in turn influenced students&#146; institutional and goal commitments.  These results were taken to indicate the potential value of peer-based processes in aiding students&#146; institutional and goal commitment and subsequently reducing levels of student attrition. Given that significant differences were found between the 1996 and 1997 cohorts on a number of pre-test measures and other key indicators, investigations regarding significant predictors of students&#146; re-enrolment into second year and their first year grade point average were conducted separately for the two cohorts.  The results of logistic regression analyses indicated that students&#146; first year grade point average was the only consistent and significant predictor of their re-enrolment into the second year of study across the two cohorts.  Multiple regression analyses revealed that students&#146; tertiary entrance ranks and previous university attendance were consistently significant predictors of their first year grade point average across the two cohorts. Equipped with a better understanding of the factors that affect student attrition and academic performance, as well as the relationship between those factors, the second part of the thesis focused on the efficacy of two formal, group-based peer-mentoring relationships in assisting first year students make a successful transition to university.  However, given that significant differences were found between the 1996 and 1997 cohorts on a number of pre-test measures and other key indicators, it was not possible to evaluate the efficacy of the 1997 peer-mentoring program relative to either the 1996 peer-mentoring program or control group.  Nevertheless, the 1996 treatment and control condition groups were found to be equivalent on pre-test measures and indices, and thus were able to be compared.  Overall, the results of a series of one-way ANOVAs revealed that the 1996 peer-mentoring program was found to have a positive effect on enhancing students&#146; re-enrolment into second year, persistence intentions, academic performance and self-reported adjustment, which was consistent with the direction of findings in previous studies.  However, for a range of reasons, the effect of the 1996 peer-mentoring program on a number of these variables was not strong enough to reach statistical significance.  Although there were trends towards significant differences between the 1996 treatment and control groups on a number of variables (i.e., students in the 1996 peer-mentoring program evidenced higher grades in PB11002: Introduction to Cognitive and Biological Psychology; and PB11008: Research Methods and Statistics; as well as higher scores on the Peer Group Interactions scale than students in the control group), the only significant positive difference of the 1996 peer-mentoring program was the improvement of students&#146; academic performance in one first year subject (i.e., PB11006, Introduction to Research in the Behavioural Sciences). Finally, exploratory factor analyses and reliability analysis of a mentoring functions scale revealed strong support for the presence of one, highly reliable, general mentoring function.   Both the 1996 and 1997 program participants&#146; ratings of the performance of this general mentoring function were significantly and positively correlated with their self-reported academic and intellectual development.  In addition, the 1997 program participants&#146; ratings of the performance of this general mentoring function were significantly and positively correlated to their self-reported peer group interactions, institutional commitments, goal commitments, and persistence intentions.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">student retention</field><field name="subject">first year university students</field><field name="subject">student adjustment</field><field name="subject">peer mentoring</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030226.171200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of Capture, Fibre Wetting and Flow Processes in Wet Filtration and Liquid Aerosol Filtration</field><field name="creator">Mullins, Benjamin James</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the particle capture, fibre wetting and droplet flow processes within wet filters collecting solid and liquid aerosols and within filters collecting only liquid aerosols.  The processes involved in this type of filtration were examined through a series of experiments and models developed to describe the behaviour of fibre/liquid systems.  This work can be summarized in 4 categories:  (1) The bounce and immediate re-entrainment of liquid and solid monodisperse aerosols under a stable filtration regime (pre cake formation) by wet and dry fibrous filters.  In this work it was found that the solid particles generally exhibited a lower fractional filtration efficiency than liquid particles (of the same size), although this difference decreased in the smaller size fractions.  However, for the wet filtration regime (each fibre of the filter was coated by a film of water), no significant difference in filtration efficiency was detectable between solid and liquid aerosols.  Either the bounce effect of the particles is inhibited by the liquid film, or the filtration conditions in the wet filter are so different that the aerosol properties are less significant with respect to capture. (2) A microscopic study of the effect of fibre orientation on the fibre wetting process and flow of liquid droplets along filter fibres when subjected to airflow and gravity forces was conducted. The flow of the liquid collected by the fibres was observed and measured using a specially developed micro-cell, detailed in the thesis.  The experimental results were compared to a theoretical model developed to describe the flow of droplets on fibres.  The theory and experimental results showed a good agreement.  A sensitivity analysis of the model was performed which showed the droplet radius to be the most significant parameter.  The model has the potential to improve filter self-cleaning and minimise water use. (3) An experimental study of the capture of solid and liquid (oil) aerosols on fibrous filters wetted with water. Variable quantities of liquid irrigation were used, and the possibility for subsequent fibre regeneration after clogging or drying was also studied. It was found that self-cleaning (removal of solid aerosols by water) occurred even under heavily dust-laden conditions, and post evaporation of water.  With the collection of oil aerosols on fibres wetted with water, a predominance of the barrel shaped droplet on the fibre was observed, with oil droplets displacing water droplets (if the oil and fibre combination created a barrel shaped droplet), creating various compound droplets of oil and water not previously reported in literature.  (4)  An extensive experimental investigation of the wetting processes of fibre/liquid systems during air filtration (when drag and gravitational forces are acting) has shown many important features, including droplet extension, oscillatory motion, and detachment from fibres as airflow velocity increases.  The droplet oscillation is believed to be induced by the onset of the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as droplet size increases.  To model such oscillation it was necessary to create a new conceptual model to account for the forces both inducing and preventing such oscillation.  The agreement between the model and experimental results is satisfactory for both the radial and transverse oscillations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">liquid aerosol filtration</field><field name="subject">liquid aerosols</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">wetting</field><field name="subject">droplet</field><field name="subject">droplets</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">particle</field><field name="subject">particles</field><field name="subject">particulate</field><field name="subject">particulates</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040919.124658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Elevation and Venous Occlusion Pressure on Cardiovascular Function in Physically Active Men Who Are Paraplegic</field><field name="creator">Mungovan, Sean F.</field><field name="description">The purpose of the present investigation was to: 1) Determine the relationship between cardiac output (estimated using the acetylene rebreathing methodology) and oxygen consumption in a homogeneous group of men who are paraplegic. 2) Investigate whether lower limb elevation increases stroke volume and decreases heart rate at rest and during submaximal arm exercise. 3) Investigate whether the application of constant circumferential pneumatic pressure applied to dependent lower limbs increases stroke volume and decreases heart rate at rest and during submaximal arm exercise.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paraplegic men</field><field name="subject">paraplegics</field><field name="subject">paraplegia</field><field name="subject">venous occlusion pressure</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular</field><field name="subject">cardiac</field><field name="subject">oxygen consumption</field><field name="subject">heart rate</field><field name="subject">lower limb elevation</field><field name="subject">limbs</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040917.084824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Re-evaluation of the 'Death of God' Theology</field><field name="creator">Munro, Howard Richard John</field><field name="description">Although the &#145;death of God&#146; theology attracted considerable attention during the 1960s, in recent decades it has fallen into neglect. Nonetheless, the issues raised by the &#145;death of God&#146; theology were important ones and it remains an interesting question whether the &#145;death of God&#146; theologians were able to make substantial contributions to them. This thesis re-examines the work of the &#145;death of God&#146; theologians. It argues that the popular view &#150; that the &#145;death of God&#146; theology represented a common tendency, or movement, towards atheism among certain prominent American Protestant theologians &#150; is mistaken. Through a series of detailed studies of Thomas J.J. Altizer (chapters 3 and 4), William Hamilton (Chapter 5), Paul van Buren (Chapter 6), and Harvey Cox (Chapter 7), the thesis shows not only that the significance of the &#145;death of God&#146; theologians has been widely misinterpreted, but that their work contains a number of features which have been under-emphasised or even overlooked. The aim of the thesis is to provide a more balanced contemporary reading of their work. The work of Altizer receives special attention and a case is made for the view that he should be read as a Protestant mystic of a peculiar sort.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">'death of God'</field><field name="subject">Altizer</field><field name="subject">Hamilton</field><field name="subject">Van Buren</field><field name="subject">Cox</field><field name="subject">mysticism</field><field name="subject">atheism</field><field name="subject">Hegel</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">apocalypticism</field><field name="subject">eschatology</field><field name="subject">'all in all'</field><field name="subject">Protestant romanticism</field><field name="subject">Barth</field><field name="subject">Tillich</field><field name="subject">Kierkegaard</field><field name="subject">Eliade</field><field name="subject">theology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030228.102238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Economy Initial and Seasoned Equity Offers in Australia</field><field name="creator">Murgulov, Zoltan</field><field name="description">Public media and previous research have focused mainly on listing day returns of initial public offers (IPOs) by new economy companies in specific periods such as before April 2000, without examining any subsequent equity offers by new economy companies. This study addresses the issue of multiple equity offers and provides additional understanding of new economy initial and seasoned equity offers (SEOs). Without, a priori, favouring any existing explanation of initial and long-term share returns, this research tests a wide range of theories in order to provide insight into share returns of equity offerings by new economy companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange between 1994 and 2004. In general, this thesis documents the ability of publicly available information (obtained from offer documents and company announcements to the market) to explain the returns of equity-issuing new economy companies in Australia. In other words, how useful is public information in the valuation of initial and seasoned equity offers of new economy stocks? Specifically, the thesis seeks to examine the ability of public information to explain (a) listing day and long-term returns subsequent to initial public offers by new economy companies, and the probability of IPO withdrawal, (b) announcement period and long-term returns of seasoned equity offers by new economy companies, and  (c) the relationships between the initial and any subsequent equity offers by new economy companies (within three years of listing) in terms of probability of seasoned equity offer, duration between the IPO and the first SEO, and frequency of seasoned equity offers within the first three years of IPO. First, the thesis finds that public information is used by investors to value new economy stocks on listing day and in the long run. The negative effect of withdrawal probability on listing day returns of successful IPOs is confirmed in this thesis in the context of the fixed-price offer process in the new economy sector in Australia. While new economy equity-issuing companies have inferior long-term returns compared to the market index and the small capitalisation stock index, they do not underperform relative to their respective industry index returns. Second, this study also finds that public information can explain new economy stock returns around the announcements of seasoned offers and in the long run. Third, the results reveal that publicly available information can be used to explain the incidence and to estimate the probability of seasoned equity offers by recent new economy IPOs. Furthermore, it is found that public information has the ability to explain the duration between the IPO and the first seasoned offer, as well as the frequency of seasoned offers in the first three years after listing. The results of the study support the theoretical predictions about the effects of public information (representing IPO characteristics) and the incidence of a seasoned equity offer. In particular, IPO quality signalling by retained ownership and by underpricing, and the market feedback effect of post-IPO returns have been confirmed for new economy equity offers in Australia. Underpriced new economy IPOs and those with greater proportion of ownership retained after the offer are significantly more likely to have a seasoned equity offer within three years of listing. Likewise, new economy IPOs with superior aftermarket returns are significantly more likely to have a seasoned equity offer. The implication of this research is that public information contained in offer documents and in company announcements is important to valuation of the Australian Stock Exchange listed new economy companies. Thus, the regulators and the Stock Exchange should continue to insist on a high level of information disclosure prior to equity offers in order to enable investors to properly value companies within the new economy sector.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Initial public offers</field><field name="subject">seasoned equity offers</field><field name="subject">Australian Stock Exchange</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070717.160534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orientations to Research Higher Degree Supervision: The Interrelatedness of Beliefs about Supervision, Research, Teaching and Learning</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Noela Winifred</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of research higher degree supervision and thereby its enhancement. My study departs from the current emphasis on issues of practice to offer a set of scholarly understandings embedded in the beliefs that supervisors and candidates hold about supervision and closely related academic mailers. It is aligned with the movement over the past two decades towards concentrating on understanding why teachers and students behave in particular ways, rather than describing what they do and how they do it. I draw on the literature of research higher degree (RI-ID) supervision, the conceptual framework of beliefs research and Gadamer's concept of the hermeneutic circle to argue that supervision is best understood as a plexus of closely related educational beliefs about research, teaching, learning and supervision. Research from this perspective acknowledges supervisions plural, multifunctional character and its holistic nature. The beliefs construct recognises the powerful effect that individualsibeliefs and attitudes have on the way they define educational tasks, make related decisions and prefer to act. Thirty-four participants from one engineering faculty were interviewed about their beliefs about the four components of the supervision plexus. Entire transcripts were coded, using a three-phase, inductive method of analysis incorporating constant-comparative techniques and conceptual field principles, to reveal individuals integrated thinking about the whole process of supervision. This method ensures that the findings remain embedded in the data and retain the richness of individual experience. I identified four different core tendencies to the plexus, based on two bipolar frames - controlling/guiding and task-focussed/person-focussed kinds of beliefs. The result is four global orientations to supervision: controlling/task-focussed, controlling/person-focussed, guiding/task-focussed and guiding/person-focussed. Subcategories accommodate individuals whose beliefs differ in specific aspects but whose focal beliefs fit the global group. Each orientation is elaborated by an orientation belief profile - an integrated system of beliefs about the aspects of the plexus that are common to the individuals in that category iso the profiles describe the orientations as much as they describe the individuals in each category. The beliefs in each profile are organised into six belief clusters and different dimensions of the beliefs describe each orientation. To show the location, density and type of inter-linkages among beliefs and belief clusters orientation webs were drawn. The four webs exhibit a high degree of interconnectedness among beliefs, confirming my contention of a supervision plexus of co-dependent and logically interrelated components. Research findings indicate that practitioners beliefs about teaching are central and powerful in determining their supervisory goals and their predisposition towards particular pedagogical approaches to achieving them. With this advanced understanding of the pedagogy of supervision, a case is built for viewing research higher degree supervision as a teaching activity within the university, and positing its management as a 'joint portfolio' between the teaching and learning centre and the research centre of the university. Other findings are that controlling/task-focussed beliefs are generally favoured by RI-ID candidates and that guiding/person-focussed beliefs more commonly describe the way supervisors think about supervision. Although their strategic enactment may differ according to circumstance, beliefs were found to be consistent across contexts. The supervisors role in shaping candidates' beliefs is seen to be diminished by the influence of candidates' preexisting beliefs about teaching. The study establishes a variety of understandings about supervision within this one engineering faculty, suggesting that pedagogical understandings may be more powerful than disciplinary expectations and attitudes as determinants of supervisory behaviour. The view of RI-ID supervision discussed in this thesis builds on the earlier research in meaningful ways that enhance our understanding of the process as a whole. The thesis provides possibilities for linking that research with more fruitful and rewarding doctoral experiences for supervisors and candidates.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Research higher degree supervision</field><field name="subject">teaching and learning</field><field name="subject">academic research</field><field name="subject">supervision</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051130.172036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination of the Influence the Broader Insurance-Based Rehabilitation Context has on the Experience of Work Stress Among Rehabilitation Professionals</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Patricia</field><field name="description">The phenomenon of work stress is ubiquitous and has been the source of considerable attention over the past few decades. Work stress is a common problem in human services, particularly in the area of rehabilitation. The prevalence of this problem for rehabilitation has, however, been fuelled over the last two decades by the rapid growth of the insurance-based rehabilitation sector in Australia. The expansion of this sector has created a major market for rehabilitation practitioners.  Using a qualitative research paradigm, the current study examined the insurance-based rehabilitation context in Australia.  Specifically, this study explored the influence of this context on the experience of work stress for rehabilitation professionals.  Although attempts to account for work stress usually focus on the qualities of the individual and organizational factors, the current study has responded to the call in occupational stress literature to examine this phenomenon at a broader, contextual level.  Twenty-five rehabilitation professionals were asked to provide visual representations to illustrate their experience of the insurance-based rehabilitation work context.  Interviews were conducted with each participant to elicit a more in-depth understanding of this experience. The findings revealed that the insurance-context appears to be characterized by inconsistency, chaos, confusion, and a strong focus on profit and cost effectiveness as depicted by the themes Maelstrom, Co-dependent Liaisons, Implosion of Responsibility, Legislative Pluralism, External Trumping and Greed.  The deleterious influence of this context on rehabilitation professionals manifested in several ways as represented by the themes Impotence, Cynicism, Going Through the Motions, and Betrayal.  A metaphor of a virus was used to provide a context for understanding how rehabilitation professionals were infected by the stressors inherent in the unhealthy contextual environment of the insurance sector.  The results of this study have important implications for informing future policy, practice and research within the rehabilitation industry.  Clearly, the health of the insurance sector needs to improve to ensure the well-being of rehabilitation professionals such as those who participated in this study.  Improved health of this sector must include a greater respect for the profession of rehabilitation. Also crucial to the improved health of the sector is consistency in legislation and procedures that underpin rehabilitation.  In addition, rehabilitation professionals must accept responsibility for enhancing their core competencies if they are to inoculate themselves against the harmful influence of the broader insurance context.  Strategies to inoculate rehabilitation professionals against the infiltration of these contextual stressors must include an understanding of business administration and policy.  Finally, the findings suggest that unless the health of the sector and the rehabilitation professionals improve, poor rehabilitation outcomes are likely to continue to plague the insurance industry and the experience of work stress and turnover among rehabilitation professionals will remain unacceptably high.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">work stress</field><field name="subject">insurance-based rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">human services</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040629.160954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Critical Analysis of Communicative Planning Theory as a Theoretical Underpinning for Integrated Resource and Environmental Management</field><field name="creator">Murray, Daniel James</field><field name="description">Regional natural resource management is increasingly being implemented through collaborative arrangements. Theoretically, collaborative arrangements draw together multiple stakeholders to achieve a holistic approach to management. However, there is no comprehensive underpinning theory to guide implementation. In response, the resource and environmental management literature has been dominated by the search for procedural theory. Encouraged by the history and experience the planning field has with decision-making in multi-stakeholder settings, planning theory - specifically communicative planning theory - has been encouraged as procedural theory for regional natural resource management. However, there has been limited empirical evaluation of this concept - particularly in natural resource management contexts. The aim of this research was to identify whether communicative planning theory represented an appropriate procedural theory to guide the implementation of regional natural resource management. This research addressed this aim through a comparison of the concepts and ideas comprising communicative planning theory with the forces shaping natural resource decisions and actions in practice within a collaborative approach to natural resource management. Qualitative research techniques were used to examine, in depth, a single case study of the implementation of the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality in the Condamine Catchment. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty-six stakeholders including mayors, farmers, members of non-government organisations, and representatives of State and Commonwealth agencies. The results of this research provide valuable understanding of how decisions are made and what role natural resource management objectives play within collaborative decisionmaking processes. This thesis builds theory relating to when, where, and if natural resource management objectives may be achieved through collaborative arrangements. Natural resource decisions and actions within the Condamine Catchment were shaped by three key forces. Firstly, the institutional arrangements that framed the collaborative approach influenced how organisational stakeholders would interact while undertaking natural resource management. Secondly, the structure of the decision-making processes influenced how decisions were produced. Finally, the characteristics (personalities, interests, agendas, and experience) of individual participants influenced the shape natural of resource decisions. Collectively, these forces discouraged the development of an integrated approach to natural resource management. Under the influence of these three forces natural resource management objectives played a secondary role to political manoeuvring within decisionmaking processes in the Condamine Catchment. Stakeholder agendas, motivations and interests became the primary concern as stakeholders implementing the National Action Plan became focused on controlling decisionmaking processes, instead of focusing on implementing natural resource management itself. Stakeholder relations were characterised by conflict as stakeholders competed for control of the decision-making processes. Communicative planning theory does not adequately identify or contend with the complex contextual forces shaping natural resource decisions within the Condamine Catchment. Nor does this concept offer clear direction on how to overcome the identified barriers to the development of an integrated approach to management. These research findings suggest that communicative planning theory does not represent an appropriate procedural theory to guide the implementation of regional natural resource management. Collaborative models of implementation are currently gaining dominance as the preferred delivery vehicle of regional natural resource management. This research implies that instead of searching for a meta-theory to guide implementation, the resource and environmental management field may be better served by developing a theoretical framework that makes practitioners aware of, and provides the tools to address, the context sensitive barriers that exist towards implementing natural resource management within multistakeholder settings. This research contributes towards the development of this understanding, and the tools necessary to unlock collaborative planning practice in individual settings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communicative</field><field name="subject">Planning</field><field name="subject">Theory</field><field name="subject">Integrated</field><field name="subject">Resource</field><field name="subject">Environmental</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Regional</field><field name="subject">Natural</field><field name="subject">Stakeholders</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071127.142417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representing Scientific Knowledge in High School Textbooks: a Corpus Study</field><field name="creator">Muspratt, Alexander Walter</field><field name="description">This thesis reports a computational corpus study of textbooks used in high school science programs in Queensland, Australia. The central research issues concern: 1. how textbook authors deploy linguistic resources in representing scientific knowledge; 2. whether or not authors deploy linguistic resources differently across the disciplines of science, and for younger and older readers; and, 3. whether or not variation in the deployment of linguistic resources can be interpreted in terms of the processes and mechanisms for establishing reliable and valid scientific knowledge. The thesis first summarises theoretical debates concerning the nature and teaching of science. An extended discussion, in the form of a case study of Galileo's work on motion, is presented, along with examples of how the 'Galileo story' has been revised and modified into popular and professional / educational imagination. This discussion thaws out critical points about the relationships between science as an observational and empirical activity and science as an abstract and intellectual activity. This is contrasted with educational constructivist accounts of learning and pedagogy, and how constructivist pedagogy is influenced by constructivist accounts of the doing of science. The data collection and analysis methods are then described in detail. A variety of tagging and marking techniques relating to vocabulary, logical formation and connection words, and grammatical formations are used. These provide the bases for a variety of frequency and collocational analyses, which, in turn, feed into a series of multivariate analyses. After presenting a descriptive overview of the corpus of textbooks, the results are reported in four chapters. Each chapter considers one linguistic resource in turn: vocabulary diversity, lexical organisation, words used to establish logical and structural formations, and grammatical organisation. These chapters show that there is systematic variation in authors deployment of linguistic resources, and that variation with respect to one linguistic resource is associated with variation with respect to the others. In particular, when scientific knowledge is presented through elaboration, persuasion, and description, there is little or no underlying structure to the phenomena being discussed, or there are few or no underlying concepts to which authors can return as their discussions progress. Alternatively, when scientific knowledge is presented in terms of rules, statements, procedures, and arrangements, the content of a topic is structured around a small number of underlying and uni~ing concepts. The contrast is between a loosely structured science that is descriptive, factual and observational, and a highly structured science that is for the most part theoretical. Furthermore, authors selectivity in their deployment of linguistic resources is associated with the major scientific disciplines. The suggestion is that the contents of Biology and Geology, with only a loose structure or no structure to the contents underlying concepts, are presented through elaboration, persuasion, and description, whereas the contents of Physics and Chemistry, structured around a small number of underlying and uni~ing concepts, are presented in terms of rules, statements, procedures, and arrangements. The thesis concludes that what is missing in textbook accounts that embody naive empiricism is the discernment evident in Galileos work: when, how and with what cost to 'simplify' the experiential world, and how to add back to theoretical accounts the complexities of the experiential world. It is an understanding of these processes and the ways in which they can be displayed and developed in classrooms that could better inform the preparation of science teachers as well as laying a stronger base for high school programs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School textbooks</field><field name="subject">science textbooks</field><field name="subject">scientific knowledge</field><field name="subject">teaching of science</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060913.150726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rainbows of Possibilities: Reading Difference in Catholic Women's Nomadic Feminist Theologizing</field><field name="creator">Musso, Anne Teresa</field><field name="description">In this thesis I analyze the presence of difference in the nomadic feminist theologizing of a group of eight Catholic women from an Australian diocese. This small christian community named Sophia-of which I am a member-has been meeting since October 1993 to support one another and share stories of our experiences as marginalized Catholics. In attempting to name and understand the various levels of rejection we had encountered, group members reflected on the performances of Catholic Church leaders, and we theologized on church leadership as well as other ecclesial and doctrinal issues. Participants readily agreed to be involved in the research project I was proposing, and they became interactive partners with me during the period that produced the theological discourses analyzed in the thesis. This production stage involved four phases: firstly, open or non-directed theologizing on issues raised by participants; secondly, a guided study-with myself as facilitator-of five traditional Matthean leadership texts; thirdly, a guided study of five Matthean women's leadership texts-again facilitated by me; and fourthly, a return to open or non-directed theologizing. My analysis of the group's theologizing focuses on d~'erence. Using Rosi Braidotti's work on embodied sexual difference which identifies three coexistent levels of difference, I explore and account for difference as it occurs: between women (Sophia) and men (the male representative voice of the institutional church); among women (in the seemingly homogeneous Sophian group); and within individual women (in Sophia). The analysis identifies signifiers of difference that signal Sophia ~s nomadic feminist renegotiations of dominant canonical Catholic discourses. Moreover, I account for the resisting readings mobilized by various Sophian members by exploring ideologies and key elements of interest-specifically power, conflict, desire, agency-that underpin Sophia 's theologizing. In doing this, difference, as evidenced in the multiple voices/perspectives that constitute the Catholic tradition and that feature in Sophia ~ theologizing, is valorized. The designing and de-signing of Sophia ~s nomadic feminist theological discourses in this thesis demonstrates that Sophia 's theological 'acts of going' intensified difference and engendered for participants multiple, transformative pathways and kaleidoscopic rainbows of ever so beautiful theological possibilities.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic women</field><field name="subject">church leadership</field><field name="subject">Catholic discourses</field><field name="subject">Catholic tradition</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050831.135351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Context, Complexity and Contestation in Curriculum Construction: Developing Social Studies in the New Zealand Curriculum</field><field name="creator">Mutch, Carol Anne</field><field name="description">In the 1990s, New Zealand's curriculum for the compulsory schooling sector was to undergo complete revision following the administrative reforms of the 1980s. The development of each new curriculum document followed a business model in which the Ministry of Education put the development process out for competitive tender. The successful bidders were to complete their tasks to strict Ministry guidelines and under the scrutiny of the Ministry's Curriculum Review Committee and the Minister's Policy Advisory Group. After the completion of a draft version, public consultation and school trials, a final curriculum document would be prepared and mandated as the legal curriculum requirements for New Zealand government-funded schools. The process that the fifth document, Social Studies in the New Zealand Curriculum, was to undergo proved to be elongated and controversial. As such, it provides a case study through which to examine, critique and theorise the nature of curriculum construction at a macro-level, in this case, at a national level. This study of the development of Social Studies in the New Zealand Curriculum illuminates three broad themes in curriculum construction - context, complexity and contestation. These themes arise from the literature and are reinforced by the study's findings. The study set out to: provide detailed description and analysis of an example of curriculum construction; use the selected case study to demonstrate the importance of the broader contexts within which curriculum construction occurs; problematise the notion of curriculum construction by highlighting the complexities in and around the process; articulate the contested nature of selecting and presenting curriculum contents; and provide insights into the personal and affective side of involvement in a macrolevel curriculum construction process. There are three main sources of data - the process itself, the products (three versions of Social Studies in the New Zealand Curriculum) and the people involved. A range of data gathering methods is used from primarily historical and ethnographic research within a qualitative framework. The main data gathering tools are archival research, document analysis and open-ended interviewing. As the data are mainly textual--either as original documents or created texts, as in interview transcripts-analytic strategies include content, thematic, semiotic and discourse analysis. Social constructionism (Burr, 1995) provides a unifying theoretical approach to frame the research design and analysis. In this dissertation, the background to the study, the findings and the discussion are interwoven and presented through three story strands - institutional, contextual and personal. The institutional strand aims to tell "what happened". The contextual strand aims to explain "why things happened as they did", "in what circumstances" and "why this might be important". The personal strand aims to give more prominence to the role of individuals in such a process, that is, "who was involved, how did individuals impact upon curriculum construction and how did the process impact upon them?" The layout of the dissertation also highlights the interwoven and complex nature of the ideas being explored. It is necessary to push the boundaries of a more traditional format to keep the notions of complexity and contestation to the fore. This manifests itself in the way that the chapter headings are based around the three story strands, the literature is integrated throughout the study and multi-layered stories and multiple interpretations are given. Within this framework, the usual features of a conventional research report - background, context, literature, theoretical underpinnings, methodological choices, findings and discussion - are still to be found but some liberty is taken to "open up the complications that [would] have been smoothed over" (Stronach &amp; MacLure, 1997, p. 5) in more traditional dissertations. The findings are analysed and presented in a variety of ways - as a chronology and a set of critical incidents to outline the process, as textual and visual analysis to examine the products, and through personal stories to illuminate the experiences of the people involved. Theorising from the data is problematised by using a range of theoretical explanations before proffering a synthesised model of curriculum construction as a multidimensional process. The findings from this study form two clusters - those that relate to the specific case study (the development of Social Studies in the New Zealand Curriculum) and those that provide deeper understanding of the broader nature of curriculum construction. The two sets of findings also demonstrate the interrelated nature of the three data sources - the process, the products and the people. In relation to the specific case study, there is clear evidence of the acceptance of social studies as a curriculum area in New Zealand with its own identity and integrity. The study also documents the historical development of social studies as a curriculum area and provides a detailed account of the contested nature of the development of the current social studies curriculum statement Social Studies in the New Zealand Curriculum. The other finding, relating specifically to the New Zealand context but which should give heart to practitioners everywhere, is the resilience of committed educators when faced with opposing ideological forces determined to undermine their position. This is exemplified in this case study by the social studies community's ability to reclaim control over the contents of the curriculum despite strong opposition from the Business Roundtable and other neo-liberal and neo-conservative forces. What is also revealed is that in order to achieve an acceptable outcome, a curriculum construction process needs both consultation and critique. Social Studies in the New Zealand Curriculum is all the stronger as a product because of the depth of the surrounding debate and this, in turn, strengthened the credibility of both the curriculum area and its supporters. The findings that relate to broader notions of curriculum construction either confirm key themes from the literature, expand upon some that are less explicit or offer new insights. The three touchstones of this study - context, complexity and contestation - were constantly reinforced through the gathering and analysis of the data, and confirmed by the findings. That curriculum construction is subject to a range of contextual factors - historical, social, cultural, political, economic and/or educational; that the process is complex and multi-layered; that the process is highly political and contested; and that the process and products are influenced by powerful individuals and groups both inside and outside the process, are all strongly confirmed by, and even consolidated in, this study. Notions alluded to in the literature that find stronger expression in this study relate to the nature of contestation throughout the process of curriculum construction. A model using Bourdieu's notions of field, capital and habitus (after Bourdieu and Passeron, 1977) allows stronger articulation of features such as polarisation, factionalisation, the forging of alliances and the fluid status of participants. The data reveal the curriculum construction process in a constant state of flux and subject to much serendipity. The findings also strengthen the notion that the products of a curriculum construction process are not ends in themselves but reveal much about the nature of the contestation and, indeed, lay the groundwork for future contested interpretations. New insights that arise from this study include an articulation of the strategies, such as compromise, contingency and expediency, that participants use to achieve their ends. These are often at the expense of participants' underpinning principles or adherence to particular curriculum development models. Significant insights come from the in-depth investigation of the emotional side of curriculum construction. The data reveal that the struggle for control over curriculum contents is an emotionally-charged process; that participants in the process wrestle with the differences between their own personal platforms, their ideological influences, the groups they represent and the requirements of the task; that contestation occurs between those setting and those completing the task, especially in relationship to professional decision-making and intellectual ownership; and that no consideration is given to the emotional cost of involvement in such large-scale curriculum construction processes. In summary, context shapes the unique nature of curriculum construction processes and products. If an understanding of these factors is tempered with an awareness of the complex and multi-dimensional nature of curriculum construction this will strengthen the process and could lessen the negative effects of ideologically-motivated or emotionally-charged involvement in the process. Finally, as contestation in curriculum construction is unavoidable in such high-stakes processes, consultation and critique should be seen as opportunities (rather than threats), to enhance the credibility of the final product.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">curriculum development</field><field name="subject">curriculum construction</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">school</field><field name="subject">schools</field><field name="subject">social studies</field><field name="subject">contestation</field><field name="subject">Pierre Bourdieu</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040514.104836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Extending BDI Logics</field><field name="creator">Nair, Vineet</field><field name="description">In this thesis we extend BDI logics, which are normal multimodal logics with an arbitrary set of normal modal operators, from three different perspectives. Firstly, based on some recent developments in modal logic, we examine BDI logics from a combining logic perspective and apply combination techniques like fibring/dovetailing for explaining them. The second perspective is to extend the underlying logics so as to include action constructs in an explicit way based on some recent action-related theories. The third perspective is to adopt a non-monotonic logic like defeasible logic to reason about intentions in BDI. As such, the research captured in this thesis is theoretical in nature and situated at the crossroads of various disciplines relevant to Artificial Intelligence (AI). More specifically this thesis makes the following contributions: 1. Combining BDI Logics through fibring/dovetailing: BDI systems modeling rational agents have a combined system of logics of belief, time and intention which in turn are basically combinations of well understood modal logics. The idea behind combining logics is to develop general techniques that allow to produce combinations of existing and well understood logics. To this end we adopt Gabbay's fibring/dovetailing technique to provide a general framework for the combinations of BDI logics. We show that the existing BDI framework is a dovetailed system. Further we give conditions on the fibring function to accommodate interaction axioms of the type G [superscript k,l,m,n] ([diamond][superscript k] &#129;[superscript l] [phi]&#129; [implies] &#129;[superscript m] [diamond][superscript n] [phi]) based on Catach's multimodal semantics. This is a major result when compared with other combining techniques like fusion which fails to accommodate axioms of the above type. 2. Extending the BDI framework to accommodate Composite Actions: Taking motivation from a recent work on BDI theory, we incorporate the notion of composite actions, [pi]-1; [pi]-2 (interpreted as [pi]-1 followed by [pi]-2), to the existing BDI framework. To this end we introduce two new constructs Result and Opportunity which helps in reasoning about the actual execution of such actions. We give a set of axioms that can accommodate the new constructs and analyse the set of commitment axioms as given in the original work in the background of the new framework. 3. Intention reasoning as Defeasible reasoning: We argue for a non-monotonic logic of intention in BDI as opposed to the usual normal modal logic one. Our argument is based on Bratman's policy-based intention. We show that policy-based intention has a defeasible/non-monotonic nature and hence the traditional normal modal logic approach to reason about such intentions fails. We give a formalisation of policy-based intention in the background of defeasible logic. The problem of logical omniscience which usually accompanies normal modal logics is avoided to a great extend through such an approach.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BDI</field><field name="subject">BDI Logics</field><field name="subject">belief-desire-intention</field><field name="subject">combining logics</field><field name="subject">defeasible logic</field><field name="subject">fibring</field><field name="subject">dovetailing</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">modal logic</field><field name="subject">modality</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030929.095254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade Liberalisation and Poverty in a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Model: The Sri Lankan Case</field><field name="creator">Naranpanawa, Athula Kithsiri Bandara</field><field name="description">Many trade and development economists, policy makers and policy analysts around the world believe that globalisation promotes growth and reduces poverty. There exists a large body of theoretical and empirical literature on how trade liberalisation helps to promote growth and reduce poverty. However, critics of globalisation argue that, in developing countries, integration into the world economy makes the poor poorer and the rich richer. The most common criticism of globalisation is that it increases poverty and inequality. Much of the research related to the link between openness, growth and poverty has been based on cross-country regressions. Dollar and Kraay (2000; 2001), using regression analysis, argue that growth is pro poor. Moreover, their study suggests that growth does not affect distribution and poor as well as rich could benefit from it. Later, they demonstrate that openness to international trade stimulates rapid growth, thus linking trade liberalisation with improvements in wellbeing of the poor. Several other cross-country studies demonstrate a positive relationship between trade openness and economic growth (see for example Dollar, 1992; Sach and Warner, 1995 and Edward, 1998). In contrast, Rodriguez and Rodrik (2001) question the measurements related to trade openness in economic models, and suggest that generalisations cannot be made regarding the relationship between trade openness and growth. Several other studies also criticise the pro poor growth argument based upon the claim of weak econometrics and place more focus on the distributional aspect (see, for example, Rodrik, 2000). Ultimately, openness and growth have therefore become an empirical matter, and so has the relationship between trade and poverty. These weaknesses of cross-country studies have led to a need to provide evidence from case studies. Systematic case studies related to individual countries will at least complement cross-country studies such as that of Dollar and Kraay. As Chen and Ravallion (2004, p.30) argue, 'aggregate inequality or poverty may not change with trade reform even though there are gainers and losers at all levels of living'. They further argue that policy analysis which simply averages across diversities may miss important matters that are critical to the policy debate. In this study, Sri Lanka is used as a case study and a computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach is adopted as an analytical framework. Sri Lanka was selected as an interesting case in point to investigate this linkage for the following reasons: although Sri Lanka was the first country in the South Asian region to liberalise its trade substantially in the late seventies, it still experiences an incidence of poverty of a sizeable proportion that cannot be totally attributed to the long-standing civil conflict. Moreover, trade poverty linkage within the Sri Lankan context has hardly received any attention, while multi-sectoral general equilibrium poverty analysis within the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) based CGE model has never been attempted. In order to examine the link between globalisation and poverty, a poverty focussed CGE model for the Sri Lankan economy has been developed in this study. As a requirement for the development of such a model, a SAM of the Sri Lankan economy for the year 1995 has been constructed. Moreover, in order to estimate the intra group income distribution in addition to the inter group income distribution, income distribution functional forms for different household groups have been empirically estimated and linked to the CGE model in 'top down' mode: this will compute a wide range of household level poverty and inequality measurements. This is a significant departure from the traditional representative agent hypothesis used to specifying household income distributions. Furthermore, as the general equilibrium framework permits endogenised prices, an attempt was made to endogenise the change in money metric poverty line within the CGE model. Finally, a set of simulation experiments was conducted to identify the impacts of trade liberalisation in manufacturing and agricultural industries on absolute and relative poverty at household level. The results show that, in the short run, trade liberalisation of manufacturing industries increases economic growth and reduces absolute poverty in low-income household groups. However, it is observed that the potential benefits accruing to the rural low-income group are relatively low compared to other two low-income groups. Reduction in the flow of government transfers to households following the loss of tariff revenue may be blamed for this trend. In contrast, long run results indicate that trade liberalisation reduces absolute poverty in substantial proportion in all groups. It further reveals that, in the long run, liberalisation of the manufacturing industries is more pro poor than that of the agricultural industries. Overall simulation results suggest that trade reforms may widen the income gap between the rich and the poor, thus promoting relative poverty. This may warrant active interventions with respect to poverty alleviation activities following trade policy reforms.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trade liberalisation</field><field name="subject">computable general equilibrium</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">Sri Lankan economy</field><field name="subject">trade (Sri Lanka)</field><field name="subject">trade poverty linkage</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070130.165943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making Fun: Work and Organisational Practices in Australian Aquatic Theme Parks</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Silvia Azevedo</field><field name="description">The Australian aquatic theme park segment is a vibrant and significant part of the Australian tourism industry because as a tourism generator it is a direct contributor to the economy and to employment growth. Research in this area can provide a deeper understanding of the complexities of the industry and its future effectiveness.  Tourism organisations, such as aquatic theme parks, need to rely on the commitment and performance of a well-trained, multi-skilled workforce in order to achieve a competitive position, especially in terms of providing high quality customer service. This suggests that tourism organisations need to adopt effective organisational practices that enhance the motivation of employees and improve organisational effectiveness by providing the level of quality customer service required to become and remains competitive.  Although the tourism industry in general and the theme park segment in particular make an important contribution to the Australia economy, minimal research has been undertaken to determine the factors that contribute to the effectiveness of organisational practices that influence work-related outcomes (commitment, job satisfaction and employee performance). As a related issue, no research has been undertaken to examine the perception of professionalism of employees undertaking marine science activities within Australian aquatic theme parks. Accordingly, one of the objectives of the present research was to examine the impact of organisational practices (training and communication) on affective commitment, job satisfaction and employee performance within the Australian aquatic theme park segment. The second objective was to examine whether the impact of such organisational practices on these work-related outcomes varies between employees designated to undertake marine science related activities and other theme park employees (salespersons, food and beverage and administrative). The final objective of this research was to examine whether employees designated to undertake marine science related activities perceive themselves as professionals.  The Meaning of Working Theoretical Framework (based on the Meaning of Working (MOW) model developed by Westwood and Lok, 2003) is used in this research as a conceptual framework to enable a better understanding of the meanings and significance that aquatic theme park employees attach to their work roles.  Understanding the basic meanings that individuals attach to their work roles provides relevant insights into the nature of employee commitment, job satisfaction and employee performance, given the apparent impact of perceived work significance on employee attitudes and behaviours. Application of the Meaning of Working Theoretical Framework therefore broadened the conceptual framework of the present research to include and clarify the central constructs of commitment, job satisfaction and employee performance in Australian aquatic theme park workplaces.  The present study was undertaken with employees from three Australian aquatic theme park companies, including 'marine science employees' and 'other theme park employees', with a particular emphasis on the former group of employees. The nature of the current study suggested the value of using both quantitative and qualitative methods (mixed methods methodology) and so, the adoption of the pragmatist paradigm was appropriate in framing and answering the thesis&#146; research questions. Quantitative and qualitative methods in this study were conceptualized, designed and implemented sequentially. Quantitative methods (e.g. survey) were conducted first in order to develop a level of generalisation that not only added knowledge to the theory but also enabled a prediction in understanding levels of commitment, job satisfaction and employee performance. Qualitative methods (indepth interviews and focus group discussions) then provided in-depth information and insights into the link between organisational practices (e.g. training and communication) and work-related outcomes and perceptions of professionalism for marine science employees.  The findings of this study have broadened the scope of the MOW model developed by Westwood and Lok (2003) in a number of significant and original ways. In particular, consideration of the relationship between employees and customers and analysis of the values maintained by the organisational culture and their influence on the particular subcultures within the organisations studied proved to be essential in understanding the work meanings patterns in this study. The present study further developed the MOW model by clearly demonstrating the critical role played by training and communication in influencing patterns of work meanings. In addition, this study also expanded the Westwood and Lok&#146;s (2003) MOW model by including issues related to professionalism. The findings of the present study highlighted the pivotal role played by a key HRM practice (on-the-job training), which is more relevant in influencing work-related outcomes than the impact of communication processes, as demonstrated in the study data and analysis. Contrary to expectations, the findings suggested that communication processes play an indirect role in influencing organisational effectiveness, in terms of providing high quality service because of an identified &#145;gap&#146; in beliefs and behaviours regarding customer service. Both training and communication processes appeared to be relatively ineffective in reducing this ambiguity regarding customer service for both group of employees within the aquatic theme parks studied. This should lead to a re-thinking of both training and communication practices to enhance the focus on, and delivery of quality customer service. A number of suggestions are canvassed. Another major finding of this thesis indicates that marine science employees not only perceive themselves as professionals but their status (job/occupation) within the tourism community supports a perception of emerging professionalism.  The results revealed in the present study have the potential to impact positively on the tourism industry in general and on the aquatic theme park segment in particular. However, it is clear from the present research that the vibrancy of the tourism industry and the aquatic theme park segment can only be enhanced with more attention to communication and training, with an emphasis on improving employee self-efficacy, especially in the area of customer service.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquatic Theme Parks</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Work and Organisational Practices</field><field name="subject">tourism industry</field><field name="subject">Tourism organisations</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070823.153208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High Pressure Synthesis of Conducting Polymers</field><field name="creator">Neuendorf, Annette J</field><field name="description">An experimental investigation of the high pressure synthesis of water soluble, self doping conducting polymers is presented.  2- And 3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid and the respective sodium sulfonates have been polymerised. Optimal polymerisation conditions have been determined with respect to yield, conductivity and molecular weight. Reaction parameters such as oxidant, pressure, catalysts, reaction time and temperature and the use of additives were investigated. The minimum pressure required for polymerisation was 7 kbar. An increase in pressure had a negligible effect on polymer characteristics. The polymers were generated in aqueous, non-acidic media, to ensure they were selfdoping when characterised. Conductivities of between 10-6 Scm-1 and 10-3 Scm-1 were measured. The sulfonate salts reacted faster than the sulfonic acids and for both a longer reaction time resulted in higher yields and conductivities. These polymers were completely water soluble, of high molecular weight and able to be cast as thin films. The arylamines 5- and 8-aminonaphthalene-2-sulfonic acid and their respective sodium sulfonates were polymerised at elevated pressure. The naphthalene sulfonate salts polymerised at atmospheric pressure, but displayed a higher molecular weight when reacted under pressure. Generally the naphthalene monomers reacted similarly to the benzene monomers, although there were some differences. Conductivity and yield decreased with increased reaction times and the use of 0.1M equivalents of ferrous sulfate had an negligible effect on the polymers. The polynaphthalenes were highly water soluble, self doping and had conductivities in the order 10-5 to 10-3 Scm-1. A measurement of the activation volume for the polymerisation of 2-methoxyaniline and sodium 8-aminonaphthalene-2-sulfonate was performed.

To gain insight into how Jamaican principals conceptualise and experience leadership the study adopted a qualitative, collective case-study design. A purposeful sampling strategy was used to select four exemplary high school principals such that gender, school location and organization were varied. Data were sourced from semi-structured interviews, non-participant observation sessions and integrative diagrams as well as from school, principal and official Ministry of Education, Youth and Culture documents. Within-case and cross-case analyses were conducted using grounded theory modes of analysis, specifically the systematic processes referred to as open and axial coding.  Findings from the within-case analysis are presented as four individual cases that communicate the salient features of each principal's leadership and context. In the first case entitled Mother of the Poor, the principal defines school leadership as the pursuit of excellence within a framework of valuing and caring for students. The principal at the centre of the second case, The Reculturing Principal, portrays leadership as transforming school culture so that it is receptive to change and committed to growth and improvement. The principal featured in the third case understands leadership as a response to students' social problems, diminished self-concept and dysfunctional community relationships - hence the title The Principal as Social Architect. The final case presents The Community Principal who conceptualizes leadership in terms of building caring, co-operative relationships among all involved in the schooling process with a view to developing community connectedness.  Findings from the cross-case analysis are presented as two broad themes that characterize the principals' conceptualization and interpretation of school leadership. The first theme - 'Leadership as values-driven' - identified care and respect, social justice and excellence as the common values that defined the principals' leadership, permeating their interactions and informing their decisions. The second theme  - 'Leadership as responding to and acting on context' - revealed that dynamics related to personal, school-community and policy contexts also entered into and interacted with their understandings of leadership. While all four principals in this study were guided and informed by common values, they applied them to their leadership in individual ways, modifying their approaches and emphases in response to a range of contextual elements that were both dynamic and unique. Generally, the principals conceptualized leadership as a moral undertaking, and values together with context emerged as powerful influences on how they defined, interpreted and enacted school leadership.  Findings from this study contribute to local knowledge about principals and school leadership. Currently, perspectives on what constitutes school leadership depend on frameworks developed for other environments even though the extent to which these are applicable to a Caribbean context is unknown. Furthermore, in the context of recent shifts in policy, it is important to understand what and how principals think about leadership. In this respect, the findings may serve as a guide for future decisions about leadership training and professional development for principals and aspiring principals.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational leadership</field><field name="subject">school leadership</field><field name="subject">leaders</field><field name="subject">high school</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">principals</field><field name="subject">Jamaica</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040910.144727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Search of the 'Golden Thread': Common Law Interactions With Indigenous Law in Canada, Australia and New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ng, Mei Lin</field><field name="description">The thesis explores the interactions of the common law with indigenous law in three jurisdictions: Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  Case law involving family, criminal and land law is examined in detail, to establish how the common law has interacted with indigenous law.  Two aspects of common law interactions are explored: judicial approaches to the recognition of indigenous law; and, judicial perceptions about the relationship between the common law and indigenous law. Courts faced with indigenous law have taken one of three approaches to recognising it.  These are respectively referred to in the thesis as the non-recognition approach, the accommodation approach and the recognition approach.  With regard to judicial perceptions about the relationship between the common law and indigenous law, the case law reveals seven different perceptions.  They are: no relationship; mere acknowledgement; separate but capable of recognition; adjustment; assimilation/domination; assimilation/search for partnership; and absorption. Where a relationship is acknowledged, although perceptions may vary, essentially they can be placed in one of three categories.  Courts may regard the relationship as one between two separate bodies of law, with points of intersection.  They may regard it as one of convergence, perhaps even partial integration, between separate legal traditions.  Finally, they may regard indigenous law as having been absorbed into the dominant legal system.  Courts with this latter perception regard indigenous law as analogous to English local customs. Having identified more than one approach to the recognition of indigenous law, consideration is given to the circumstances in which the approaches are used, exploring differences arising out of the subject area in question and the jurisdiction in which the case is considered. The thesis also demonstrates that some correlation exists between the judicial approach to recognition of indigenous law and judicial perceptions about the relationship of the common law with indigenous law, though this correlation cannot be demonstrated in all cases.  Lastly, the capacity of the common law to recognise changes to indigenous law is considered, where the case law reveals that both the judicial approach to recognition of indigenous law, and judicial perceptions about the relationship between the common law and indigenous law have a bearing on the capacity of the courts to recognise change.  The thesis demonstrates that both the judicial approach to recognition of indigenous law and judicial perceptions about the relationship between the common law and indigenous law affect common law interactions with indigenous law.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Common law</field><field name="subject">indigenous law</field><field name="subject">Canada</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070314.163150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hollywood 2.0: Digital Audio-Visual Production as a Rhizomic Process</field><field name="creator">Nicholas, Joshua</field><field name="description">This exegesis explores the notions of production process paradigm shift through the analysis of digital technologies and their effect on the production of 'CruelUnusual'.

Eschewing the orthodox sub-cultural approach which situates 'punk' within a structuralist hegemony / resistance paradigm, the thesis uses participant observation and textual analysis techniques to understand the role played by zines (hand made publications) in fostering the intellectual and ethical capacities needed to participate in the Australian DIY anarcha-punk scene. The zines, in their deviation from classical anarchism, often invoke concepts of power and 'the political' analogous with those of poststructuralist theory, yet DIY anarchist politics also diverge from poststructuralism.  I therefore address DIY anarchist politics by questioning the significance of these inconsistencies with Theory.  In doing so I am led to suggest that the zines may be more usefully approached as elements in the ethico-political practice of DIY anarchism, which nonetheless draws on the 'conceptual vocabulary' of much poststructuralism, as well as other theoretical approaches. Thus I re-describe DIY anarchism as an ethos which seeks to argue for its agendas and values on non-foundational terms.  Further, I demonstrate that by pursuing an ethos of 'autonomy', the culture's participants seek to develop their intellectual and ethical capacities through a self-consciously 'developmental' engagement of power relationships, in the form of DIY 'prefiguration' or exemplification. Following the preoccupation with gender politics in the zines and the wider scenes, I describe the approach to gender politics in similarly ethico-political terms, drawing likewise on various elements of poststructuralist and other theories.  I show this feminist ethical practice to be based on assumptions about gender which embody a certain poststructuralist approach to 'gender', one that is predicated on the material effects of a discursively congealed gender structure, but forms part of an ethos aiming to deconstruct this structure. By re-describing the political approaches of these zines in reference to various theoretical perspectives and ethico-political practices, I am able to offer perspectives to the culture in question, as well as to the interdisciplinary academic context within which I am writing.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian anarcha-punk Zines</field><field name="subject">DIY anarchist</field><field name="subject">gender politics</field><field name="subject">punk</field><field name="subject">structuralist hegemony/resistance paradigm</field><field name="subject">poststructuralism</field><field name="subject">ethico-political practices</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070104.115215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in Coordination Chemistry</field><field name="creator">Noack, Cassandra</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis was carried out in Brisbane, Australia and Calgary, Canada. The aim of the research conducted in Brisbane was to prepare a series of copper(I) and ruthenium(II) based complexes incorporating a hemilabile phosphine ligand and to determine whether or not these compounds possessed catalytic activity.  The history, uses, properties and recent work incorporating hemilabile phosphine ligands is discussed in detail as well as the application of hemilabile ligands to atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and the usefulness of the 'windscreen wiper' action of these ligands in polymerization. The literature synthesis and characterization of four hemilabile phosphine ligands is reported with modifications. The (2-chlorophenyl)diphenylphosphine ligand was prepared via a Grignard reaction giving a 11% yield. The (2-bromophenyl) diphenylphosphine ligand was prepared by reaction of 2-bromoiodobenzene with Ph2PSiMe3 in the presence of a palladium catalyst (MeCN)2PdCl2 which yielded 50% product. The 1-chloro-2-diphenylphosphinoethane ligand was prepared following the generation of a lithium diphenylphosphide which was added to 1,2-dichloroethane to give a 43% yield of product. The (2-benzoic-acid)diphenylphosphine ligand was prepared by hydrolysis of (2-methyl-ester-phenyl)diphenylphosphine. Following acidification of the methyl ester phosphine with HCl, the desired product was isolated in 88% yield.  The synthesis and characterization of a series of copper(I) based complexes incorporating the prepared phosphine ligands involved reaction in CH3CN of the appropriate ligand with copper halides as starting material. Solution state 31P NMR and mass spectrometry were used to study many of these complexes in the solution state, whilst microanalysis, 31P CP MAS NMR and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies were used to study their solid state properties. The complexes of the type bis(2-halophenyl)diphenylphosphine copper halide were found to be three coordinate with non-chelating ligands and to be isostructural with the previously studied bis(2-methylphenyl)diphenylphosphine copper halide complexes. The synthesis and characterization of ruthenium(II) based complexes incorporating hemilabile phosphine ligands involved reaction of the appropriate ligands in MeOH with RuCl3.3H2O or RuCl2(DMSO)4 as the ruthenium source. Modes of characterization included solution state 31P NMR, mass spectrometry, microanalysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. All ruthenium(II) based complexes were found to incorporate the hemilabile ligands in a chelating mode resulting in 6 coordinate structures. The preliminary polymerization testing of MMA in the presence of the copper(I) and ruthenium(II) based complexes has been reported. All complexes successfully polymerized the monomer and the resulting polyMMA showed polydispersity values ranging from moderate (3.1) to very high (6.7).  Chapter 7 discusses research conducted over a 6 month period at the University of Calgary, Canada under an International Resident Fellowship award. This work involved the synthesis and characterization of scandium(III) and yttrium(III) based complexes incorporating a chelating amido-imine ligand, as potential olefin polymerization catalysts.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hemilabile phosphine ligands</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">copper-based complexes</field><field name="subject">ruthenium</field><field name="subject">ruthenium-based complexes</field><field name="subject">atom transfer radical polymerization</field><field name="subject">ATRP</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031030.145610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship Between School-Based Management, Student Outcomes and School Performance</field><field name="creator">Nobbs, Cameron John Stuart</field><field name="description">This study focused on the relationship between school-based management, student outcomes and school performance. Its purpose was to identify the conditions that exist in self-managed schools which facilitate improved student outcomes and school performance. In particular, the study investigated three questions: 1. what are the enabling conditions in schools employing school-based management which school staff and parents consider influential in the achievement of improved student outcomes? 2. what explanations do these people give for how these conditions are applied within their schools to achieve success? 3.	what judgents do school staff and parents make about the relationship between school-based management, student outcomes and overall school performance? The dissertation commences by describing major challenges and issues facing education over the next decade and by discussing how international and Australian systems of education are responding to these challenges through the implementation of various models of school-based management A review of international literature covering the last fifteen years is then presented to show that the promises and potentials of school-based management espoused by educational authorities have not necessarily led to an automatic improvement in student outcomes and school performance. Various conditions that may enable a school to implement school-based management effectively are suggested.. These conditions, derived from the literature review, are used as the initial prompts to undertake research in fOur Queensland primary schools Qualitative methodologies are used to gather data related to the three questions of the study in these four schools. The data obtained from the fouw case studies are then presented and discussed. The research findings suggest that the relationship between school-based management, student outcomes and school performance are dependent on the existence of severa1 conditions within school-based managed schools. These involve: 1. a comprehensive understanding of the powers available within a school-based management regime; 2. a school's organisational readiness to take on school-based management responsibilities and authonties; 3.	the existence of six bases and their enabling conditions: i. an Ideology Base; ii	a Relationship Base; iii. a Performance Base; iv. a Pedagogy Base; v. a Management Base; vi. a Governance Base. 4. the capacity of the school to implement school-based management in terms of contextual issues such as the size of the school, workfbrce experience and competency, geographical location and complexity of the campus; 5. the requirement of the controlling authority to delegate key powers and resources such as staffing, facilities management and total school budgeting; 6. a school-based process to manage change and school improvement. It is argued that these conditions maximise the ability of those involved in school-based management to influence improvements in student outcomes and school performance. The dissertation concludes by suggesting five major implications of the study and at least three areas of possible filture research The five major implications are: 1. the development of clear understandings of the scope of the authorities and responsibilities available to school-based managed schools in Queensland; 2. the need to develop methodology to evaluate and identify school organisational readiness to take on school-based management; 3. the development and implementation of a process that will enhance school effectiveness; 4. the development and implementation of a process that can enhance the quality of governance within Education Queensland schools; 5. the development of differentiated school-based management options that broaden the decentralised authorities to schools in consideration of their organisational readiness and capacity to implement school-based management. There are at least three areas of possible future research. The first of these areas involves research to investigate the conditions that exist within schools (to which Education Queensland has assigned the most advanced devolution of authority) that are not successful in improving student outcomes and school performance.. The second area of further research involves an evaluation of the effect that the current school council governance model has on the improvement of student outcomes and school performance.. The third area of future research involves the investigation of the possibilities of enhancing existing school-based management responsibilities and authorities in Education Queensland schools. In summary, this study suggests that school-based management has been used by educational authorities in Australia and overseas as a possible means to improve student outcomes and school performance. The fmdings suggest that for school-based management to achieve what it was set out to achieve, schools need to work an a number of enabling conditions. The most important of these include: an understanding of the school's core purpos~, a school-wide commitment to high teaching expectations, an understanding of the roles and responsibilities of staff, a principal who has a strong commitment to students, a principal who has high hopes, aspirations and expectations for the school, a strong fOcus on literacy, especially reading, effective behaviour management programmes, systems that identify and target student's needs, highly professional staff and school staffing that responds to the complexity of the school. These fmdings are consistent with the argument that there is no automatic causal link between the implementation of school-based management and improved student outcomes and school performance.. It is only when particular enabling conditions exist or are developing within a school, that effective school-based management can take root and support a range of school-based initiatives focused on the improvement of student and school performance When this is the case, school-based management may influence a school's ability to improve student outcomes and school performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School-based management</field><field name="subject">self-managed schools</field><field name="subject">student outcomes</field><field name="subject">school performance</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060914.145845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The More Things Change ...: Continuity in Australian Indigenous Employment Disadvantage 1788 - 1967</field><field name="creator">Norris, Rae</field><field name="description">The extent of Australian Indigenous employment disadvantage has been quantitatively established by researchers since the 1970s. Indigenous Australians have higher unemployment and lower participation rates, they are occupationally concentrated in low skill, low paid jobs, and their income is significantly lower on average than that of other Australians. The explanations given for this disadvantage largely focus on skills deficit and geographical location of Indigenous people. However these explanations do not stand up to scrutiny. Indigenous employment disadvantage remains irrespective of where Indigenous Australians live or how well they are qualified. Alternative explanations are clearly needed. A clue to the direction of research is given by the same researchers who acknowledge the legacy of history in creating the situation of disadvantage faced by Indigenous Australians. However, to date the nature of this legacy has not been explored. It is this history which is the focus of this thesis. The research questions which the thesis addresses are: 1. Are there identifiable 'invariant elements' which underpin the institutional forms which have regulated the treatment of Indigenous Australians within the economy, particularly in relation to employment, from colonisation until recent times? 2. Do these invariant elements help explain the continuing employment disadvantage of Indigenous Australians? To examine the history of the treatment of Indigenous Australians in relation to employment, four concepts were developed from the regulation school of economic theory and the work of Appadurai. These concepts are econoscape, reguloscape, invariant elements and institutional forms. The notion of 'scape' allows for recognition that when Australia was colonised, there already existed a set of economic arrangements and social and legal system. The conflict between the introduced economy and legal and social systems can be conceived as a conflict between two econoscapes and reguloscapes. Analysis of the econoscape and reguloscape from international, national and Indigenous perspectives for the period from colonisation to 1850 has enabled the identification of 'invariant elements' which describe the ways of thinking about Aborigines brought to the Australian colonies and adapted to the realities of the Australian situation. The four invariant elements identified are summarised as belief in 1) Aboriginal inferiority; 2) Aboriginal laziness, incapacity and irresponsibility; 3) the need for white intervention in Aboriginal lives; and 4) disregard for Aboriginal understandings, values and choices. The fourth invariant element is conceptualised as the foundation on which basis the other three developed and were able to be perpetuated. Analysis of the laws pertaining to Aborigines promulgated between 1850 and the 1960s in four jurisdictions shows that the same invariant elements influenced the nature of the institutional forms used to limit the freedom of movement and of employment of Indigenous Australians. Although during the period from the 1850s to the 1960s there was ostensibly a change in policy from one of protection to one of assimilation of Indigenous Australians, in fact little changed in terms of perceptions of Aborigines or in the institutional forms which, by the 1920s in all jurisdictions surveyed, controlled every aspect of their lives. Confirmation of the influence of the invariant elements was sought through closer study of two particular cases from the beginning and end of the above time period. These case studies involved examination of the institutional forms within the context of the econoscape and reguloscape of different times, in the first case in Victoria in the 1860s-1880s, and in the second case in the Northern Territory in the 1960s. The analysis indicates that the invariant elements had a continuing influence on perceptions and treatment of Indigenous Australians at least to the referendum of 1967. This thesis establishes, through rigorous analysis based on a robust theoretical and methodological foundation, that identifiable ways of thinking, or invariant elements, have underpinned continuous Indigenous employment disadvantage and help explain this continuing disadvantage. The common explanations of Indigenous disadvantage are also consistent with these invariant elements. The thesis concludes by recommending further research based on the findings of this thesis be conducted to scrutinise policy and practice over the last three to four decades in relation to Indigenous employment. It also emphasises the importance of redefining the problem and finding solutions, tasks which can only be done effectively by Indigenous Australians.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian indigenous employment disadvantage</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">colonial Australia</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians employment</field><field name="subject">econoscape</field><field name="subject">reguloscape</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070109.161046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accord, Discord, Discourse and Dialogue in the Search for Sustainable Development: Labour-Environmentalist Cooperation and Conflict in Australian Debates on Ecologically Sustainable Development and Economic Restructuring in the Period of the Federal Labor Government, 1983-96</field><field name="creator">Norton, Paul C. R.</field><field name="description">The thesis seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics of interaction between the environmental and labour movements, and the conditions under which they can cooperate and form alliances in pursuit of a sustainable development agenda which simultaneously promotes ecological and social justice goals.  After developing an explanatory model of the labour-environmentalist relationship (LER) on the basis of a survey of theoretical and case-study literature, the thesis applies this model to three significant cases of labour-environmental interaction in Australia, each representing a different point on the spectrum from LER conflict to LER cooperation, during the period from 1983 to 1996. Commonly held views that there are inevitable tendencies to LER conflict, whether due to an irreconcilable "jobs versus environment" contradiction or due to the different class bases of the respective movements, are analysed and rejected.  A model of the LER implicit in Siegmann (1985) is interrogated against more recent LER studies from six countries, and reworked into a new model (the Siegmann-Norton model) which explains tendencies to conflict and cooperation in the LER in terms of the respective ideologies of labour and environmentalism, their organisational forms and cultures, the national political-institutional framework and the respective places of labour and environmentalism therein, the political economy of specific sectors and regions in which LER interaction occurs, and sui generis sociological and demographic characteristics of labour and environmental actors. The thesis then discusses the major changes in the ideologies, organisational forms and political-institutional roles of the Australian labour movement which occurred during the period of the study, and their likely influence on the LER.  The two processes of most importance in driving such changes were the corporatist Accord relationship between the trade union movement and Labor Party government from 1983 to 1996, and the strategic reorganisation of the trade union movement between 1988 and 1996 in response to challenges and opportunities in the wider political-economic environment. The research hypothesis is that the net effect of these changes would have been to foster tendencies towards LER conflict.  The hypothesis is tested in three significant case studies, namely: (a) the interaction, often conflictual, between the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the environmental movement in debates around macroeconomic policy, economic restructuring and sustainable development from the mid-1980s onwards; (b) the complex interaction, involving elements of cooperation, disagreement and dialogue, between the environmental movement and the unions representing coal mining and energy workers in the formulation of Australia's climate change policies; and (c) the environmental policy and campaign initiatives of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union to improve workplace environmental performance and promote worker environmental education. The case studies confirmed the research hypothesis in the sense that, whilst the LER tended overall towards greater cooperation in the period of the study, the Accord relationship and union restructuring process worked to slow the growth of cooperative tendencies and sustain conflict over particular issues beyond what might otherwise have been the case.  The Accord relationship served to maintain conflict tendencies due to the dominance of productivist ideologies within the ACTU, and the union movement's perseverance with this relationship after the vitiation of its progressive potential by neo-liberal trends in public policy.  The tripartite Accord processes institutionalised a "growth coalition" of labour, business and the state in opposition to excluded constituencies such as the environmental movement.  This was partially overcome during the period of the Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) process, which temporarily included the environmental movement as an insider in the political-institutional framework.  The long-run effects of union reorganisation on the LER are difficult to determine as the new organisational forms of unions were not in place until almost the end of the period of the study.  However, in the short term the disruptive effects of the amalgamations process restricted unions' capacity to engage with environmental issues. Pro-environment initiatives by the AMWU, and cooperative aspects of the coal industry unions' relationship with environmentalists, reflected the social unionist ideology and internal democratic practices of those unions, and the influence of the ESD Working Group process, whilst LER conflict over greenhouse reflected the adverse political economy of the coal industry, but also the relevant unions' less developed capacity for independent research and membership education compared to the AMWU.  The LER in all three cases can be satisfactorily explained, and important insights derived, through application of the Siegmann-Norton model.  Conclusions drawn include suggestions for further research and proposals for steps to be taken by labour and environmental actors to improve cooperation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">political</field><field name="subject">economic restructuring</field><field name="subject">ecologically sustainable development</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">accord</field><field name="subject">environmentalists</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">environmentalism</field><field name="subject">green politics</field><field name="subject">Labor</field><field name="subject">Robert James Lee Hawke</field><field name="subject">Bob Hawke</field><field name="subject">Paul Keating</field><field name="subject">unions</field><field name="subject">trade unions</field><field name="subject">union</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040924.093047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflection and Refraction: The Dimpled Mirror of Process Drama: How Process Drama Assists People to Reflect on Their Attitudes and Behaviours Associated with Mental Illness</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Peter J</field><field name="description">The National Project to Counter Stigma and Discrimination was established by the New Zealand government in 1997.  The Project recognised that people with a diagnosis of mental illness are marginalized and excluded from full participation in society.  The Mental Health Foundation was contracted to provide workshops for mental health service providers to shift workplace attitudes and behaviours that were discriminatory or stigmatising. This thesis used a case study approach to capture and evaluate the significance and nature of the transitory form of process drama in three workshops I facilitated in largely Maori communities in the far north of the North Island.  The principles of reflective practitioner research informed the use of research tools, data collection and analysis. This research focused particularly on reflective strategies that occurred inside process drama work and the way in which meaning was constructed in that context.  The central research question asked: 'In what ways does process drama work to assist people to reflect on their attitudes and behaviours associated with mental illness?'  This raised a secondary question: 'What potential is there for a model to counter stigma and discrimination that uses process drama as a central strategy?' This thesis posits a new model for understanding the nature of reflection in process drama.  The mimetic notions of the fictional and the real as discrete and defined entities should instead be seen as permeable frames of existence that on occasions collide and collapse into each other.  The double paradox of process drama is that, having created an empathetic relationship with the roles taken, we purposefully structure distance so we can then deliberately collapse the distance to create deep moments of reflection. I suggest a more accurate term to describe reflection in process drama is refraction.  Refraction acknowledges that, rather than clarity, process drama seeks ambiguity: instead of resolving issues it seeks to further problematise and complexify.  The tension of working with a democratic and open-ended art form towards a pre-ordained end as part of the project is closely examined.  The impact of performative rituals and proto drama processes as part of the context of working in Maori settings is also explored. A three step model for countering stigma and discrimination is formulated and workshopped.  The content of the model is based on an analysis of research undertaken within an anti-racist context, and models that have informed similar mental health campaigns.  The form of the model is process drama. An analysis of the workshops demonstrated that the first model developed was limited in its effectiveness.  Instead, participants should engage in repeating cycles of generating and investigating images.  This leads to the development of what I have termed the Spiral Three Step Model.  Although the effectiveness of the Spiral model is not tested in this research, it became apparent that the workshops based on this structure provided opportunities for participants to consider and reflect/refract deeply on their workplace's attitudes and behaviours.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">process drama</field><field name="subject">mental illness</field><field name="subject">mentally ill</field><field name="subject">reflection</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Maoris</field><field name="subject">drama therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031210.113358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Effective Partnerships in Natural Resource Management</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Peter Edward</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to understand and improve the effectiveness of partnerships formed by industry, community and government members of natural resource management (NRM) groups. The increasing popularity of partnership-based approaches to NRM is reflected in the rise of landcare, catchment management and other social mobilisation approaches throughout Australia and overseas. This thesis uses critical ethnographic methods to identify the characteristics of effective NRM partnerships and the factors influencing their effectiveness. This research also investigates appropriate methods for evaluating the effectiveness of such relationships and for determining when working in partnership with others may be the most appropriate response to a given NRM problem and context. The critical intent of the study means that it sought not only to understand the nature of such issues but also sought to enlighten and empower participants to improve the practice of partnerships in natural resource management. These characteristics and factors are analysed from three perspectives: the coordinators employed to broker and facilitate community-based NRM groups, the groups themselves and individual group members. This was done in order to reflect the importance of the continuous (re)negotiation of power that characterises long-term group relationships. It also enabled theories of power, cultural transformation, citizen participation, social capital and social learning to be used in the analysis of the NRM partnerships investigated in this study. These concepts were used to develop three tools for analysing NRM partnerships: a pendulum of citizen participation, an NRM citizen participation decision tree, and an NRM partnership typology.  The study is based upon the analysis of nineteen cases, predominantly in South East Queensland, which were selected as examples of successful and effective NRM partnerships on the basis of referrals from regional managers and coordinators from State and Local Government. The research design was 'T' shaped, with Phase 1 of the study providing breadth through the analysis of fifteen partnerships. Depth was achieved in Phases 2 and 3. Phase 2 was a long-term ethnographic case study of one catchment management group while Phase 3 comprised a detailed analysis of three issue-specific partnerships formed by this group. These three phases concentrated on the viewpoint of coordinators, NRM groups and participants, respectively. Data on each of the nineteen cases were collected through interviews, field observations, workshops, document analyses and a short questionnaire. Data were analysed qualitatively. All data records were systematically coded to reveal themes and concepts relating to the research objectives from the viewpoints of coordinators, NRM groups and participants. Coding also revealed implications for governments seeking to enter into or to facilitate partnerships with others.  The coding and interpretation of this data revealed a suite of twelve characteristics typical of effective natural resource management partnerships. These fell into five groups: (i) definitional characteristics (relating to effectiveness and shared power and responsibility) (ii) relationship characteristics (focusing on social capital building processes; communication; processes for knowledge acquisition and social learning; shared values, intent, action and risk-taking) (iii) participant characteristics (high levels of motivation and realistic expectations); (iv) a context characteristic (that the context is appropriate for a partnership) and (v) an 'outsider' perception characteristic (that the partnership is perceive positively by outsiders). A comparative analysis of cases reveals that only one of the nineteen cases exhibited all twelve characteristics. Importantly, three of these characteristics are not mentioned in the literature reviewed for this thesis. Two of these, share values and shared intent are relationship characteristics. Study findings emphasise that effective NRM partnerships are built on good personal relationships, based on shared values and intent. The third new characteristic is that people outside the partnership should perceive the relationship favourably. Since funds and other resources may be under the control of people outside a partnership, it is important that participants are able to effectively communicate their shared values and intent to others.  Five factors were found to be significant in the development of effective partnerships (i) the need for participants and those brokering partnerships to realize that effective partnerships are built on positive personal relationships in which (ii) participants have high levels of motivation for being involved, particularly early in the relationship. The study further revealed that such relationships: (iii) need to be supported by a continuity of adequate funding and resources and (iv) the services of skilled, enthusiastic coordinators who (v) enjoy and are skilled at working in 'grey areas', the constantly changing social and organizational environment that is typical of NRM groups.  These findings of the study are synthesized through a critical ethnography which depicts three years in the life of a typical, yet hypothetical, NRM group, the Armstrong Narrows-Yarooba Catchment Management Group (ANY Group). Based on the literature review and the analysis of results from this study, this composite story protects the anonymity of those who have participated in this research. Each of the three vignettes that make up this story contains two sections -As it was and As it could be. This 'double take approach' highlights the critical nature of the ethnography, emphasising how the development of collaborations and partnerships among members of NRM groups may be improved and evaluated. Coordinators, NRM group members and agencies supporting their efforts may use this ethnography as a basis for reflection and deliberation on the development of effective partnerships in natural resource management. Recommendations for how different stakeholders in NRM partnerships may develop the effectiveness of the partnerships they form are provided.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural resource management partnerships</field><field name="subject">partner</field><field name="subject">partnering</field><field name="subject">partners</field><field name="subject">partnership</field><field name="subject">NRM</field><field name="subject">landcare</field><field name="subject">catchment management</field><field name="subject">community groups</field><field name="subject">community-based NRM</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">industry</field><field name="subject">South-East Queensland</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">critical ethnography</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040802.163341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language for Emotions in Adolescence: Effects of Age, Gender, and Type of Emotional Disorder</field><field name="creator">O'Kearney, Richard</field><field name="description">Recent research on the early development of knowledge about emotions shows that young children's use and comprehension of emotion language develops from an initial emphasis on expressive/behavioural referents to situational terms towards referents emphasising the sub] ective/experiential nature of emotions. Gender, the type of emotion, the discourse context of the emotion talk and individual differences in strategies to regulate negative emotions are some factors that are shown to moderate the development of emotion language abilities. However, as most of the data comes from early language users there are significant limitations to our knowledge of emotion language development and its implications for emotion regulation. This thesis examines emotion language in early to middle adolescence. It develops a theoretically derived classification model to study the representational and causal structure of emotions evident in the emotion language of 13 to 17 yearolds. Study 1 uses a group format to sample descriptive accounts of emotions and their causes from a normative sample of 303 adolescents in response to emotionally relevant vignettes prototypical of anger and fear. Study 2 compares the lepresentational structure and quality of emotion language between 21 adolescents diagnosed with extemalising disorders (Conduct disorder, Oppositional Defiant disorder), 18 with internalising disorders (Depressive disorders, Anxiety disorders) and 16 without a disorder. It broadens the types of emotion eliciting material by including autobiographical events and an actual emotional challenge as well as the vignette stimuli. In addition, the second study uses an individual participant-interviewer procedure. Results of Study 1 indicated increase in the range and complexity of emotion referents and causal accounts of emotions from early to middle adolescents. Despite an increase in internalist/subjective causal accounts of emotions with age, there was a move towards a more externalised or situational focus in the representation of emotions for the older adolescents in response to the anger material. The findings showed that the ability to distinguish between sadness and anger and appropriately use anger and sad referents develops relatively late with some younger adolescents continuing to have difficulties with this distinction. There were a number of specific gender related differences in emotion language consistent with gender differences in display rules for emotions. In particular, boys showed a preference for expressive/behavioural emotion referents while girls preferred referents with a cognitive focus and use more inner-focused referents. Study 1 also provided initial data about differences between adolescents with extemalising problems, those with intemalising problems and non-problem adolescents. Results indicated more use of non-specific referents by adolescents with extemalising behavioural problems as well as less intensity and involvement in their emotion referents. Adolescents with extemalising problems were more likely to use non-specific referents in responses to anger material than those with intemalising problems. The results of Study 2 showed that adolescents with oppositional and conduct problems show deficits in the fluency, complexity and degree of specification of their emotion language and their causal accounts of emotions compared to non- problem youth and those with depression and anxiety problems. In addition, adolescents with intcmalising problems were less fluent in the production of causal accounts of emotions and used less specific emotion referents to fear events compared to non-problem youth. The results highlight the finding that emotion language is affected differentially for extemalising and internalising adolescents depending on the nature of the emotion-eliciting event. In particular, intemalising youth's language responses to anger events are characterised by inner-directed referents, and reduced intensity and involvement while their conceptualisation of salient fear material is dominated by cognitively focused terms and accounts. Extemalising adolescents language responses to anger events are more outer-directed and intense, and their emotion construals in a fear situation less cognitive and more affect orientated. The data from these studies highlight the need to study emotion language for specific emotion domains, and suggest that the most interesting theoretical questions are in respect of emotion understanding and emotion language abilities for specific behavioural and emotional disorders. The results also support the utility of an approach that combines knowledge about emotion language from the psychological and linguistic literature. It argues for an expansion of our knowledge about the development of the lexicon for emotions and other syntactic and pragmatic linguistic competencies that are important for conceptualising emotions in language. Such an expansion is crucial to investigating associations between early emotional competencies assessed through language and later outcomes in terms of behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emotions</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">emotional talk</field><field name="subject">emotional disorder</field><field name="subject">emotions in adolescence</field><field name="subject">developmental psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050831.145059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Farm Tourism in Australia: A Family Business and Rural Studies Perspective</field><field name="creator">Ollenburg, Claudia</field><field name="description">This research examines the Australian farm tourism sector within both family business and rural studies research paradigms.  It analyses which farmers in Australia establish farm tourism businesses, and why.  It extends previous research on farm tourism both in breadth, by covering an entire continent; and in depth, using qualitative approaches to determine the internal and external triggers for individual decisions, as well as quantitative approaches to establish the operational structure of the sector and the overall motivations of its operators. There were three separate stages to this study, with an increasingly detailed focus.  In the first, a national database of farm tourism operators was constructed from publicly available sources.  In the second phase, a 92 item questionnaire was mailed to every operator, with a response rate just below 50%.  In the third phase, detailed interviews were conducted with 43 farm tourism operators either on site or by telephone. There are over 650 working farms which offer farm based tourism products in Australia.  A few are large, remote and luxurious, but the majority are small, family priced and close to major population centres.  There are around 14,000 beds, with mean occupancy rate 35%, and total annual turnover AUS$115 million. Only 0.2% of Australian farmers have taken up tourism, as compared with 10-20% in some European countries. There are four major groups of farm tourism operators in Australia:  full time farms, part time farms, retirement farms and lifestyle farms.  There are statistically significant differences between these groups in the make up of their income streams, and in their motivations and family structures. Australian farm tourism operators attach slightly more significance to social than financial gains.  Particular groups of operators, however, do indeed rely on farm tourism as a key income stream.  For lifestyle operators, the farm component is principally a lifestyle luxury and a tourism attraction, with tourism generating the principal income.  For retirement farmers, farming is no longer at a commercially viable scale, and tourism provides the cashflow to keep the operators on their farm property during semi retirement.  For part time operators, tourism provides an income stream in addition and, where possible, in preference to off farm employment, for farm families having difficulty making ends meet.  For full time farmers, tourism is not seen as a long term important income source, but as a diversification option which enabled them to survive external economic shocks caused by changes in commodity prices or government policies. Whereas an income from farm tourism seems to have been an important stopgap or supplement which allows the operators to maintain their farms and farming lifestyles, it does not necessarily generate sufficient income to support two generations on the same property.  At least to date, therefore, it appears that farm tourism cannot be relied upon routinely as a new lifeline for rural communities in Australia.  It does indeed have a role to play, but the role may be different in different parts of the country.  In the more remote areas, farm tourism can provide a buffer for an older generation of farming families, helping to maintain stability in rural communities and land tenure.  In areas popular with amenity migrants, however, farm tourism may act as an agent of change, part of a package which brings former urban professionals to a rural semi retirement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Farm tourism</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">family farm business</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070717.165555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unravelling the Mystery: A Study of Reflection-in-Action in Process Drama Teaching</field><field name="creator">O'Mara, Joanne</field><field name="description">Unravelling the Mystery is a qualitative case study that examines the teacher researcher's reflection-in-action as she teaches using process drama. The teacher-researcher taught a class of Year Seven students for a school year. She worked with the students using process drama from 2-5 hours per week. All sessions were recorded and transcribed as part of the reflective practice research. They were then examined to study how the teacher might use reflection-in-action. The data is written as a series of vignettes. The vignettes are used to illustrate reflection-in-action and as a basis for discussion and analysis. In the thesis the data from five of these sessions is presented as vignettes-these vignettes illustrating the teacher's reflection-in-action process. The analysis focuses on the reflection-in-action for the teacher. The vignettes and accompanying analysis for the basis for an illustrative model of the scope of the teacher' reflection-in-action as she works using process drama. The study addresses the following questions: &#183; How might reflective practice inform my teaching? &#183; How can I as a researcher describe and document my reflection-in-action when working as a teacher in process drama? &#183; What is the scope of my reflection-in-action when working as the teacher in process drama? &#183; How might an increased understanding of reflection-in-action be useful to teachers of process drama? These questions are considered in light of the analysis and literature review. The study concludes that reflective practice is valuable to enable teachers to develop their practice. It recommends that this type of research is beneficial to both develop models of practice and to improve the practice of individual practitioners.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reflection-in-action</field><field name="subject">reflective practice</field><field name="subject">empathy</field><field name="subject">process drama</field><field name="subject">teacher-researcher</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030228.103642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fire and Ice: Partner Aggression and Withdrawal</field><field name="creator">O'Rourke, Patricia</field><field name="description">Family-of-origin aggression (FOOA) is an established risk factor for adult partner aggression.  The research presented in this thesis tested a model proposing that (FOOA) is mediated through attachment and attributions to influence male and female partner aggression and withdrawal in early stage couple relationships.  Study 1 tested the influence of FOOA, attachment, and attributions on partner aggression in a sample of 73 newlywed couples.  FOOA was associated with male-to-female aggression, but not female-to-male aggression.  Therefore the hypothesis that the influence of FOOA on partner aggression was mediated through attachment and attributions was tested only for men.  Attachment was significantly associated with attributions, but there was no association between FOOA and attachment or between attributions and male partner aggression. Study 2 tested the influence of FOOA, attachment, and attributions on partner aggression and withdrawal in a sample of 101 dating couples.  Structural equation model analyses found different results for men and women. For male partner aggression, the influence of FOOA was partially mediated through attachment and attributions.  For male withdrawal, the influence of FOOA on withdrawal was fully mediated through attachment and attributions.  The association between FOOA and withdrawal was also mediated through attachment independent of attributions, and through attributions independent of attachment.  For female partner aggression and female withdrawal, the predicted associations were found for the attachment anxiety models but not for the attachment avoidance models.  The current findings suggest that attachment and attributions should be intervention targets for improving relationship outcomes.  The gender differences in model fit emphasise the importance of investigating risk factors for partner aggression and withdrawal separately for men and women.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family-of-origin aggression</field><field name="subject">adult partner aggression</field><field name="subject">male-to-female aggression</field><field name="subject">female-to-male aggression</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070723.095445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-deploying State Capacities: The Project of Financial Deregulation in Costa Rica (1980-2000)</field><field name="creator">Pacheco, Douglas Vladimir</field><field name="description">Observers of neo-liberal persuasion claim that a financial system free of government regulation can lead to better allocation of resources and if the actual process of deregulation is done properly, the results can benefit society as a whole. Deregulation requires dismantling those state-based banking structures that are perceived as economically inefficient. This approach sets up a dichotomy between financial deregulation, which is portrayed as an intrinsic part of economic progress, and state regulation, which is seen as a force that interferes with entrepreneurial freedom and efficiency. This thesis argues that such a dichotomy can only be possible within the dominant neo-liberal discourses on the economy that have displaced Keynesian style economic management in core and peripheral areas of the world. Following Marxist structural approaches I also argue that financial deregulation is a class-based project that opens up profit sites and reflects the crisis in capitalist accumulation occurring in the latter part of the 20th century. Unlike neo-liberal followers I contend that the role of the state in maintaining and/or transforming capitalist structures in order to achieve certain outcomes (whatever they might be) is crucial in nation-building strategies in peripheral countries such as Costa Rica. As in many other countries, credit allocation was actively used in this country, for some thirty years in order to achieve high levels of investment, economic planning and re-distributive policies. However, the once fully nationalised banking system, as one of the few mechanisms available to the state to regulate savings and offer credit to different socio-economic groups, has gone through dramatic changes in the period from 1980-2000.  Using a modified version of Hirschman's exit/voice framework for financial systems and available institutional data, I suggest that Costa Rica has moved from having a financial system that was predominantly owned by the state (public) and whose institutional arrangements were elite-led to one whose ownership is mixed but still led by elites. However if the trend persists I anticipate that it will become a predominantly privately owned system with an equal mixture of elite-voice and exit institutions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Costa Rica</field><field name="subject">financial deregulation</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">economic development</field><field name="subject">bank</field><field name="subject">banks</field><field name="subject">banking</field><field name="subject">finance</field><field name="subject">State</field><field name="subject">private ownership</field><field name="subject">privatisation</field><field name="subject">privatization</field><field name="subject">capitalism</field><field name="subject">neo-liberalism</field><field name="subject">neoliberalism</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040524.125316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Evolutionary History of the Freshwater Shrimp Family Atyidae in Australia</field><field name="creator">Page, Timothy J</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to use phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA to investigate the biogeography and evolutionary relationships within the freshwater shrimp family Atyidae in Australia at a nested series of scales, both geographic and systematic.  At the largest scale, the relationships between Australian and Indo-West Pacific species were inferred using the two most common atyid genera in Australia, Caridina and Paratya.  Most atyids are hypothesised to have colonised Australia from Southeast Asia, but Paratya may be a Gondwanan relict given its distribution.  Australian Paratya all form a strong clade, with a sister relationship to species from Tasman Sea islands.  Molecular clock estimates place all of the splits within Paratya after the break-up of Gondwana, with Australia being colonised once 3&#189;-8&#189; million years ago.  This transoceanic dispersal is conjectured to have taken place through oceanic currents because of the amphidromous life cycle of some taxa of Paratya. Caridina has a very different biogeographic history in Australia, as numerous Australian species have close evolutionary relationships with non-Australian taxa from locations throughout the region.  This implies many colonisations to or from Australia over a long period, and thus highlights the surprising adeptness of freshwater shrimp in dispersal across ocean barriers and the unity of much of the region's freshwater biota.  A number of potential species radiations within Australia were also identified.  This agrees with patterns detected for a large number of Australian freshwater taxa, and implies a vicariant explanation due to the development of colder, dryer climates. The systematic relationships of the remaining two Australian surface genera (Caridinides, Australatya) and two subterranean genera (Parisia, Pycnisia) were also investigated.  Australatya forms a strong clade with Pacific 'Atya-like' genera, and Caridinides falls within a clade containing Australian Caridina.  The hypogean genera, Parisia and Pycnisia, form a strong clade in all analyses, implying an Australian subterranean speciation.  The possibility of a relationship between Parisia/Pycnisia and some Australian Caridina species may have implications for the monophyly of the highly disjunct genus Parisia, as it may descend from local Caridina species and represent convergent morphologies. The common and speciose genus Caridina was used as a model taxon for analyses within Australia.  At the medium scale, molecular taxonomic techniques were used to uncover cryptic species within a problematic east Australian species complex.  At least five species were detected.  Phylogeographic and population genetic analyses were carried out on each of these five cryptic species, which diverged from each other in the late Miocene/Pliocene.  There were very large differences between the species in the scales of overall geographic distribution, intraspecific divergence and population structure.  These were characterised as either: 1) species with large ranges, low intraspecific divergence, limited phylogeographic structuring (Caridina sp. D); 2) species with large ranges, high intraspecific divergence, a high level of phylogeographic structuring (sp. B); 3) species with a limited range, low intraspecific divergence, no phylogeographic structuring (sp. E); or 4) species with limited ranges, high intraspecific divergences, a high level of phylogeographic structuring (sp. A &amp; C).  These patterns reflect a combination of large-scale factors, such as landscape structure and climate change, and small-scale factors, such as species-specific tolerances to local conditions and differing dispersal capabilities.  Life history variation (egg size) between species may be correlated with different dispersal abilities.  Species with the smallest eggs have the least intraspecific divergence and largest distribution, while those with the biggest eggs have the most divergence and smallest distribution, with medium-sized egg species in between. At the smallest phylogeographic scale, C. sp. C  from the sand dune islands of Moreton Bay in southeastern Queensland was further analysed.  Two different lineages (C1, C2) were found which diverged from each other during the late Miocene/Pliocene and so are older than the current landscape in which they are found.  Small-scale phylogeographic analyses within C1, C2 and a sympatric fish identified divergences dating to the Pleistocene (about 100-300 thousand years ago).  This implies that ice age sea-level changes may have structured these populations, although there is little observable influence of the last glacial maximum (about 18 thousand years ago). This study has highlighted a number of taxonomic anomalies within the Atyidae.  The detection of many cryptic species implies that biodiversity within freshwater invertebrates is higher than currently appreciated.  The evolutionary and biogeographic relationships of Australian atyids have proved complex, with many taxa having their own individual histories.  At the large Indo-Pacific scale, dispersal is most evident, but within Australia, both vicariance and dispersal have been responsible for structuring all taxa at every scale.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fresh water shrimp</field><field name="subject">Atyidae</field><field name="subject">species caridina</field><field name="subject">genus parisia</field><field name="subject">Caridinides</field><field name="subject">Australatya</field><field name="subject">Parisia</field><field name="subject">Pycnisia</field><field name="subject">phylogenetic analyses</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070725.120145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">State Police in a State of Change: Remaking the Entrepreneurial Officer</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Darren</field><field name="description">We are currently at a point in time in Australia where questions concerning how to govern police have never been more pressing or more fluid. Systemic corruption has been identified in several states; a range of new accountability mechanisms have been established internal and external to police and in Victoria police corruption has been linked with a violent 'gangland war'. This thesis locates these contemporary developments within a broader analysis of the historical circumstances shaping the changing techniques for governing state police. More specifically, this thesis engages in a detailed comparative study of the changing techniques of governing police in Queensland and Victoria. The theoretical tools to conduct this analysis are drawn from 'governmentality studies'. This refers to a broad grouping of theoretical scholarship concerned with the changing ideas - or 'political rationalities' - on how to govern some thing or some activity, and the underlying reasoning, justifications and ambitions contained within the practical tools or 'techniques' used to govern. Central to the thesis is an argument that a new politics of policing has emerged recently, one that extends the dyad of the old accountability - 'police powers' and 'external accountability' - to a pluralisation of accountability processes and structures. The thesis argues that governmentality studies offer new insights into ways of analysing the techniques for governing state police, increasingly shaped by the managerialisation of governing and embodying efforts to make police innovative, risk-taking problems-solvers. This is what I refer to as an open-ended normative project for re-making the entrepreneurial officer. However, a detailed examination of the development of governmental techniques for 'making up' the entrepreneurial officer indicates that such a governmental project is not implemented unproblematically. Nonetheless, the thesis concludes that the attempts to remake the entrepreneurial officer through the managerialisation of governing presents distinct possibilities for a new 'politics of policing' that fosters deliberative, reflective police practice within a new framework of police accountabilities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">State police</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">policemen</field><field name="subject">police powers</field><field name="subject">accountability in public office</field><field name="subject">police accountabilities</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051129.152016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business Partnership Relationships in the Chinese Inbound Tourism Market to Australia</field><field name="creator">Pan, Grace Wen</field><field name="description">The Chinese inbound tourism market to Australia has been acknowledged as an emerging market and a major export earner. However, Australian inbound tour operators experience difficulties in establishing and developing viable partner relationships with Chinese travel agents. Recognising the size, importance and complexity of this market, the major purpose of this research is to explore and investigate the crucial process of developing Sino-Australian partnership relationships in the tourism industry, and to educate Australian tourism operatives about this process to facilitate the establishment of business relationships with Chinese travel agents. Hence, the principal research question posed in this thesis is: How might Australian tourism product suppliers and marketers establish and maintain partnership relationships with Chinese travel agents to help Australia become a preferred tourist destination for Chinese tourists? This study is exploratory in nature and draws on applied marketing, management and cross-cultural theories on networking to explore the process of developing partnership relationships in the Chinese inbound tourism market to Australia. The literature on networking, and the development of networking relationships, has been theorised drawing principally on the marketing and management literature. The impact of cross-cultural differences and the effect of guanxi (connection), a key feature of Chinese business networking, on partnership relations between Chinese travel agents and Australian inbound tour operators, is also reviewed and discussed. One of the main contributions of this research is its multidisciplinary nature, drawing on relationship marketing and network theories and applying them to tourism research. Little research has been undertaken into tourism-based partnership relations in the cross-national context. Given the limited research conducted on this topic and its cross-cultural nature, a qualitative research method was adopted for this study. Specifically, this study utilised in-depth interviewing techniques to explore the relationships between Australian inbound tour operators and Chinese travel agents. This study identifies that the process of developing partnership relationships between Chinese travel agents and Australian inbound tour operators is, as expected, highly culturally embedded but in unexpected ways. Although all the Australian inbound tour operators in the study are of Chinese descent, they have adapted to Australian culture and business ethics, giving rise to communication problems that affect partnership relationships. A new stage model of the development of partnership relationships between Australian inbound tour operators and Chinese travel agents is therefore developed by incorporating cross-cultural factors into Western theories on networking and relationship marketing. In particular, the thesis identifies important factors in each stage of the process of developing business relationships. For example, resilient trust and mutual commitment, the pricing issue, word-of-mouth, and quality of services are all considered crucial in attaining long-term stable partnership relationships. Disproving popular myths about guanxi in some of the previous literature, the findings from this research demonstrate that, in China's economic transition period, guanxi plays a significant, but not decisive role in the process of developing partnership relationships between Chinese travel agents and Australian inbound tour operators. However, guanxi relationships can provide added value to the partnership relationships of Australian operators.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">tourist</field><field name="subject">tourists</field><field name="subject">inbound</field><field name="subject">in-bound</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">market</field><field name="subject">markets</field><field name="subject">partner</field><field name="subject">partners</field><field name="subject">partnership</field><field name="subject">partnerships</field><field name="subject">business</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural</field><field name="subject">network</field><field name="subject">networks</field><field name="subject">networking</field><field name="subject">guanxi</field><field name="subject">relationship marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040719.110427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australia, Taiwan and the PRC: Evolving Relations</field><field name="creator">Papadimos, Andrew</field><field name="description">In December 1972 the Australian government recognised the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) at the cost of breaking off all official contacts with Taiwan. Despite the initial shock to Australia-Taiwan relations of derecognition, trade contacts between Australia and Taiwan have continued to flourish, and in recent years, political relations between the two have also been improving. This thesis examines reasons behind the recent improvements in Australia-Taiwan relations and ways in which such improvements have been implemented - given the constraints that Australia has no official contacts with Taiwan. With its main focus as trade, this thesis shows that Taiwan's importance to Australia has been slowly evolving such that Taiwan is at present a more important and reliable trading partner to Australia than is the PRC. Improvements have been occurring in Australia-Taiwan political relations, therefore, primarily as a consequence of Taiwan's growing importan&#233;e in the Australian marketplace.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">People's republic of China</field><field name="subject">international relations</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050831.170440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple Levels of Regulation of Human SECIS Binding Protein 2, SBP2</field><field name="creator">Papp, Laura V</field><field name="description">Selenium is an essential trace mineral of fundamental importance to human health. Its beneficial functions are largely attributed to its presence within a group of proteins named selenoproteins in the form of the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Recently, it was revealed that the human selenoproteome consists of 25 selenoproteins, and for many of them their function remains unknown. The most prominent known roles of selenoproteins are to maintain the intracellular redox homeostasis, redox regulation of intracellular signalling and thyroid hormone metabolism. Sec incorporation into selenoproteins employs a unique mechanism that involves decoding of the UGA stop codon. The process requires interplay between distinct, intrinsic features such as the Sec Insertion Sequence (SECIS) element, the tRNASec and multiple protein factors. The work presented in this thesis has focused on characterising the regulation of human SECIS binding protein 2, SBP2, a factor central to this process. Experimental approaches combined with bioinformatics analysis revealed that SBP2 is subjected to alternative splicing. A total of nine alternatively spliced transcripts appear to be expressed in cells, potentially encoding five different protein isoforms. The alternative splicing events are restricted to the 5?-region, which is proposed to be dispensable for Sec incorporation. One of the variants identified, contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence that was capable of targetting SBP2 into the mitochondrial compartment. This isoform also appears to be expressed endogenously within the mitochondria in cells. Previous reports have depicted SBP2 as a ribosomal protein, despite the presence of a putative Nuclear Localisation Signal (NLS). In this study it was found that SBP2 subcellular localisation is not restricted to ribosomes. Intrinsic functional NLS and Nuclear Export Signals (NESs), enable SBP2 to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm via the CRM1 pathway. In addition, the subcellular localisation of SBP2 appears to play an important role in regulating Sec incorporation into selenoproteins. The subcellular localisation of SBP2 is altered by conditions imposing oxidative stress. Several oxidising agents induce the nuclear accumulation of SBP2, which occurs via oxidation of cysteine residues within a novel redox-sensitive cysteine rich domain (CRD). Cysteine residues were to form disulfide bonds and glutathione-mixed disulfides during oxidising conditions, which are efficiently reversed in vitro by the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems, respectively. These modifications negatively regulate selenoprotein synthesis. Cells depleted of SBP2 are more sensitive to oxidative stress than control cells, which correlated with a substantial decrease in selenoprotein synthesis after treatment with oxidising agents. These results provide direct evidence that SBP2 is required for Sec incorporation in vivo and suggest that nuclear sequestration of SBP2 under such conditions may represent a mechanism to regulate the expression of selenoproteins. Collectively, these results suggest that SBP2 is regulated at multiple levels: by alternative splicing, changes in subcellar localisation and redox control.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Selenium</field><field name="subject">selenoproteins</field><field name="subject">amino acid selenocysteine</field><field name="subject">human selenoproteome</field><field name="subject">intracellular redox homeostasis</field><field name="subject">SEC insertion sequence</field><field name="subject">protein 2</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070208.145623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the Church in the Rural Communities of South West Queensland</field><field name="creator">Park, Noel Roy</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to explore the role of the Church in rural areas with specific reference to the South West region of Queensland and focusing on the provision of social welfare services. The region of Queensland, described by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as the South West, lies to the west of Brisbane, commencing at Yuleba, and stretches to the South Australian border. The region was populated by between ten and fifteen indigenous nations prior to European settlement. Since the 1840s the South West has seen the development of primary industries and the formation of rural communities. A grounded theory research approach was used in this study, which drew upon data collected through a series of programs conducted by the community support agency Lifeline. These data sets included individual stories of extreme hardship, connected chains of evidence and group responses. They provided an overview of the issues facing residents of the South West, including those issues pertinent to the role of Christian denominations throughout the region. The significant issues which emerged from the study related to the concerns of rural residents over their personal health, their self image, the state of their interpersonal relationships, the viability of their enterprises, the loss of community facilities, and the decreasing rural population. With specific reference to the Church, respondents indicated that harsh conditions had challenged their faith, reduced their ability to be involved in church-based activities and added to their concerns over the reduction of resident clergy and Church facilities in rural areas. Respondents in the study presented a widespread sense of powerlessness in regard to decisions made regarding funding for their local communities and management decisions made by Church authorities without any local consultation. The conclusions from this study indicate that the Church does have an ongoing role in rural communities provided that the Christian denominations recognise and respond to the concerns of the rural residents in regard to denominational structures, rural theology and the principles underlying the provision of rural social services. The study recommends that the Christian denominations put into practice the statements which have been made by denominational leaders in regard to the formation of an ecumenical training program for clergy and lay leaders who may work in rural areas. An urgent need is revealed for a new approach to gender issues so that the role of women in rural industry, producer organizations, government committees and Church management can be examined as broadly as possible. The study also indicated the need for further research into the future of Australia's rural communities and the ways in which they may differ as communities from the urban areas of Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church and community (Queensland)</field><field name="subject">rural societies (Queensland)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070117.112020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managers' Perception of Market Competition, Transformational Leadership, Use of MAS Information and Performance: A Cross-Cultural Study in Hotels</field><field name="creator">Patiar, Anoop Kumar</field><field name="description">Increasing market competition, globalisation, technological advancements and customers' awareness of service quality has contributed to environmental uncertainty within the hotel industry (Atkinson &amp; Brander Brown, 2001; Brander Brown &amp; Atkinson, 2001; Harris &amp; Mongiello, 2001; Sanchez, 1997).  Several researchers argue that managers' perceived uncertainty can be better managed if the general manager practises a transformational leadership style (i.e., the superior shares the organisational vision with subordinates and genuinely motivates them) (Hinkin &amp; Tracey, 1994; Lockwood &amp; Jones, 1989; Tracey &amp; Hinkin, 1996; Zetie, Sparrow, Woodfield &amp; Kilmartin, 1994; Zohar, 1994).  Furthermore, the use of broad scope MAS (management accounting systems) information helps to reduce uncertainty and complexity, thereby improving decision-making (Biema &amp; Greenwald, 1997; Chen, 1996; Chenhall &amp; Morris, 1986; Gordon &amp; Narayanan, 1984; Mia &amp; Clarke, 1999; Sanchez, 1997). This study examined the relationship between hotel department managers' perception of the intensity of market competition, their general manager's (i.e., the superior's) transformational leadership style and the use of broad scope MAS information, and its effect on departmental performance (i.e., financial, non-financial and overall change in performance).  In addition, this study investigated the moderating effect of national culture on the above relationship using Hofstede's (1980) theoretical framework including power distance and individualism dimensions, and undertaking the study in the Australian and Indian hotel industry. A cross-sectional design was used to present a snapshot of the relationship mentioned in the previous paragraph.  In particular, two research methods-a self-administered postal survey questionnaire and face-to-face interviews-were used to improve the generalisation of the results.  In total, 82 four and five star hotels (66 hotels in Australia and the remaining 16 in India) with more than 160 bedrooms returned completed and usable questionnaires.  From each of the hotels and resorts, food and beverage as well as the room's department managers participated in the study.  The data was gathered with the help of well-established instruments that were adapted for the hotel environment.  For example, Gupta and Govindrajan's (1984) departmental performance scale; Khandwalla's (1972) market competition scale; Bass and Avolio's (1997) MLQ-5X transformational leadership scale; Chenhall and Morris's (1986) broad scope MAS information scale and Hofstede's (1980) national culture scale.  In addition, major issues covered in the survey questionnaire were further discussed in face-to-face interviews with selected hotel department managers.  While the quantitative data was analysed using standard descriptive statistics as well as inferential statistics (i.e., t-test and hierarchical multiple regression techniques), qualitative data was analysed using summary tables. The quantitative and qualitative analysis resulting from the survey questionnaire and face-to-face interviews with hotel department managers provided support for the two sets of findings.  Firstly, the basic performance model revealed a significant and positive three-way interaction between market competition, transformational leadership style, broad scope MAS information use and departmental performance consisting of financial performance, overall change in departmental performance as well as change in departmental revenue in the past two years prior to the study.  Further analysis confirmed that improvement in departmental performance was apparent when general managers practised high, rather than low transformational leadership style, with no change in the level of market competition and broad scope MAS information use.  While a significant and positive direct effect of transformational leadership and broad scope MAS information use on departmental performance was evident, a significant and negative direct effect of market competition on departmental performance was also found. Secondly, Australian and Indian department managers exhibited, a significant difference in national culture, transformational leadership, market competition and MAS use, but no significant difference in departmental performance was evident.  The moderating effect of national culture on the basic performance model showed that in India, culture had no effect on the three-way interaction.  However, in Australia, a significant and positive three-way interaction was only evident for overall changes in departmental revenue.  Perhaps this long-term favourable outcome in Australia is due to the high transformational leadership style of hotel general managers, department managers' perception of high market competition and their increased use of broad scope MAS information. The theoretical and managerial implications of the study's results, limitations and future research directions are also discussed in the thesis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Market competition</field><field name="subject">transformational leadership</field><field name="subject">MAS information</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">customer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">hotel industry</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070131.094411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary Health Care Nursing: A Case Study Of Practice Nurses</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In 1978, Primary Health Care (PHC) was formally recognised, in the Declaration of Alma-Ata, as the key to achieving the World Health Organisation's goal of 'Health For All by the Year 2000' (HFA). PHC was seen as the solution to the inadequate illness management systems that had developed throughout the world. It was hoped that PHC would address some of the major inequalities in health observed both within and between countries by its balanced system of treatment and disease prevention. The WHO envisaged that PHC would take place as close as possible to where people live and work and be the first element of a continuing health care process. Additionally, health service collaboration and multi-professional partnerships were expected to replace professional boundaries and competition. Shortly after the Declaration of Alma-Ata, the World Health Organisation, supported by national and international nursing bodies, proposed that nurses would be the driving force behind the HFA movement as active partners in inter-professional teams, leaders in health care and resources to people rather than resources to other health professionals. In the ensuing years, although community health nurses were acknowledged by the government and the nursing profession as key players in PHC in Australia, practice nurses (nurses who are employed in general medical practices) were not identified within this group. Hence, it appeared as though these practice nurses were 'invisible', not considered important to PHC in Australia, or simply overlooked as a major influence on population health. The purpose of this study was to describe the current role of these nurses and to identify and analyse the factors that influenced their scope of practice and hence their contribution to PHC. The research was conducted as a case study of practice nurses in one Division of General Practice in southeast Queensland. The study was influenced by the constructivist paradigm of inquiry and utilised a complementary sequence of quantitative methods followed by qualitative investigation. The first stage of the study comprised a telephone followed by mail survey of general practitioners and practice nurses employed within the Division. This was followed by a second stage, which involved group and individual interviews of key informants and was supported by document review and observation. The study revealed that the practice nurse role is essentially one of assistant to the general practitioner wherein the nurse undertakes basic assessment procedures to aid the medical diagnosis, carries out delegated therapeutic procedures, and contributes to the administrative functioning of the practice. Autonomous nursing initiatives, which appear to be largely opportunistic and incidental to delegated activities, include physical and emotional support of patients, clarification and reinforcement of medical instructions, and the provision of health education. The practice nurse's role, and hence contribution to PHC, was found to be constrained by a number of factors. These factors include the current funding arrangements for general practice, the view that practice nurses are an option rather than a necessity, the general practitioners' control of the practice setting, the appropriation of nursing work to medical receptionists, the lack of professional development opportunities, and the practice nurses' passive acceptance of their circumstances. However, both general practitioners and practice nurses appreciate the value of nursing services in general practice and GPs would sanction the employment of more nurses, if given financial incentives, especially for the purpose of preventive care. The majority of practice nurses believe their role should be expanded to include autonomous functioning while most of the GPs were amenable to some extension of nursing practice but reticent or opposed to any independent interventions. There appears a need in Queensland for courses to prepare practice nurses for advanced practice if they want to expand their role in PHC beyond that of assistants to GPs. It would also seem to be in the nurses' interests to initiate a professional association of practice nurses as a vehicle to explore other issues relevant to their professional development. In addition, if PNs want to expand their role they will need to demonstrate improved patient outcomes and cost effectiveness.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Primary Health Care</field><field name="subject">Case Study</field><field name="subject">Practice Nursing</field><field name="subject">General Practice</field><field name="subject">Adanced Nursing Practice</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030228.104735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the Provision of Learning Assistance Services in Higher Education</field><field name="creator">Peach, Deborah</field><field name="description">This study is motivated by the need to look continually for ways to improve Griffith University&#146;s learning assistance services so that they meet the changing needs of stakeholders and are at the same time cost-effective and efficient. This study uses the conceptual tools of cultural-historical activity theory and expansive visibilisation to investigate the development and transformation of learning assistance services at Griffith University, one of Australia's largest multi-campus universities. Cultural-historical activity is a powerful theoretical framework that acknowledges the importance of dimensions such as cultural context, local setting, collective understanding, and the influence of historical variables on interactions in settings. Expansive visibilisation is a practical four-stage process that was used in this study to make visible and analysable the work context of the Learning Assistance Unit. The study uses these conceptual tools to illustrate how learning assistance services at the University have moved through several stages of historical development and that historical variables, such as the political setting and physical location of services continue to influence current work practices. The investigation involved gathering data through interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders in order to map the University's Learning Assistance Unit as an activity system that appears to have separated out from the overall activity system of the University. It involved making visible problems and tensions in the activity system, and identifying ways of improving future practice. The study reveals problem clusters and underlying tensions amongst the interacting activity systems of the Learning Assistance Unit, faculty, library and student. These problem clusters relate to different understandings about the purpose of the Learning Assistance Unit and the role of the learning adviser, the difficulties in offering a quality service on a restricted budget, and tensions between contextualised and de-contextualised learning assistance. The study suggests that resolving these tensions depends on staff taking an active role in critically examining their practice, in particular the way that they collaborate with key stakeholders in the learning environment. The dissertation concludes by suggesting that one way forward is to expand the activity system on its socio-spatial, temporal, moral-ideological, and systemic-developmental dimensions (Engestr&#246;m, 1999c).</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">learning assistance units</field><field name="subject">learning advisers</field><field name="subject">learning advisors</field><field name="subject">libraries</field><field name="subject">librarians</field><field name="subject">visibilisation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Griffith University</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040319.163140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inner Weavings: Cultural Appropriateness for a Torres Strait Island Woman Artist of Today</field><field name="creator">Peacock, Janice</field><field name="description">This exegesis examines the context of my studio work submitted for the degree of Doctor of Visual Art at Griffith University in 2004.

Using a sample of 59 couples the well-documented association between attachment insecurity and relationship satisfaction was replicated. I then tested whether this association was mediated by attributions for hypothetical behaviour for a real partner and a hypothetical potential partner. Attributions for real partner behaviour did mediate between insecure attachment and relationship satisfaction, but not attributions for a potential partner. It was further hypothesised that an association would exist between couple communication and attachment insecurity, which would be mediated by negative attributions. Couples completed two ten-minute problem-solving discussions and participated in a video-mediated recall process, providing a measure of attributions for real events with their current partner. Results supported the hypotheses for self-reported, but not observed, communication. It was concluded that the association between attachment and attributions does not represent a consistent cognitive processing bias, but rather a relationship-specific phenomena. Future research directions were proposed to investigate mediation from a long-term perspective and the therapeutic implications of these findings were discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attributions</field><field name="subject">negative attributions</field><field name="subject">relationship outcomes</field><field name="subject">attachment style</field><field name="subject">partner behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060301.154359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Couple CARE for Parents Program: Enhancing Couple Relationships Across the Transition to Parenthood</field><field name="creator">Petch, Jemima F</field><field name="description">Most couples eagerly anticipate the birth of their first child. However, the transition to parenthood is also associated with significant lifestyle changes and approximately 50% of couples report a moderate to severe decline in relationship satisfaction and quality. Low relationship satisfaction is associated with increased couple conflict, individual psychological distress, negative parent-child relationships and poor child outcomes. Despite our increasing knowledge of the factors that predict enhanced couple adjustment, few evidence-based programs are available to assist couples' adjustment to parenthood. In this first randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a flexible delivery psycho-education program, entitled 'Couple CARE for Parents', 71 pregnant couples were assessed on self-report and observational measures of couple relationship and individual functioning and then randomized into either the Couple CARE for Parents program (n = 35) or a comparison program (n = 36). Couple CARE for Parents was a six unit program, comprising of an antenatal workshop, two home visits and three telephone support calls, and included skill-training in key relationship processes that are predictive of couple relationship quality, with the addition of parenting and baby care information. Among intervention couples the typical decline in female relationship satisfaction was prevented, with only 13% of intervention females reporting a decline in relationship satisfaction from pregnancy to 5 months postpartum, compared to 42% of females in the comparison program. Observed couple communication also improved as a result of the intervention, with Couple CARE for Parents couples showing reliably lower rates of negative speaker and listener skills at post-intervention relative to comparison couples. Couples were highly engaged in Couple CARE for Parents and there was a low drop out rate across the 7 month intervention period. These findings are promising and add to the early intervention studies showing positive effects of couple-focused psycho-education during the transition to parenthood by demonstrating that flexible delivery programs are feasible and attractive to couples. Providing cost-effective couple relationship education to expectant and new parent couples opens another window of opportunity for health professionals and governments to minimize the rates of relationship distress and divorce and their associated negative effects on individual, couple and family functioning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parenthood</field><field name="subject">relationship satisfaction</field><field name="subject">negative parent-child relationships</field><field name="subject">flexible delivery psycho-education program</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070219.104652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and Exploiting Structures in Solving Propositional Satisfiability Problems</field><field name="creator">Pham, Duc Nghia</field><field name="description">Recent research has shown that it is often preferable to encode real-world problems as propositional satisfiability (SAT) problems and then solve using a general purpose SAT solver. However, much of the valuable information and structure of these realistic problems is flattened out and hidden inside the corresponding Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) encodings of the SAT domain. Recently, systematic SAT solvers have been progressively improved and are now able to solve many highly structured practical problems containing millions of clauses. In contrast, state-of-the-art Stochastic Local Search (SLS) solvers still have difficulty in solving structured problems, apparently because they are unable to exploit hidden structure as well as the systematic solvers. In this thesis, we study and evaluate different ways to effectively recognise, model and efficiently exploit useful structures hidden in realistic problems. A summary of the main contributions is as follows: 1. We first investigate an off-line processing phase that applies resolution-based pre-processors to input formulas before running SLS solvers on these problems. We report an extensive empirical examination of the impact of SAT pre-processing on the performance of contemporary SLS techniques. It emerges that while all the solvers examined do indeed benefit from pre-processing, the effects of different pre-processors are far from uniform across solvers and across problems. Our results suggest that SLS solvers need to be equipped with multiple pre-processors if they are ever to match the performance of systematic solvers on highly structured problems. [Part of this study was published at the AAAI-05 conference]. 2. We then look at potential approaches to bridging the gap between SAT and constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) formalisms. One approach has been to develop a many-valued SAT formalism (MV-SAT) as an intermediate paradigm between SAT and CSP, and then to translate existing highly efficient SAT solvers to the MV-SAT domain. In this study, we follow a different route, developing SAT solvers that can automatically recognise CSP structure hidden in SAT encodings. This allows us to look more closely at how constraint weighting can be implemented in the SAT and CSP domains. Our experimental results show that a SAT-based mechanism to handle weights, together with a CSP-based method to instantiate variables, is superior to other combinations of SAT and CSP-based approaches. In addition, SLS solvers based on this many-valued weighting approach outperform other existing approaches to handle many-valued CSP structures. [Part of this study was published at the AAAI-05 conference]. 3. Finally, we propose and evaluate six different schemes to encode temporal reasoning problems, in particular the Interval Algebra (IA) networks, into SAT CNF formulas. We then empirically examine the performance of local search as well as systematic solvers on the new temporal SAT representations, in comparison with solvers that operate on native IA representations. Our empirical results show that zChaff (a state-of-the-art complete SAT solver) together with the best IA-to-SAT encoding scheme, can solve temporal problems significantly faster than existing IA solvers working on the equivalent native IA networks.

The typical features of the integrated structure are the adding-up conditions and the two-way linkages between the national and the regional modules facilitated by the interface shifters. The adding-up conditions ensure the two modules produce consistent results and updated databases. The inclusion of the interface shifters on the one hand plays a role in ensuring compatibility of results of the two modules, i.e. no distortion occurs because technical or taste changes are transferred across modules. On the other hand, the interface shifters assist the operation of IRES in different modes: the model can be used as a top-down model, a bottom-up model or an integrated model where national and regional shocks can be introduced at the same time. Hence, IRES has more flexibility in its application than a regional model or a national model alone, as IRES can make use of availability of data at any levels in the economy. IRES has a new labour market in which regional migration is no longer the only factor that settles the labour market as in the original setting of the MMRF model. Regional unemployment and regional participation rates are modelled to response to changes in regional employment growth using elasticities estimated econometrically in this thesis. IRES implements historical patterns of regional migration so that results of regional migration are consistent with observed patterns. Altogether, regional migration, regional unemployment and participation rates determine the equilibrium of the labour market. IRES adopts new approaches to modelling margin demands and indirect taxes. These new approaches are very effective in reducing the size of IRES but they do not compromise the use of the model.

While the work attitudes and behaviours of staff who deliver these services can influence the experiences of service by customers, little is known how internal and external aspects of the environment of an organisation with a controversial service affect the empowerment, work attitudes and well-being of its employees. The aim of the present program of research was to identify employees' perceptions of the salient aspects of the internal and external environment of an organisation delivering a controversial service, gambling, and to examine the impact of these environmental aspects on the empowerment, commitment and well-being of its employees.  Working in any service organisation can be demanding for employees, exacerbated when employees deliver a controversial service such as gambling, and work in close proximity to people who gamble. Research indicates that delivery of a gambling service differs from the delivery of other recreational pursuits due to the negative personal, social, and financial impacts of gambling on problem gamblers and others. These negative costs of gambling have generated long standing ethical or moral objections within the community, and, because of the range of community views about gambling, employees who deliver gambling services are likely to be confronted with opposing community views. By interacting with patrons, employees may also question their values and attitudes to gambling, and feel concerned about those patrons who they consider may have a problem with gambling. Organisational resources that facilitate the empowerment, work attitudes and well-being of employees may exist, however, and reduce the negative effects of any gambling-related influences on employees. A mixed methods research design, consisting of two sequential phases, was used. The methods complemented each other, and minimised the disadvantages of using only one approach. A qualitative method was used in the first phase of the program to collect rich descriptions of the experiences of twenty staff working in seven Queensland clubs with gambling services in South East Queensland. The in-depth interviews helped to identify gambling-related challenges and climate-based resources of the internal and external work environments of the service organisation. The gambling-related challenges included community and media attitudes to gambling, peoples' demands on clubs, and staff beliefs about patrons who gamble. The climate-based resources included the organisational welfare of employees, expressed as meeting employees' needs for respect, developing supportive relationships with staff, encouraging open and clear communication, and the provision of social support. Organisational emphasis on quality service and meeting the needs of patrons also served as a climate-based resource for employees. The qualitative process additionally examined the impact of these factors on the empowerment, commitment and well-being of the employees, allowing the development of a conceptual model of the environmental factors of a gambling industry predicting employees' empowerment, commitment, and well-being. In the second phase of the research program, the conceptual model was tested using a cross-sectional survey. A complex, stratified, random sampling technique allowed access to a sample of clubs and participants that best represented registered and licensed clubs in Queensland. A self-administered mail questionnaire was sent to 468 employees over 41 Queensland clubs with 25 to 280 poker machines. After firstly establishing the soundness of the measurement properties of the model using confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modelling was used to test the utility of the conceptual model developed in Study 1. Overall, Study 2 supported several of the proposed links, suggesting that the conceptual model developed in Study 1 was useful for examining the salient aspects of the external and internal environments of a club that influence staff empowerment, commitment, and well-being. The study showed the role of climate-based resources in a gambling industry by indicating that those employees who had positive perceptions about employee relations, positive beliefs about patron welfare, and felt supported by their supervisors, felt more empowered, and reported higher commitment and reduced emotional exhaustion. Employee relations was the most influential construct in predicting empowerment, and indirectly affected commitment and well-being (mediated by the empowerment dimensions). Study 2 also confirmed that gambling-based challenges of the external and internal environments impacted on the empowerment and well-being of employees. Those employees who believed that the community supported gambling reported an increased sense of influence over their work environment. The employees who held positive beliefs about patrons who gamble, reinforced gambling in clubs, and attributed the causes of problems in gambling onto sources outside themselves (mostly to the patrons), reported more positive well-being. Employees who perceived that people were demanding, and were not appreciative of what clubs did for the community reported reduced meaningfulness, a reduced sense of influence over their duties and work environment, and reduced well-being.  Findings also illustrated the key role of influence, and, in particular, the meaningfulness dimension, in the empowerment, commitment, and well-being of employees in an industry delivering a gambling service.  The findings of this research have implications for managerial interventions designed to promote the empowerment, commitment and well-being of employees who deliver a gambling service. By developing and strengthening the organisational resources that facilitate the empowerment, work attitudes and well-being of employees, managers are also likely to reduce the negative effects of the demands and conflicting influences of the external and internal gambling-related challenges on employees. This research program is distinctive in that research has not previously examined the impact of internal and external challenges and resources of a gambling industry on the empowerment, work attitudes, and well-being of its employees. There has, also, been no prior research focused on the work attitudes of employees in the Queensland club industry. Future research needs to replicate the findings of the present research program. The challenges and resources that were found to affect employees in the club industry, however, may be organisation specific. There is, therefore, a need for further research that compares the impact of factors related to the delivery of a gambling service in the club industry with different gambling industries, such as the hotel and casino industries. To provide further insight into the effects of empowerment on employees' work outcomes, a performance measure, such as patron satisfaction could be included. Future studies could also examine group differences in perceptions of climate-based and gambling-related influences on the empowerment, work attitudes and well-being of employees, as a function of their occupational level. The interviews of the present research program implied that employees in different organisational positions might respond differently to both the external and internal environmental factors of the organisation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gambling</field><field name="subject">gaming</field><field name="subject">gambling industry</field><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">employee commitment</field><field name="subject">employee well-being</field><field name="subject">employee empowerment</field><field name="subject">organisational behaviour</field><field name="subject">organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">club</field><field name="subject">clubs</field><field name="subject">work environment</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041013.114742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of Couple Outcomes in Stepfamilies</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Maddie Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a program of research which aimed to identify the extent to which couple and stepfamily variables were associated with couple relationship adjustment and stability in stepfamily couples.  Two studies were conducted.  Study 1 consisted of 63 stepfamily couples who were in a committed relationship (married or cohabiting) and who had earlier taken part in an intervention program.  It was hypothesised that positive couple relationship outcomes could be predicted by low couple aggression, high couple negativity, low couple withdrawal, high parenting disagreement, and high dysfunctional parenting over a 5-year period.  The results did not support the hypotheses possibly due to low power in the design.  In Study 2, 122 stepfamily couples who been living together (married or cohabiting) as a stepfamily were assessed on couple and stepfamily factors, and these were tested for their association with couple relationship adjustment and stability, using both self-report questionnaires and interview data.  As predicted, stepfamily factors accounted for variance in couple stability above that accounted for by couple factors.  Furthermore, stepfamily factors were associated with couple stability independent of couple adjustment.  The influence of stepfamily couple relationship adjustment and stability seem distinctive from first-marriage couples.  It was concluded that stepfamily relationship education programs for stepfamilies should address the unique needs of stepfamilies such as parenting education for inexperienced stepparents, the development of positive stepparent-stepchild relationships, and the building of stepfamily cohesion.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stepfamily couples</field><field name="subject">first-marriage couples</field><field name="subject">couple relationship adjustment</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070713.140903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Police Minister and Commissioner Relationships</field><field name="creator">Pitman, Grant Alan</field><field name="description">Australian Police Ministers and Commissioners occupy a pivotal position in the system of law enforcement. Collectively, they are responsible for the general policy, administration and operational direction and control of policing through the Australian States. There has been in the past twenty five years a growing complexity and a variety of problems facing police agencies which are arduous and demanding. Continuing social tension of recent years have given police ministers and commissioners higher public profiles than ever before. The research undertaken  in this thesis examines the difficulties experienced between police ministers and commissioners in Queensland and New South Wales from 1970 to 1995. Three models have been developed as a framework to analyse the relationships and how they operate. The three models are called - 'Dependency', 'Independency' and 'Interdependency'. Twenty-one police ministers, commissioners and advisers from Queensland and New South Wales were interviewed during the course of the research. Five separate case studies were developed to analyse and interpret the relationships within the context of the three  models.  A summary chapter of additional research data  provides supporting information which was used to substantiate the case study material. The conclusion argues that relationships operate more effectively when elements of the 'Interdependency' model exist. The need for further debate about the administrative, legal and management elements of the working relationship between a police minister and commissioner is essential to achieve a balance between policy, administration and operational requirements within a modern western democratic policing system.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">police administration</field><field name="subject">police</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">police administration -- Australia</field><field name="subject">police administration -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">police -- Australia</field><field name="subject">police -- government policy</field><field name="subject">commissioner</field><field name="subject">commissioners</field><field name="subject">minister</field><field name="subject">ministers</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030228.140953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crack Spacing, Crack Width and Tension Stiffening Effect in Reinforced Concrete Beams and One-Way Slabs</field><field name="creator">Piyasena, Ratnamudigedara</field><field name="description">An analytical method for determining the crack spacing and crack width in reinforced concrete beams and one-way slabs is presented in this thesis. The locations and the distribution of cracks developed in a loaded member are predicted using the calculated concrete stress distributions near flexural cracks. To determine the stresses, a concrete block bounded by top and bottom faces and two transverse sections of the beam is isolated and analysed by the finite element method. Two types of blocks are analysed. They are: (i) block adjacent to the first flexural crack, and (ii) block in between successive cracks. The calculated concrete stress distribution adjacent to the first flexural crack is used to predict the locations of primary cracks (cracks formed at sections where the stresses have not been influenced by nearby cracks). The concrete stress distributions in between successive cracks, calculated for various crack spacings and load levels, are used to predict the formation of secondary cracks in between existing cracks. The maximum, minimum and the average crack spacing at a given load level are determined using the particular crack spacing that would produce a concrete tensile stress equal to the flexural strength of concrete. The resulting crack width at reinforcement level is determined as the relative difference in elastic extensions of steel and surrounding concrete. The accuracy of the present method is verified by comparing the predicted spacing and width of cracks with those measured by others. The analytical method presented in this thesis is subsequently used to investigate the effects of various variables on the spacing and width of cracks, and the results are presented. These results are used to select the set of parameters that has the most significant effect. A parametric study is then carried out by re-calculating the spacing and width of cracks for the selected parameters. Based on the results of this parametric study, new formulas are developed for the prediction of spacing and width of cracks. The accuracy of these formulas is ascertained by comparing the predicted values and those measured by other investigators on various types of beams under different load levels. The calculated stress distributions between successive cracks are also used to develop a new method of incorporating the tension stiffening effect in deflection calculation. First, curvature values at sections between adjacent cracks are determined under different load levels, using the concrete and steel stresses. These results are used to develop an empirical formula to determine the curvature at any section between adjacent cracks. To verify the accuracy of the new method, short-term deflections are calculated using the curvature values evaluated by the proposed formula for a number of beams, and the results are compared with those measured by others.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reinforced concrete beams</field><field name="subject">crack</field><field name="subject">cracks</field><field name="subject">cracking</field><field name="subject">one-way slabs</field><field name="subject">tension</field><field name="subject">tensioning</field><field name="subject">deflection</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030606.165418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination of the Relationship Between Personality and Citizenship Performance in Academic and Workplace Settings</field><field name="creator">Poropat, Arthur Eugene</field><field name="description">For decades, there has been substantial research showing that ability tests effectively predict what people can do, but it is only in the last fifteen years that it has come to be generally accepted that personality is a useful predictor of what they will do. Much of this change in appreciation of the role of personality in predicting performance has been attributed to the application of the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality to personality-performance research. The FFM was developed on the basis of the lexical hypothesis, which states that it is advantageous for people to be able to accurately describe the behaviour of others, and therefore the most important dimensions of personality will be encoded in natural languages. An associated premise is that natural language descriptors refer to an individual's surface appearance or reputation (i.e., their observable behaviours), rather than the underlying processes or genotype of personality (i.e., people's cognitive and affective processing). This reasoning was used as the basis for most of the factor-analytical studies of personality descriptors within the English language, and one of the most robust factor solutions was the FFM. The FFM contains the personality dimensions Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience and Emotional Stability. Although the FFM continues to evolve, particularly in response to cross-cultural research, the five basic dimensions appear to be remarkably consistent, and at least the core of each of these has been identified in the first six or seven factors found in every language considered to date. Of the five factors, Conscientiousness has been the one most reliably associated with workplace performance. Workplace performance itself has undergone a major reconsideration over the last fifteen to twenty years. Prior to that time, formal job roles and responsibilities were typically considered the start and finish of performance, but formal job requirements are now recognised as only one aspect of performance, which is increasingly referred to as Task Performance. Task Performance tends to change substantially from job to job, but there are other aspects of job performance, most notably Citizenship Performance, which appear to be consistent in most jobs. Citizenship Performance includes activities undertaken by an employee which facilitate Task Performance, such as making greater effort, complying with rules and procedures, and assisting others. Whereas Task Performance appears to be closely related to an individual's abilities, Citizenship Performance was originally proposed as an aspect of performance which is influenced by attitudinal and personality variables. Thus it has been proposed that Citizenship Performance largely mediates the relationship between personality variables, such as Conscientiousness, and Task Performance. However, this predictors of performance model has previously only been investigated in workplace settings. Yet performance is a relevant construct not only within workplace settings, but also within academic settings. In addition, the FFM dimension of Conscientiousness has been observed to be a reliable predictor of academic performance, just as it is a reliable predictor of workplace performance. Within educational settings, performance is typically tied to assessment measures, such as marks and GPA, which appear to measure academic Task Performance. However, no previous research appears to have considered whether Citizenship Performance mediates the relationship between Conscientiousness and Task Performance within an academic setting. Study One of this dissertation was designed to test this proposition. Participants in this study were 175 students enrolled within an introductory management subject. Participants provided assessments of their own personality using the Mini-Markers (Saucier, 1994), while Citizenship Performance ratings were provided by students' peers, at the end of a three-week group project. The hand-scored version of the Computerised Adaptive Rating Scales (CARS: Borman, 1999; Coleman &amp; Borman, 2000) was used to assess Citizenship, but unfortunately the three scales of the CARS did not demonstrate good internal reliability. Consequently, a factor analysis was conducted to establish a new scale using the CARS items. This new scale, which was labelled Active Support, used six of the twelve CARS items and had satisfactory internal reliability. It was observed that the resulting scores on this Citizenship Performance scale were positively correlated with both Conscientiousness and academic Task Performance (as measured by grades). As predicted, Citizenship Performance entirely mediated the relationship between Conscientiousness and academic Task Performance. Therefore, the results of Study One were consistent with the predictors of performance model. It was concluded that Citizenship Performance is an important component of performance within academic settings, just as it is within workplace settings. Despite the fact that the relationship between both workplace and academic performance, and Conscientiousness, is reliable and well-established, correlations between Conscientiousness and performance tend to be moderate at best. Previous research has observed that other-rated measures of Conscientiousness have higher correlations with academic performance than do self-rated measures. Consequently, Study Two explored whether other-rated Conscientiousness improved the prediction of academic Citizenship and Task Performance, using a similar design to that utilised in Study One. One hundred and twenty-two students participated in Study Two while undertaking the same course as the students who had participated in Study One. Most of the results of Study Two were consistent with expectations, but there were some unexpected outcomes. Other-rated Conscientiousness was found to be a significantly better predictor of both academic Task and Citizenship Performance than was self-rated Conscientiousness. However, contrary to previous ideas, the relationship between other-rated Conscientiousness and Task Performance was not mediated by Citizenship Performance. In contrast, it was observed that the correlation between other-rated Conscientiousness and other-rated Citizenship Performance was .61 if both ratings were obtained from the same raters, and .44 if the two ratings were obtained from independent raters. When corrected for measurement unreliability, these estimates approached unity, which is consistent with the idea that, for the other-raters, Conscientiousness and Citizenship Performance were measuring the same construct. However, this study had several limitations, including its small sample size, the use of an unusual measure for Citizenship Performance, and the fact that it had been conducted in an academic setting. Therefore, there was a need to replicate Study Two before accepting that Conscientiousness and Citizenship Performance are actually much more strongly associated than previous research has indicated. In order to replicate Study Two, while addressing some of its limitations, a third study was conducted within a workplace setting. In Study Three, general staff supervisors within a public university were asked to rate their staff on measures of both personality and Citizenship Performance. In addition to Active Support, the measure used in Studies One and Two, two additional measures were included, which assessed the aspects of Citizenship Performance referred to as Individual Initiative and Helping Behaviour. The FFM dimension of Agreeableness was also added, because previous research indicates that, while Conscientiousness may be a better predictor of Individual Initiative, Helping Behaviour should be more closely associated with the FFM dimension of Agreeableness. However, using multiple ratings derived from the same raters can create common method bias in correlations, and so, in line with previous recommendations (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003), Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to control for this. The resulting correlations confirmed that there were strong relationships between the measures of Citizenship Performance and personality. Helping Behaviour had a strong relationship with supervisor-rated Agreeableness (.81), while Individual Initiative was significantly correlated with supervisor-rated Agreeableness (.44) and supervisor-rated Conscientiousness (.32). Active Support had strong correlations with these measures of personality (.57 and .55 respectively). The results of Study Three indicate that, for the participating supervisors, the Helping Behaviour dimension of Citizenship Performance is largely the same as the Agreeableness dimension of personality. Unlike Study Two, Active Support appeared to be not so closely associated with Conscientiousness, but instead seemed to occupy a position halfway between other-rated Conscientiousness and other-rated Agreeableness. Individual Initiative occupies a similar position, but is not so closely linked to these other-rated personality variables. Although these results suggest that, when compared with the students in Study Two, the supervisors in Study Three had a slightly different view of Active Support, it remains clear that much or most of the variance in each of these measures of Citizenship Performance is accounted for by these other-rated measures of personality. In order to understand why the strength of the relationship between the other-rated personality dimensions of Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, and the performance construct of Citizenship Performance, has been overlooked by previous researchers, it was necessary to reconsider the basic reasons for disagreement in ratings. Agreement between raters tends to vary considerably, depending on who is rating whom. Self-other agreement on ratings is typically modest, other-other agreement tends to be higher, but alternate-form and test-retest agreement are typically higher still. The reasons for this appear to be related to the extent to which ratings are produced using similar observations, and integrating these in similar ways, as well as the extent to which ratings are affected by specific aspects of individual rater-ratee relationships. Previous research has provided estimates for these effects which can be used to correct correlations for resulting biases. When these are applied to correlations between ratings of measures, such as performance or personality, which are provided by different other-raters, these correlations approximate unity. This includes the correlations, reported in this dissertation, between other-rated personality and other-rated Citizenship Performance. In conclusion, the results of the research reported in this dissertation are consistent with the idea that measures of Citizenship Performance are largely accounted for by other-rated measures of Conscientiousness and Agreeableness. It is argued that this conclusion is consistent with the lexical hypothesis which underlay the development of the FFM, as well as with the theoretical basis for the construct of performance. The dissertation concludes with a discussion of the implications of this conclusion, for a range of fields, including understanding the relationship between personality and performance, methodological consequences for future research, and practical implications for staff selection and performance appraisal systems.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personality (five factor model)</field><field name="subject">openness to experience</field><field name="subject">emotional stability</field><field name="subject">academic performance</field><field name="subject">workplace performance</field><field name="subject">other-related conscientiousness</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060112.155434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidines: Synthesis and Structure-Activity Relationships for Binding to Adenosine Receptors</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Sally-Ann</field><field name="description">Chapter 1 of thesis is a literature review of adenosine research. The central importance of the contributions of both classical pharmacology and, more recently, molecular biology to adenosine research is demonstrated. These disciplines have enabled the classification and characterisation of adenosine receptors and as well an understanding of the physiological significance of endogenous adenosine. The significant benefits of developing therapeutics for regulation of the diverse physiological functions of adenosine, by regulation of adenosine receptors, is outlined. For this therapeutic potential to be realised both high affinity and subtype selective adenosine agonists and antagonists are required. The structure-activity relationships for agonists and xanthine antagonists are discussed. The assimilation of these structure-activity relationships have guided the development of ligand based models of the adenosine receptor pharmacophore. The 'flipped', 'N6-C8' and 'three binding domain' models were described. These models aim to direct the future design of high affinity and selective ligands for adenosine receptors. The development of receptor based models by modelling of the receptor-ligand complex is also presented. The main body of this thesis presents a study of the structure-activity relationships for pyrazolo(3,4-d) pyrimidines binding to adenosine Ai and A2a receptors. Prior to this study few non-xanthine adenosine antagonists had been well defined or optimised in terms of structure-activity relationships. However, the value of such ligands is immense, facilitating further definition of structural requirements for high affinity and selective adenosine receptor binding. These ligands should complement existing agonists and xanthine antagonists in developing an understanding of adenosine receptor binding. The experimental approach to development of the lead compound of this study, a-(6-(l'-carbamoylethylthio)- l-phenylpyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidin-4-ylthio)propanamide (5), is outlined in Chapter 2 of this thesis. 5 is substituted at C-4, C-6 and N-i of the pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine heterocycle. The experimental approach to optiniising 5 was approached in a rational manner, requiring an iterative approach i.e. design of generation I target compounds --synthesis -- biological evaluation -- structure-activity relationships -- design of generation II target compounds, etc. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 of this thesis describe this experimental approach as it relates to optimising the lead compound, 5, for adenosine receptor affinity and subtype selectivity. The importance of receptor interactions with multiple ligand domains, to achieve both potency and selectivity, was recognised so that optimisation of the C-4, C-6 and N-i substituents of the lead compound was targeted and achieved. Previous structure-activity studies with agonists and xanthine antagonists have concentrated on modifying a single ligand domain. Chapter 3 presents twelve generation I target compounds to examine C-4 and C-6 substituent structure-activity relationships. Chapter 4 presents twelve generation II target compounds to further examine C-4 and C-6 substituent structure-activity relationships. Chapter 5 presents sixteen generation ifi target compounds to examine N-I substituent structure-activity relationships. A major outcome from the research presented in these chapters was the development of highly potent and highly selective ligands for the adenosine A1 receptor subtype. a(4-Methylamino- I -phenylpyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidin-6-ylthio)hexanamide (29) was the most potent ligand at the Ai receptor identified in this study, and is one of the most potent Ai selective antagonists ever reported. 29 has an A1 K1 value of 0.745&#177;0.045 nM and is 332-fold selective for the A1 receptor over the A2a receptor. a-(1-Phenyl-4-propylthiopyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidin-6-ylthio)butanainide (27) was the most selective ligand of this study. It is four orders of magnitude selective for the A1 receptor (up to 16900-fold), and one of the most selective antagonists ever reported. This high selectivity has been achieved with the maintenance of good A1 affinity (A1 K1 = 29.5&#177;6.6 nM). These results prove the value of modifying multiple substituents of adenosine receptor ligands, generating ligands which bind with high potency and selectivity to adenosine Al receptors compared to adenosine A2a receptors.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pyrimidines</field><field name="subject">pyrazoles</field><field name="subject">adenosine receptors</field><field name="subject">pharmacology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050901.161632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal Methods For Verification Based Software Inspection</field><field name="creator">Powell, Daniel</field><field name="description">Useful processes, that are independently repeatable, are utilised in all branches of science and traditional engineering disciplines but seldom in software engineering. This is particularly so with processes used for detection and correction of defects in software systems. Code inspection, as introduced by Michael Fagan at IBM in the mid 1970's is widely recognised as an effective technique for finding defects in software. Despite its reputation, code inspection, as it is currently practiced, is not a strictly repeatable process. This is due to the problems faced by inspectors when they attempt to paraphrase the complicated semantics of a unit of computer code. Verification based software inspection, as advocated by the cleanroom software engineering community, requires that arguments of correctness be formulated with the code and its specification. These arguments rely on the reader being able to extract the semantics from the code. This thesis addresses the requirement for an independently repeatable, scalable and substantially automated method for yielding semantics from computer code in a complete, unambiguous and consistent manner in order to facilitate, and make repeatable, verification based code inspection. Current literature regarding the use of code inspection for verification of software is surveyed. Empirical studies are referenced, comparing inspection to software testing and program proof. Current uses of formal methods in software engineering will be discussed, with particular reference to formal method applications in verification. Forming the basis of the presented method is a systematic, and hence repeatable, approach to the derivation of program semantics. The theories and techniques proposed for deriving semantics from program code extend current algorithmic and heuristic techniques for deriving invariants. Additionally, the techniques introduced yield weaker forms of invariant information which are also useful for verification, defect detection and correction. Methods for using these weaker invariant forms, and tools to support these methods, are introduced. Algorithmic and heuristic techniques for investigating loop progress and termination are also introduced. Some of these techniques have been automated in supporting tools, and hence, the resulting defects can be repeatably identified. Throughout this thesis a strong emphasis is placed on describing implementable algorithms to realise the derivation techniques discussed. A number of these algorithms are implemented in a tool to support the application of the verification methods presented. The techniques and tools presented in this thesis are well suited, but not limited to, supporting rigorous methods of defect detection as well as formal and semi-formal reasoning of correctness. The automation of these techniques in tools to support practical, formal code reading and correctness argument will assist in addressing the needs of trusted component technologies and the general requirement for quality in software.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">software verification</field><field name="subject">verification-based software inspection</field><field name="subject">code inspection</field><field name="subject">software defects</field><field name="subject">defective software</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030925.154706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fabrication of Micro-Mirrors in Silicon Optical Waveguides</field><field name="creator">Powell, Olly</field><field name="description">The conventional large radii bends used in large cross section silicon-on-insulator waveguides were replaced with novel wet etched corner mirrors, potentially allowing much smaller devices, therefore lower costs. If such corners had been based on reactive ion etch techniques they would have had the disadvantage of rougher surfaces and poor alignment in the vertical direction. Wet etching overcomes these two problems by providing smooth corner facets aligned precisely to the vertical {100} silicon crystallographic planes. The waveguides obtained had angled walls, and so numerical analysis was undertaken to establish the single mode condition for such trapezoidal structures. To show the relationship between fabrication tolerances and optical losses a three dimensional simulation tool was developed, based on expansion of the incident mode into plane waves. Various new fabrication techniques were are proposed, namely: the use of titanium as a mask for deep silicon wet anisotropic etching, a technique for aligning masks to the crystal plane on silicon-oninsulator wafers, a corner compensation method for sloping sidewalls, and the suppression of residues and pyramids with the use of acetic acid for KOH etching. Also, it was shown that isopropyl alcohol may be used in KOH etching of vertical walls if the concentration and temperature are sufficiently high. As the proposed corner mirrors were convex structures the problem of undercutting by high order crystal planes arose. This was uniquely overcome by the addition of some structures to effectively convert the convex structures into concave ones. The corner mirrors had higher optical losses than were originally hoped for, similar to those of mirrors in thin film waveguides made by RIE. The losses were possibly due to poor angular precision of the lithography process. The design also failed to provide adequate mechanisms to allow the etch to be stopped at the optimal time. The waveguides had the advantage over thin film technology of large, fibre-compatible cross sections. However the mirror losses must be reduced for the technology to compete with existing large cross section waveguides using large bends. Potential applications of the technology are also discussed. The geometry of the crystal planes places fundamental limits on the proximity of any two waveguides. This causes some increase in the length of MMI couplers used for channel splitting. The problem could possibly be overcome by integrating one of the mirrors into the end of the MMI coupler to form an L shaped junction.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silicon-on-insulator waveguides</field><field name="subject">silicon optical waveguides</field><field name="subject">micro-mirrors</field><field name="subject">wet etching</field><field name="subject">reactive ion etching</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040719.115224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origin of Dioxins in Queensland: Investigations into the Distribution and Sources of Polychlorinated Dibenzo-P-Dioxins in the Queensland Terrestrial Environment</field><field name="creator">Prange, Joelle</field><field name="description">Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) are persistent organic pollutants of global concern as they are persistent, toxic and can biomagnify through the food chain. PCDD/Fs are generally regarded as trace contaminants in a number of chemical products and they are formed as by-products from various industrial, chemical and combustion processes. The pollution with PCDD/Fs occurs with the release of these chemicals into the environment, resulting in the contamination of various compartments including; air, soil, sediment and biota. Studies that have investigated the distribution of PCDD/Fs in the environment suggest that the highest concentrations of these pollutants are found in locations with a history of industrial or chemical PCDD/F sources. Queensland is the north-eastern state of Australia. Queensland has a low population density, few industrial activities and is considered predominantly rural. Therefore it was somewhat surprising that elevated concentrations of PCDD/Fs (in particular the higher chlorinated PCDDs) have been observed in soil and sediments samples collected from various locations along the Queensland coast. The concentrations of PCDDs in Queensland samples were comparable to or higher than concentrations in similar matrices from highly polluted regions elsewhere. To investigate the origin of PCDDs in Queensland, the geographical distribution of PCDD/Fs in topsoil was investigated in the coastal and inland environments to provide information on the potential sources and to estimate the extent of the PCDD contamination. Distinct east-west gradients were detected in topsoil collected from bushland areas across the state with elevated PCDD concentrations confined to the coastal region. Within the coastal region, the contamination could not be associated with specific land uses. In fact, the PCDD/F congener profile was similar in the majority of samples from the coastal region, with a dominance of the higher chlorinated PCDDs (in particular OCDD), whereas PCDFs were low or below the limit of detection. The similarity in the PCDD/F congener profiles in the soils along the coastal region indicated that a source of PCDDs of similar origin has resulted in the contamination of soil extending more than 3000 km and estimations suggest that more than 50 tonnes of OCDD is stored in the topsoil of Queensland.s coastal region. Investigation into the vertical distribution of PCDDs in Queensland coastal soils revealed elevated concentrations of PCDDs, (in particular OCDD) in soils to at least 3.5 m. These results indicated that the extent of the PCDD contamination is significantly greater than anticipated and it was estimated that there is in the order of 3 000 tonnes of OCDD stored in Queensland's coastal soils. The specific PCDD/F congener profile in Queensland coastal soils is unlike known PCDD/F source profiles which led to the suggestion that some yet unidentified formation mechanism may have resulted in the contamination. Potential natural sources of PCDD/Fs, including forest fires, geogenic and biogenic processes were assessed as possible origins for the PCDD contamination in Queensland. Elevated concentrations of PCDDs were detected in the atmosphere during a 'prescribed burn'. This study demonstrated that although forest fires influence atmospheric PCDD/F concentrations substantially, forest fires are not the source of PCDDs in Queensland; rather they are an important mechanism for the redistribution of PCDDs and may have attributed to the widespread PCDD contamination. In this study geological materials (oil shale and kaolin) were analysed as a proxy to assess a geogenic origin of PCDDs. Elevated concentrations of PCDDs were observed in the kaolin samples, however similar and higher concentrations were detected in surface and sub-surface soils, suggesting that specific geogenic formation processes investigated are not the source of PCDDs in Queensland. A preliminary indication for a biogenic origin of PCDDs was identified during the anaerobic incubation of sugarcane irrigation sediments. An increase in the concentration of OCDD in the anaerobic treatment, compared to the control was observed after incubation for 90 days. In these same experiments, a dechlorination of OCDD to lower chlorinated (1,4,6,9-substituted) PCDDs was also observed. Similar transformation processes were observed in other anaerobic environments in Queensland, which led to the suggestion that a biogenic formation of PCDDs (possibly from a precursor) may be responsible for the origin of PCDDs in Queensland.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins</field><field name="subject">dioxins</field><field name="subject">dioxin</field><field name="subject">polychlorinated dibenzofurans</field><field name="subject">pollution</field><field name="subject">pollutants</field><field name="subject">PCCD</field><field name="subject">PCCDs</field><field name="subject">PCDF</field><field name="subject">PCDFs</field><field name="subject">soil pollution</field><field name="subject">soil contamination</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040615.161651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Commonwealth Public Inquiries</field><field name="creator">Prasser, Gavin Scott</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the extent and use of public inquiries appointed by the Commonwealth government since federation. Given the increased incidence in public inquiries since the 1970s, particular attention is given to assessing inquiries during this period. The thesis develops a clear definition of public inquiries to better identify the number established and to distinguish them from other advisory institutions and to allow more accurate comparison of their use by different governments over extended timeframes. The thesis addresses a number of key issues concerning public inquiries such as the reasons for their appointment, their roles and functions in the political system, their powers of investigation, processes of operation, their different organisational forms and their impact on policy development. In addition, the thesis seeks to explain both the long term use of public inquiries in Australia, and in particular their increased incidence since the 1970s. Supported by new data, and a more rigorous definition of public inquiries, the thesis identifies trends in the number and type of public inquiries appointed, their use by different governments, the range of issues investigated, the processes employed and the changing composition of their memberships. The thesis proposes that an important means of explaining the continuing appointment of inquiries is their intrinsic 'publicness' - their public appointment, external membership, temporary nature, open processes, and public reporting arrangements. This 'publicness' has given public inquiries a particular standing and legitimacy in the political system that for a variety of reasons, other institutions are increasingly unable to provide. Other issues concerning public inquiry appointment such as the effect of government partisanship, the impact of the electoral cycle, and the political motivations of governments are also assessed. A number of theories such as public choice are examined in relation to explaining inquiry appointment and found to have limited application in providing an overall explanation of inquiry use and their functions. These different issues are analysed by examination of many individual inquiries and supplemented by in depth assessment of three clusters of case studies. The case studies cover seven inquiries of different types and powers appointed over a twenty year period by both Labor and Coalition governments into a range of different fields including public sector reform, allegations of corruption and maladministration and financial deregulation. Each set of case studies examines why the inquiries were appointed, their classification and type, the processes employed, the form and content of their reports, and their policy impact. The thesis concludes that in examining why public inquiries are appointed and their roles in the political system, they need to be assessed not just by the effectiveness of their processes or the quality of their advice.  These are important, but alone are not sufficient in explaining the persistent use of inquiries by all governments and their proliferation since the 1970s. The thesis contends that it is the 'publicness' of inquiries which distinguishes them from other advisory bodies and gives inquiries particular standing in the Australian political system to be perceived to be able to legitimately investigate and advise on a wide of issues. Despite the growth of other advisory bodies in recent times, public inquiries have continued to be appointed in increasing numbers since the early 1970s regardless of the government in power and therefore need to be seen less as an aberration of the Australian political system and more as an important, if often understudied, component. Future research areas recommended include the need for greater comparative analysis of their use with other Westminster democracies such as the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public enquiries</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Government enquiries</field><field name="subject">government partisanship</field><field name="subject">Australian political system</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060811.160901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into Faecal Sterols and E.Coli as Indicators of Sewage and Non-Sewage Inputs into a Subtropical Estuarine Embayment System in South Eastern QLD, Australia</field><field name="creator">Pratt, Catherine</field><field name="description">Sewage pollution from humans, animal and domestic sources (land and agricultural run-off) are recognized as a major cause of deteriorating water quality along Australia's coastline. Management of water quality has primarily relied on the use of bacterial indicator methods. However the validity and source-specificity of these methods have been met with increasing reservations for several years now. A relatively recent methodology uses a different chemical biomarker approach using 'sterols', a group of compounds related to the common bio-membrane lipid cholesterol and its derivatives.  Sterols can offer an additional diagnostic tool to distinguish and discriminate between sources of faecal contamination in marine, freshwater and estuarine environments in both sediments and the water column. This study investigates for the first time, the degradation of coprostanol and selected faecal sterols in 'natural' sediments from a highly mixed (marine and estuarine) sub-tropical environment following a simulated pollution event (primary effluent); the use of faecal sterols as an additional indicator for determining non-point source sewage discharges at popular anchorages in the Moreton Bay and Gold Coast Broadwater system; and the use of sterol ratios in the determination of the fate and transportation of nutrients from a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) point-source outlet pipe during plant malfunction. The microcosm degradation experiment revealed that faecal and selected sterols are continually synthesised and degraded over time by auto- and hetero trophic organisms within the sediment matrix. Coprostanol was the only sterol to degrade continually, with only minor fluctuations over a time period of two months. Results from this degradation experiment further revealed a sharp decline of coprostanol within the first week. From this it could be concluded that, without any further addition, external inputs of coprostanol are reduced to background levels within this time period. Therefore, removal of coprostanol after six days was 94% and 73% in mud and sand, respectively. The removal of coprostanol was much higher in mud than sand, reflecting a higher level of microbial activity in muddy sediments for assimilation of sterols. The field study undertaken at popular anchorages in Moreton Bay and the Gold Coast Broadwater revealed extremely low levels of sterols and bacterial indicators over both a spatial and temporal scale consistent with a shallow, oligotrophic, highly dynamic sand dominated system. Even though sterols analysed were found at extremely low levels (mostly in the nano-gram range), they were found to be highly correlated and were successful in identifying an unexpected once off pollution event from a point source at Moreton Bay Island. Other than this one incident, both sterol and bacterial levels were consistently low even when anchorages were at full capacity. Thus, sewage from recreational vessels was found to have very little, if any, effect on the water quality at anchorages in Moreton Bay and Gold Coast Broadwater. The point-source study conducted during a local sewage treatment plant malfunction revealed that even though absolute concentrations of sterols did not change during this event, the distribution of sterols within the samples changed, hence changing the sterol ratios. Further, nutrients (mainly nitrogen) can be transported several kilometres by currents, flocculate out of the water column and settle out into the sediment in areas with low tidal and hydrological flushing. There, the nutrients can cause in situ production of sterols in sediments changing sterol ratios. Overall, this study revealed that analyses of sterol biomarkers have the potential to indicate nutrient inputs (such as nitrogen) as well as sewage, post-hoc pollution events at extremely low levels/high dilutions in coastal sediments.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sewage pollution</field><field name="subject">faecol sterols</field><field name="subject">E.coli</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">estuarine embayment</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070124.111827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retrodictive Quantum State Engineering</field><field name="creator">Pregnell, Kenneth Lyell</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with retrodiction and measurement in quantum optics. The latter of these two concepts is studied in particular form with a general optical multiport device, consisting of an arbitrary array of beam-splitters and phase-shifters. I show how such an apparatus generalizes the original projection synthesis technique, introduced as an in principle technique to measure the canonical phase distribution. Just as for the original projection synthesis, it is found that such a generalised device can synthesize any general projection onto a state in a finite dimensional Hilbert space. One of the important findings of this thesis is that, unlike the original projection synthesis technique, the general apparatus described here only requires a classical, that is a coherent, reference field at the input of the device. Such an apparatus lends itself much more readily to practical implementation and would find applications in measurement and predictive state engineering. If we relax the above condition to allow for just a single non-classical reference field, we show that the apparatus is capable of producing a single-shot measure of canonical phase. That is, the apparatus can project onto any one of an arbitrarily large subset of phase eigenstates, with a probability proportional to the overlap of the phase state and the input field. Unlike the original projection synthesis proposal, this proposal requires a binomial reference state as opposed to a reciprocal binomial state. We find that such a reference state can be obtained, to an excellent approximation, from a suitably squeezed state. The analysis of these measurement apparatuses is performed in the less usual, but completely rigorous, retrodictive formalism of quantum mechanics.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum optics</field><field name="subject">quantum mechanics</field><field name="subject">retrodiction</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041029.134933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ideology and Narrative Realism : a Critique of Post-Althusserian Anti-Realism</field><field name="creator">Prenzler, Timothy James</field><field name="description">This thesis defends the potential of the &#145;realist&#146; form of narrative for contesting, as well as reproducing, ideology. The common form of &#145;realism&#146; consists of a loose ensemble of conventions. The key components are omniscient, evaluative narration; an empiricist objectivism; the construction of individuals as agents of action and bearers of natural attributes; cause and effect sequencing; conflict leading to resolution; mystery leading to disclosure; and the effacement of these techniques in the interests of illusion. In one critique of realism &#150; &#145;post-Althusserian anti-realism&#146; - these practices constitute ideology both in a general sense - as manipulation - and a specific sense - as transmitters of capitalist presuppositions. A 'social realism' or &#145;critical realism&#146;, which attempts to invalidate ideology by the presentation of countervailing data, is said to be undercut by its encoding within this alleged inherently ideological form. This critique of realism is based on an unsustainable, &#145;formalist&#146;, reduction of &#145;content&#146; to &#145;form&#146;. The role of observation in knowledge production and the significance of inductively generated propositions are replaced by a sophisticated, but ultimately reductive, &#145;discursive determinism&#146;. From its conventionalist epistemological premises, post-Althusserian anti-realism ignores the capacity of empiricism to break with preconceptions. By dismissing the convention of accountability to evidence, the critique is forced back onto criteria of internal consistency - a position even more vulnerable to prejudice than empiricism. The thesis then argues that the concomitant view of the subject of narrative realism as a construct of liberal-individualism ignores how realist texts have questioned ideas of autonomy and a fixed human nature. Anti-realist methods have usefully exposed some of the means by which constructions of freedom and self-determination mask the subordination of labour in &#145;free&#146; -market economies. However, this frequently entails undervaluing gains made under a rubric of human rights. The replacement of human subjectivity with discursive or economic determinism tends to expel dialogue, volition and human needs as factors in the ideational and practical repudiation of ideology. A narrow approach to realism is therefore inadequate for determining the relation of realism to ideology. The alternative position defended here is that realism&#146;s relation to capitalism - like that of liberalism and empiricism - is tangential, not homologous. The variability of &#145;content&#146; in realism makes realist techniques - as abstract form - politically neutral (but claimed by anti-realists to be intrinsically authoritarian). Realist conventions which construct a point of view are open options for making judgements that will vary in empirical rigour and opposition to different ideologies. The thesis sets the authoritarian aspects of realism&#146;s attempted manipulation of the reader against the potential in realism for a dialogic plurality of perspectives, the possible defensibility of a point of view, the need for coherence and judgement in political dialogue and action, and the frequency of &#145;content&#146;-based reader resistance. The realist form is not an absolute of representation, but nor is it a mere reflex of capitalism. By the same token, the anti-realist concept of the anti-ideological function of &#145;anti-realist&#146; texts imposes a reverse, homogeneous, inherently oppositional role onto politically heterogenous cultural forms. The thesis argues, furthermore, that by rejecting empiricist modes of substantiation and adopting a mechanistic view of ideology, the post-Althusserian critique of realism fails to engage adequately with the theoretical defence of capitalism. The harmony thesis of free enterprise can only be given a pejorative label &#145;ideology&#146; on the basis of comparative and historical considerations of the performance of capitalism. In practice, the natural tendency of the market to cyclical instability with attendant unemployment, impoverishment and the compounding of class-based inequalities has only been mitigated by extensive government intervention. The thesis concludes then with a case study of Dickens&#146;s Hard Times as an example of the above, more effective, approach to capitalist legitimation. Hard Times employs empiricist, semi-&#145;fictional&#146;, &#145;realist&#146; techniques to demonstrate the ideological nature of theories of free enterprise. The critical edge of this novel is blunted by a liberal-romanticism that is ambivalent about legal-institutional solutions to social problems. Despite this fault, Hard Times shows some of the possibilities offered by the realist form for viable social critique.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Realism</field><field name="subject">narrative</field><field name="subject">post-Althusserian anti-realism</field><field name="subject">empiricism</field><field name="subject">capitalism</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051116.101351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil Erosion Studies on Steep Slopes of Humid-Tropic Philippines</field><field name="creator">Presbitero, Alan Ludovice</field><field name="description">An in-situ water-induced soil erosion study of two years duration was conducted at a low slope of about 10%, and also on steep slopes of about 50%, 60% and 70% at the experimental site located at a soil and water research area contiguous to the Department of Agricultural Engineering and Applied Mathematics of the Visayas State College of Agriculture (ViSCA). ViSCA is located in the town of Baybay at the island of Leyte in humid tropical Philippines (latitude of 10 degrees 44' north and longitude of 124 degrees 48' east). The study has the following aims, namely: 1) to investigate the effect of local farming practices on soil erosion, particularly at steep slopes; 2) to study the hydrology and soil erosion processes in steep slope conditions in humid tropical climate; and 3) to apply and determine the limitations of a physical process-oriented sediment transport model for water-induced soil erosion model (Griffith University Erosion System Template, GUEST) to a very permeable soil under very high rainfall conditions. In the context of the steep slope experiments at ViSCA: a) across the slope planting of corn is equally effective in controlling soil loss as hedged farming alone or in combination with peanut intercrop; b) across the slope planting of corn in hedged runoff plots is as effective in controlling soil loss as when combined with peanut intercrop; c) farmer&#146;s practice of planting a rowcrop like corn along the slope (providing ready-made downslope pathways for runoff water thus, encouraging flow-driven soil erosion) produces significant soil loss, often larger than from a bare runoff plot; d) hedgerows significantly reduced sediment concentration provided they remain intact; e) "failure" in hedgerows, often results in massive soil loss, being even greater than that in a comparable bare runoff plot. (Failure is manifested by runoff breaching the litter barrier at the base of the hedgerow in a localized position, leading to concentrated flow and extension of rills upslope from base of hedgerow) of hedged runoff plot (even though contour planted) and f) application of stubble in combination with across slope planting in hedged runoff plots (with or without a closely growing intercrop) provided both maximum surface cover (aerial and contact)  and protection against soil loss in steep slopes. These conclusions are likely to apply to crops similar to corn, with an intercrop similar to peanut in morphology and root system. These conclusions might also be expected to apply to low slopes, though the effect of such protection might not be as pronounced as in steep slope runoff plots. Soil erosion mechanisms in steep slopes are dominated mainly by the runoff-driven processes of entrainment and re-entrainment. Average sediment concentration c and total soil loss M are shown to be functions of positive coefficient runoff related regressors and a parameter that measures rills formed and permanently imprinted on soil surface, and of negative coefficient regressors related to surface contact cover, at least for the steep slopes considered in this study. The relatively high streampower associated with overland flow on steep slopes suggests that overland flow dominates over rainfall impact as a source of soil sediment concentration. This was confirmed by the low value of the measured ratio of soil sediment concentration shed by net-rainfall detachment trays to that lost from the bare runoff plots. On the effect of surface contact cover on average sediment concentration c, the following findings were made, namely: a) surface contact cover of only about 20% to 30% is sufficient to reduce c to low levels, assuming the cover is well distributed; b) an "exponential-decay" form of relationship existed between surface contact cover and the average sediment concentration from the non-bare soil without normalizing with respect to sediment concentration from a reference bare soil runoff plot; and c) such nonlinear relationship is indicative of the dominating runoff processes of entrainment and re-entrainment compared to the linear form of relationships if rainfall &#150;driven processes of detachment and re-detachment dominate. In runoff dominated soil erosion processes, surface contact cover (including both living and dead vegetative cover close enough to the soil surface to impede overland flow) is more significant in curtailing soil erosion than aerial surface cover. ...continued.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil erosion</field><field name="subject">slope</field><field name="subject">slopes</field><field name="subject">sloping</field><field name="subject">hill</field><field name="subject">hills</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040906.151808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of Strategic Learners: A Study of Teaching and Learning</field><field name="creator">Price, Nancy L</field><field name="description">This thesis study set as its objective to investigate the effect of a comprehensive intervention to develop strategic learners on participating teachers and students. The intervention, named CORE Program for Strategic Teaching and Learning, was implemented throughout the entire curriculum by every teacher in Grades 7 - 12 in the Classical School. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methodology was used for the study. Grade 7 students were chosen for research purposes. Teacher participants included both certified and non-certified individuals, all with degrees in their area of instruction, whose experience ranged from none to decades. The student population was atypical, as it was composed of very highly-achieving and above average students in a private school. A review of the literature was made in an attempt to determine the critical elements of strategic learning and the necessary components for a successful intervention. Metacognition, self-regulation, self-efficacy, attribution for success, learning goal orientation, motivation, volitional control, and learning strategies were found to be interactive processes within strategic learning. Borrowing from chaos theory, strategic learning was viewed as a complex web of interacting influences, from which one could not extract a particular element to examine. Therefore, the study attempted to implement an intervention that would affect all of the above-named skills and attitudes exemplified by strategic learners. Teachers involved accepted the intervention and utilized it within their teaching, showing progress in ease of inclusion with years of experience in the program. The study data showed that the intervention had a generally positive student learning effect on 17 out of 21 items surveyed, with statistical significance determined for five items. The intervention was equally effective with very high-achieving students as well as with the lowest achieving students in the population studied.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic learners</field><field name="subject">CORE Program for Strategic Teaching and Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070315.105718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Checking Out Supermarket Labour Usage: The Nature of Labour Usage and Employment Relations Consequences in a Food Retail Firm in Australia</field><field name="creator">Price, Robin Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the nature of labour usage within a market-leading Australian food retail firm and the employment relations consequences of the labour usage strategies employed by the firm. Retail employment is well established as a research subject in the UK, but has received comparatively little research attention in Australia. Given that retail industry employment accounts for 15 per cent of the Australian workforce, this represents a significant oversight. Within the retail industry, the supermarket and grocery sector employs 6 per cent of the Australian workforce. The sector is dominated by two major chains and is highly competitive, with a reputation for low profit margins, mundane jobs and low pay. The sector is recognised for an employment structure that is segmented with one segment holding full-time jobs with core employment conditions and the other segment, part-time jobs with poor working conditions. The dominant theory used by scholars to explain this employment structure is the dual labour market model and later iterations such as Atkinson's flexible firm model. This research assesses the value of these models, in particular Atkinson's flexible firm model, as a representation of the labour usage strategies of a market-leading Australian food retail firm. This analysis demonstrates that, in a general sense, Atkinson's model has applicability to the labour usage strategies exhibited in food retailing. The research found that, contrary to the theories of dual labour markets, a strong internal labour market operated within the firm with short hours casual employment as the port of entry. The benefits of this practice for the organisation were flexibility in labour usage and substantial wage savings, while the negative consequences were recruitment difficulties, exacerbated by high levels of staff turnover. For the employees, the consequences depended on their position in the organisational hierarchy and their individual circumstances, but involved initially accepting limited working hours and low pay in order to gain entry into the organisation. The research undertaken for this thesis leads to the development of a revised model, the casual internal labour market model, which more accurately depicts the labour usage strategies within the case study organisation. Retail researchers argue that it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the industry in order to understand the structure of labour usage. Additionally, employment relations and retail researchers both stress the need to contextualise labour usage patterns within broader environmental constraints and supply side factors. In seeking to achieve this, this research examines business strategies, retail specific employment relations literature and the Australian employment relations context. Furthermore, this study addresses the issue of retail employment strategies at several levels within one of Australia's market-leading food retailers: corporate level, store level and at the level of individual departments within the store. In doing so, this thesis highlights the differences in labour usage between stores and between departments within the stores and thereby provides a more detailed picture of the labour use practices within food retailers.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">labor</field><field name="subject">labour</field><field name="subject">empoyment relations</field><field name="subject">employee relations</field><field name="subject">workplace relations</field><field name="subject">supermarket</field><field name="subject">supermarkets</field><field name="subject">grocery stores</field><field name="subject">grocery retail</field><field name="subject">food retail</field><field name="subject">food retailing</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040809.154443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Longitudinal Evaluation of a Theoretically Derived Adolescent Career Education Intervention</field><field name="creator">Prideaux, Lee-Ann</field><field name="description">Theoretically derived career education programs are not well documented in the career development literature. This remains so, despite growing recognition of the negative effects of a schism between theory and practice. This thesis describes a research project that attempted to incorporate theory into practice. The two primary aims were to  test and extend career development theory, and to evaluate a theoretically derived career education program. The participants were 296 Year 10 students (mean age = 14.5 years; 147 females &amp; 149 males) attending a government high school in a low socio-economic area of a large Australian city. Career maturity, career decision-making self-efficacy, and career indecision were the key career development variables examined. Students' decision coping patterns were also investigated.  There were three studies in all. The first gathered qualitative data from a stratified random sample (N = 30) of staff and parents at the school where the research took place. This study assessed the career decision-making development needs of the students. It also provided context specific information about the opportunity structure of these adolescents, including perceived barriers to making sound career-related decisions. Findings centred upon the belief that students lacked self confidence and were in need of training in life skills generally, and decision-making and goal setting skills in particular. The interviewees also painted a grim picture about students' complacency and sense of resignation to unemployment.  The second study involved the cross-sectional examination of baseline survey data, which obtained measures of the career development variables under investigation as well as relevant demographic and contextual data including part-time work experience, school achievement level, and parents' education and employment status. A thorough review of the career development literature, combined with the qualitative data, and the findings of this cross-sectional study, served to guide the design of a career education intervention. Social cognitive career theory's choice model (Lent, Brown, &amp; Hackett, 1994) was used as the framework for the career education intervention, which ran for six weeks with one 70 minute lesson per week. Relationships amongst the key variables established previously in the literature were reflected in the results of the cross-sectional study. Demographic and contextual variables were also found to impact upon students' level of career development and decision-making behaviour in anticipated ways.  The third study was a longitudinal assessment of the intervention using the baseline survey and three more surveys administered during the same school year. The short and long term effects of the intervention were examined according to mode of delivery, and comparisons were made with controls. The researcher was the career development "expert" facilitator for the implementation of the intervention to 134 students between the first and second testing times. A wait-listed control group of 118 students undertook the intervention between the second and third testing times with regular classroom teachers facilitating it. The remaining students were enrolled in a generic school-based vocational course and were not given the intervention. There was a lapse of eight weeks between each of the first three testing times with the fourth test taken 12 weeks later.   Despite its brief nature, the intervention was found to assist students' career development in a variety of ways. It led to gains in career maturity for females regardless of who taught them.  However, males' career maturity was enhanced only if teachers facilitated the intervention. Levels of career indecision and maladaptive decision-making coping patterns were also reduced by the intervention with teacher facilitation. A matched sample of students who did the intervention exhibited significantly better outcomes than those doing the generic vocational course. The long term impact of the intervention was found to be generally beneficial, although some gains were not maintained 12 weeks later. Students' career decision-making self-efficacy and their resoluteness toward decision-making were not affected by the intervention.  The research findings led to an appeal for the realignment of focus in career education. This has implications for career education curriculum development in Australia, which needs to shift from its ad hoc, information giving approach, to more comprehensive, long-term, and intensive programming. Career education that enhances the personal skills students need to meet the demands of the world of work in the twenty-first century is required. Career process skills are of paramount importance. Specialist training for career guidance officers is also recommended and more research incorporating theory and practice is advocated.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">career education programs</field><field name="subject">vocational education progams</field><field name="subject">careers</field><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="subject">teenagers</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">career choice</field><field name="subject">career decision-making</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">interventions</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040701.093444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career Development and Adolescents Who are Hard of Hearing: Career Maturity, Career Decision-Making and Career Barriers Among High School Students in Regular Classes</field><field name="creator">Punch, Renee J</field><field name="description">In Australia, as in most English-speaking countries, increasing numbers of children with significant hearing loss are being educated in regular classes with the support of itinerant teachers of the deaf, rather than in segregated settings. These students primarily use their amplified residual hearing and communicate orally, and may be functionally defined as hard of hearing. This thesis reports on a study investigating the career development of hard of hearing high school students attending regular Year 10, 11, and 12 classes with itinerant teacher support in the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales. The students had bilateral sensorineural hearing losses ranging from mild to profound. The study sought to identify and analyse the key factors that influence the career development of this population. The design of the study was informed by Social Cognitive Career Theory (Lent, Brown, &amp; Hackett, 1994), with its emphasis on cognitive variables, personal agency, diversity, and contextual influences, and the developmental theory of Donald Super and its associated concept of career maturity (Super, 1980; Super, Savickas, &amp; Super, 1996). The study also investigated the social participation of hard of hearing adolescents and the relationship among the students' perceptions of their social participation, their social self-concept, and their career decision-making. The research was conducted using a three-phase, mixed methods approach incorporating two major phases, one quantitative and one qualitative, preceded by a minor, preliminary phase. The preliminary, exploratory phase of the study was included in order to guide the design of the survey instrument, and in particular the section covering perceived career barriers, an area not discussed in the literature for this population. Interviews were conducted with four hard of hearing Year 12 school students and four hard of hearing first-year university students who were recent school-leavers. In phase two, sixty-five hard of hearing students were compared with a matched group of normally hearing peers on measures of career maturity, career indecision, perceived career barriers, social participation and three variables associated with Social Cognitive Career Theory: career decision-making self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and goals. In addition, predictors of career maturity were tested for both groups. Phase three comprised the collection and analysis of qualitative data from interviews with a proportion of the survey respondents to explore the quantitative results in greater depth. Twelve students with hearing losses ranging from moderate to profound participated in these interviews. Results of the quantitative analysis indicated that (a) the two groups did not differ on measures of career maturity or social participation, (b) the Social Cognitive Career Theory variables were less predictive of career behaviours for the hard of hearing students than for the normally hearing students, and (c) perceived career barriers related to hearing loss predicted lower scores on the measure of career development attitudes for the hard of hearing students. The quantitative data also showed that survey respondents reported high levels of anticipation of some hearing-related barriers to achieving their educational or career goals, particularly 'people not understanding my hearing loss.' The results of the qualitative analysis extended many of the quantitative findings, yielding information and insights inaccessible through traditional quantitative methods. The qualitative findings revealed ways in which students perceived potential barriers, how they felt about them, and ways in which their perceptions of barriers influenced their career choice and decision-making. In addition, the qualitative findings revealed a complex interaction among students' social participation with their peers, their experiences of other people's negative reactions, their self-consciousness about their hearing loss, their fears about mishearing people, and their career decision-making. In sum, the study identified potential career barriers as a key factor influencing the career development of this group of hard of hearing students, and clarified understanding of the way in which their social self-concept interacted with their career development. The study's findings contribute to current knowledge and understanding of the career development of adolescents with significant hearing loss who attend regular classes with itinerant teacher support in two states of Australia. The thesis discusses implications for theory and for practice that have arisen from the study, and sets out recommendations for ways in which the career development and transition of this population might be improved.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hearing impaired</field><field name="subject">Australian secondary students</field><field name="subject">career choices for hearing impaired</field><field name="subject">career decion-making</field><field name="subject">career barriers</field><field name="subject">teaching the hearing impaired</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060608.124321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective Synthetic Modification of Aminoglycosides for Drug Targeting to Tuberculosis</field><field name="creator">Quader, Sabina</field><field name="description">The work presented in this thesis details the synthetic modification of the clinically important aminoglycoside antibiotics, neomycin B, paromomycin and tobramycin. We sought to modify aminoglycosides by attaching lipophilic groups, including fatty acids and steroids, with a view to improving the bacterial membrane permeability of these species, and ultimately their efficacy in the treatment of tuberculosis.  Our initial synthetic strategy involved direct and specific functionalization of the singular primary hydroxyl group of the aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin B, with lipophilic groups containing carboxylic acid functions via Mitsunobu esterification.  Although, direct and selective Mitsunobu acylation of the primary hydroxyl group proved unsuccessful in the case of the pseudo tetrasaccharide neomycin B, the Mitsunobu reaction did however result in selective chemistry elsewhere in the molecule and this has been exploited for modification of the ido (ring IV) and streptamine (ring II) ring systems. Under carefully controlled conditions, the Mitsunobu reaction has been used for the selective dehydration of the ido ring, to give the talo epoxide, and, under more forcing Mitsunobu dehydration conditions, an aziridine function has been introduced into the streptamine moiety. Both the epoxide and the epoxide-aziridine neomycin building blocks were utilized as synthons in subsequent chemical transformations. Seventeen novel neomycin derivatives featuring modification of ring IV and/or ring II were obtained using this approach. Explicit structural elucidation of all the synthetic intermediates and the final products was achieved using high temperature NMR spectroscopy. Direct and specific functionalization of the singular primary hydroxyl group at the C5 position of the ribose ring (ring III) of neomycin B was achieved, via a procedure based in part on selective tripsylation of the C5III primary hydroxyl group of neomycin B reported previously, followed by subsequent displacement of the tripsyl group by azide. Terminal alkyne containing lipophilic esters were then successfully attached to the ribose residue of neomycin B via Cu(I)-mediated azide-alkyne coupling reaction. In addition to the isolation of two fortuitous, new and versatile synthons i.e. monoanhydro neomycin and bis-anhydro neomycin for modification of ring IV and ring II of neomycin, a third synthon based on neomycin framework, allowing stepwise modification of ring III and ring IV was designed and synthesized. This synthon features an epoxide function in the ido ring, and a protected amine function at the C5 position of the ribose ring. Examples of the stepwise use of this synthon for further synthetic modification of the neomycin framework were demonstrated. Fourteen novel neomycin derivatives featuring modification of ring III and /or ring IV were obtained and characterized. Regioselective Mitsunobu esterification of the single primary hydroxyl group of the pseudo trisaccharide tobramycin was utilized successfully to link a variety of hydrophobic esters with tobramycin. Nine lipophilic tobramycin derivatives with significant structural diversity were   synthesised and characterized.  In a preliminary study, the applicability of the Mitsunobu dehydration reaction for the regioselective formation of an epoxide ring in the ido moiety of the pseudo tetrasaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin system was confirmed. The regioselective ring-opening of the derived epoxide with azide at C3IV of paromomycin was also successfully demonstrated.  In total, forty-two new potential aminoglycoside antibiotics have been synthesized and characterized.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">Aminoglycosides</field><field name="subject">Drug Targeting</field><field name="subject">Synthetic Modification</field><field name="subject">Lipophilic Groups</field><field name="subject">Mitsunobu</field><field name="subject">aminoglycoside antibiotics</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071024.151619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School Leadership, Culture, and Teacher Stress: Implications for Problem Students</field><field name="creator">Quinn, Andrea Jean</field><field name="description">Contextual factors linked to behaviour problems in schools include leadership, organisational culture (within individual schools), and levels of teacher stress.  Efforts to improve the school environment, reduce teacher stress, and improve student outcomes often have a singular focus on behaviour management policy.  The aim of this research concerns the direction of effects from these variables, and offers an alternative perspective on the environment-behaviour equation.  That is, while student misbehaviour is viewed as a 'producer' of teacher stress, it may also be perceived as a 'product'.  An initial qualitative investigation (Study 1) invited behaviour management staff (N = 23) to participate in focus groups, where three questions were posed in relation to the overall research aims.  Content analysis was performed on the transcribed focus group data, and revealed that the hypothesised direction of effect between the variables of interest appeared probable.  Participants for the main studies (Studies 2 and 3) were teaching staff (N = 136), school administrators (N = 17) and students referred for behavioural problems (N = 1432) at seven Brisbane metropolitan schools.  Teachers and school administrators completed both the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire and the Organisational Culture Inventory, while teachers also completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory.  Student data was collated from school records, and grouped according to categories of referral frequency per student.  In Study 2, high referral rates were associated with transactional leadership, and the Oppositional aspect of Aggressive-Defensive culture.  Low and medium referral rates were associated with transformational leadership and the Dependent, Approval, and Avoidant aspects of Passive-Defensive culture, and the Affiliative aspect of Constructive culture.  Regression tests found further support for the proposed path model and the hypothesised direction of effects. Transactional leadership and the Passive-Defensive and Aggressive-Defensive culture types were most influential in prediction of referral rates for student misbehaviour.  Unexpectedly, teacher stress was non-significant in explanation of referral rates for student misbehaviour.  Study 3 examined hypothesised differences in perception between school administrators and teaching staff, according to the leadership and organisational culture dimensions.  Both groups endorsed transformational leadership as the dominant style, although results differed by degree for each group.  In terms of school culture, differences between groups were again evident, as teachers' perceptions of school culture were significantly more negative compared to school administrators.  Overall, qualified support was found for the hypothesised direction of effects from school environment variables on referral rates for student misbehaviour.  Leadership style and school culture emerged as most important for the student outcome variable, and may be important in consideration of school-based approaches to behaviour management.  Additionally, teacher stress, while related to school leadership style and organisational culture, appeared to have no effect on student referral rates.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Problem students</field><field name="subject">educational leadership</field><field name="subject">organisational culture</field><field name="subject">aggressive-defensive culture</field><field name="subject">passive-defensive culture</field><field name="subject">school culture</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060308.095357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Autecology of Bactrocera cacuminata (Hering) (Diptera:Tephritidae:Dacinae): Functional Significance of Resources</field><field name="creator">Raghu, Sathyamurthy</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the autecology of the dacine species, Bactrocera cacuminata (Hering) (Diptera: Tephritidae: Dacinae). I specifically focused on the adult phase of the life cycle and resources believed to be significant to this life stage. The prevailing paradigm in dacine ecology predicts that the larval host plant serves as the centre of dacine activity, a state mediated by mutualistic associations with fruit fly-type bacteria. Contrary to predictions, an explicit test of this hypothesis found that the host plant of B. cacuminata, Solanum mauritianum Scopoli, acted almost exclusively as a site for oviposition and larval development. Other key adult behaviours, most notably feeding and mating, were rare at the host plant. Even in disturbed habitats, the paucity of key adult behaviours such as mating was striking. Adult flies of this species were therefore hypothesized to be utilizing other components of their habitat, i.e. resources vital to their life history requirements. Some of the resources that B. cacuminata are known to respond to include sugar, protein, methyl eugenol and the host plant. The latter three resources are believed to be critical in the reproductive success of dacine flies in general. I assessed the physiological status of flies arriving at these resources to determine if flies of different status foraged for resources differently. In dacines, the internal reproductive structures of the male and female flies have been used as predictors of physiological status. I quantified expansion of the male ejaculatory apodeme in B. cacuminata with age of fly and found that there is a threshold apodeme size that is strongly correlated Abstract with sexual maturity. Maturity of female flies could be accurately predicted by ovarian development. Using these methods to assess the physiological and nutritional status of flies arriving at resources (larval host plant, protein and methyl eugenol) in the field, I discovered that only sexually mature and mated females were responding to the host plant, while the males at the host plant were sexually immature. This confirmed the hypothesis that the host plant primarily served as an oviposition site. Additionally, this study revealed that sexually mature males with high nutritional reserves were most commonly collected at methyl eugenol (a plant-derived chemical that elicits a strong response in males of many dacine species) at dusk, the time of peak sexual activity in this species. This indicated that methyl eugenol was perhaps a significant resource in the context of the reproductive behaviour of this species. Methyl eugenol (ME) is one of group of phenyl propanoids to which males of certain species of Dacinae respond. The current hypothesis of the role of these phenyl propanoids is that they function as pheromone precursor chemicals. Response to these chemicals is hypothesized to be a trait under sexual selection. In Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), this effect is so strong that a single feeding on ME results in a strong mating advantage up to a month after males feed on the chemical. Bactrocera cacuminata fed on multiple occasions on ME in a laboratory bioassay. After a single 24-hour exposure to ME, investigations of mating competitiveness did not reveal any obvious advantage for ME-fed males over unfed males. However, ME-fed males did enjoy a higher mating success 16 and 32 days after exposure to the chemical, suggesting that some physiological benefits unrelated to the pheromone synthesis was driving this delayed advantage. Investigation of the physiological consequences of feeding on ME revealed no enhancement of nutritional or energetic reserves, suggesting that the delayed mating advantage observed was more likely a chance event. An alternate hypothesis about the proximate function of ME, proposed by Robert Metcalf, is that it serves as a mate rendezvous site. As mating behaviour was notably absent at the host plant, I tested Metcalf&#146;s hypothesis. A field-cage experiment, spatially separating adult resources (host plant, methyl eugenol, sugar and protein) clearly demonstrated that methyl eugenol was functioning as a mate rendezvous stimulus for B. cacuminata. This is the first direct support for Metcalf&#146;s hypothesis. A synthesis of the literature revealed that significantly greater ecological and evolutionary information was required to understand the basis of dacine response to phenyl propanoids. Different dacine species may be utilizing these chemicals differently, even if their evolutionary origin may have been as a plant based kairomone. My studies show that generalizations on the ecology and behaviour of Dacinae, often extrapolated from research on a few pest species, do not hold up in the case of B. cacuminata. This suggests that a more autecological, species-specific approach is required in dacine research, before any predictive generalizations can be made.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diptera</field><field name="subject">Tephritidae</field><field name="subject">Dacinae</field><field name="subject">Dacus</field><field name="subject">Bactrocera cacuminata (Hering)</field><field name="subject">fruit fly</field><field name="subject">fruit flies</field><field name="subject">life cycle</field><field name="subject">autecology</field><field name="subject">animal behaviour</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">habitats</field><field name="subject">animal populations</field><field name="subject">insect populations</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030605.162831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A General Modelling System and Meta-Heuristic Based Solver for Combinatorial Optimisation Problems</field><field name="creator">Randall, Marcus Christian</field><field name="description">There are many real world assignment, scheduling and planning tasks which can be classified as combinatorial optimisation problems (COPs). These are usually formulated as a mathematical problem of minimising or maximising some cost function subject to a number of constraints. Usually, such problems are NP hard, and thus, whilst it is possible to find exact solutions to specific problems, in general only approximate solutions can be found. There are many algorithms that have been proposed for finding approximate solutions to COPs, ranging from special purpose heuristics to general search meta-heuristics such as simulated annealing and tabu search. General meta-heuristic algorithms like simulated annealing have been applied to a wide range of problems. In most cases, the designer must choose an appropriate data structure and a set of local operators that define a search neighbourhood. The variability in representation techniques, and suitable neighbourhood transition operators, has meant that it is usually necessary to develop new code for each problem. Toolkits like the one developed by Ingber's Adaptive Simulated Annealing (Ingber 1993, 1996) have been applied to assist rapid prototyping of simulated annealing codes, however, these still require the development of new programs for each type of problem. There have been very few attempts to develop a general meta-heuristic solver, with the notable exception being Connolly's General Purpose Simulated Annealing (Connolly 1992). In this research, a general meta-heuristic based system is presented that is suitable for a wide range of COPs. The main goal of this work is to build an environment in which it is possible to specify a range of COPs using an algebraic formulation, and to produce a tailored solver automatically. This removes the need for the development of specific software, allowing very rapid prototyping. Similar techniques have been available for linear programming based solvers for some years in the form of the GAMS (General Algebraic Modelling System) (Brooke, Kendrick, Meeraus and Raman 1997) and AMPL (Fourer, Gay and Kernighan 1993) interfaces. The new system is based on a novel linked list data structure rather than the more conventional vector notation due to the natural mapping between COPS and lists. In addition, the modelling system is found to be very suitable for processing by meta-heuristic search algorithms as it allows the direct application of common local search operators. A general solver is built that is based on the linked list modelling system. This system is capable of using meta-heuristic search engines such as greedy search, tabu search and simulated annealing. A number of implementation issues such as generating initial solutions, choosing and invoking appropriate local search transition operators and producing suitable incremental cost expressions, are considered. As such, the system can been seen as a good test-bench for model prototypers and those who wish to test various meta-heuristic implementations in a standard way. However, it is not meant as a replacement or substitute for efficient special purpose search algorithms. The solver shows good performance on a wide range of problems, frequently reaching the optimal and best-known solutions. Where this is not the case, solutions within a few percent deviation are produced. Performance is dependent on the chosen transition operators and the frequency with which each is applied. To a lesser extent, the performance of this implementation is influenced by runtime parameters of the meta-heuristic search engine.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">combinatorial optimisation problems</field><field name="subject">COPs</field><field name="subject">heuristics</field><field name="subject">meta-heuristics</field><field name="subject">computer algorithms</field><field name="subject">simulated annealing</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051116.120133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Internet Use on Inter-Firm Relationships in Service Industries</field><field name="creator">Rao, Sally L.</field><field name="description">Internet marketing and relationship marketing are becoming prevalent in Australian firms. The advent of the internet has created numerous opportunities for marketing professionals to enhance current marketing practices, including relationship marketing. However, the investigation of marketing relationships in an internet environment is scant. Further, there appears to be no investigation of this phenomenon within the context of Australian service industries. Thus this research attempts to bridge the gap that exists between academia and practitioners by investigating internet-facilitated relationship marketing. Given these gaps in the literature, the research problem investigated in this research is: How does B2B internet use affect inter-firm relationships in service industries? The literature does not investigate this research problem in any depth. However, a framework about internet-facilitated marketing relationship in the extant literature was integrated and synthesised with literature about internet marketing and relationship marketing to arrive at three research issues: RI 1: How does level of internet use affect structural and social bonds in an inter-firm relationship? RI 2: How do structural bonds interact with social bonds in an internet environment? RI 3: How do structural and social bonds determine relationship outcomes in an internet environment? To investigate these three research issues, a combination of qualitative and quantitative two-stage methodological approach was used. The first stage was eleven convergent interviews to build on the extant literature and to further confirm and refine the theoretical framework. In the second stage, a survey methodology was used to test the model about internet-facilitated inter-firm relationships in Australian business internet banking users. Data was analysed and the hypotheses specified in the main model were tested using structural equation modelling techniques. Thus this research involved both theory building and theory testing. The findings of this research have implications for the three research issues. The results for the first research issue showed that the internet has little negative impact on relational bonding in the B2B context. That is, technology-mediated transactions in financial services may not be detrimental to established relationships because trade efficiencies are more of a concern for businesses rather than the social aspects. Information technology-enabled connectivity can facilitate trade efficiency, therefore the relationship. Moreover, the impact of internet use on relational bonds of trust and dependence is moderated by the length of B2B internet use. That is, a longer period of dealing with an exchange partner on the internet facilitates relational bonding. The findings for the second research issue were that most interrelationships between structural and social bonds in an internet environment are in line with the generic literature. The findings for the third research issue are related to the relational outcome as a result of bonding. Although the internet has little direct impact on commitment and intention to stay, it contributes indirectly to the relational outcomes through structural and social bonding. In addition, the findings of this research highlight some important issues in relationship marketing research. That is, inter-relationships of the relational constructs depend on the context in which the relationship exists. The main contribution of this theory building research is the development and confirmation of a final theoretical framework about internet-facilitated inter-firm relationships. That framework is a contribution because it is the first rigorously researched step towards understanding the important confluence of two new and powerful streams of business activity of internet marketing and relationship marketing. This thesis has both theoretical and practical implications in the area of internet marketing and relationship marketing. The framework was built from theory and empirical research to represent this process and provides a foundation for further research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">service industries</field><field name="subject">Internet marketing</field><field name="subject">relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">B2B</field><field name="subject">business-to-business Internet</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030812.164252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes and Information Effects in Contingent Valuation of Natural Resources</field><field name="creator">Raybould, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the effects of photographic and text information on respondents' attitudes and willingness-to-pay for a proposed beach protection scheme in the erosion prone Gold Coast region on the east coast of Australia. The research developed two alternative expectancy-value attitude-behaviour models to test residents' attitudes toward relevant targets and behavioural intention, expressed through stated willingness-to-pay, and compared the proposed models with one established attitude-behaviour model. The thesis set out to investigate three central research questions; one question relating to the effects of information on attitudes and willingness-to-pay, and two questions relating to the relationships between attitudes and willingness-to-pay. It was hypothesised that photographs that depicted severe erosion damage would result in more positive attitudes toward, and greater willingness-to-pay for, beach protection than photographs that showed only mild levels of erosion damage. Positive relationships were hypothesised between variables representing attitudes toward beach erosion, attitude toward beach protection, attitude toward paying for beach protection, and willingness-to-pay. Finally, it was hypothesised that the relationships between attitudes and willingness-to-pay could be adequately explained by the proposed attitude-behaviour models. The thesis describes how seven information treatments and eight attitude measurement scales were developed and tested in a pilot experiment before use in a survey of homeowners in the region of interest. Analysis of variance showed that, while respondent's attitude toward beach protection was affected by the information treatments, their willingness-to-pay for the proposed program was insensitive to information. There were no significant effects that could be attributed exclusively to text descriptions of the good but there were significant effects that could be attributed to photographic information treatments. However, none of the effects on attitudes resulted in significant effects on the behavioural intention expressed in stated willingness-to-pay. Analysis of respondents with low previous knowledge of the proposed good revealed more extensive information effects on attitudes, but still not on willingness-to-pay, and this suggests that high levels of previous knowledge in a large proportion of the sample had a moderating effect on attitude change caused by the information treatments. Regression analysis showed that seven of the eight attitude and behaviour variables in the proposed attitude-behaviour model were significant predictors of willingness-to-pay. In the final phase of the analysis, goodness-of-fit indices, estimated using Structural Equation Modelling, indicated a good fit between the data and the attitude-behaviour models tested. Standardised coefficients on the model indicated that perceived behavioural control, expected utility of outcomes, and subjective norms all had strong direct relationships with stated willingness-to-pay, and strong indirect relationships on willingness-to-pay via attitudes toward payment. These results are consistent with the relationships proposed in attitude-behaviour models and the moderating effects of these variables explain why significant information treatment effects were observed on attitude to beach protection but not on willingness-to-pay. This research showed that respondent's willingness-to-pay in a contingent valuation experiment is quite insensitive to photographic treatments when previous knowledge is high and that costly and time consuming testing procedures, recommended by authorities, may not be necessary under these conditions. It also demonstrated that measures of attitude, consistent with an attitude-behaviour model, can be collected easily in a contingent valuation study and can contribute to understanding of participant responses and to identification of protest responses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beach protection (Gold Coast</field><field name="subject">Queensland)</field><field name="subject">beach nourishment</field><field name="subject">structural equation modelling</field><field name="subject">survey methods</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061009.150949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Graduate Rural Women: Perceptions of the Impact and Import of a University Education</field><field name="creator">Redpath, Adrienne Kay</field><field name="description">While there is abundant literature about Australian rural women including references to those who have had or wish to have some form of tertiary education, little attention is given to those who are the subject of the present study, graduate rural women, in this case of the state of New South Wales, Australia. The significance of the research emerged from its focus on the experiences of such women, with the purpose of the study being to present an exploration of their previously unrecorded perceptions of themselves as graduates occupying a place in their rural communities - to articulate the impact and import of graduate status for rural women. As understanding the articulations rather than explaining the data was deemed to be more appropriate to the exploration, a qualitative-interpretivist approach was adopted, recognising that a grounded constructivist epistemology would assist in viewing the experiences through the eyes of the participants. Data were collected in the form of written narrative - correspondence via e-mail - which allowed both the participants and myself to revisit and reflect upon each other's comments. The graduate women's comments were wide-ranging, from matters of concern to all country people, to those which were particularly relevant to graduate rural women, such as the perceived value of their own expertise and their experiences in taking up either professional or other roles in the rural context. The depth of thought, the powers of perception, the identification of lines of reasoning, the development of interwoven themes in rural life, and the manner of expression through the articulation of common occurrences, revealed far more than was originally envisaged. From the resultant collation of data it was possible to identify, examine and associate important perceptions which permeated the lives of graduate rural women. An exploration of the term rural and being a rural person in that environment was an important pre-cursor to interpreting subsequent articulations as the meaning of rurality extended the accepted geographical definitions and comparative urban-rural economic and social relationships. With this understanding, remembered experiences embraced the stages of becoming and being graduate rural women in professional practice and in everyday life, evidencing the participants' introspective, positive appreciation of the impact and import of their university education in the fulfilling and rewarding application of their professional skills. The concluding stage involved the graduates' relationship with the members of their rural communities as they attempted to pursue their lives at the level of their confidence and belief in themselves and in the value of their education. Challenging situations were recounted, indicating a schism to be overcome in that association, with male culture and traditional attitudes, the feminist movement and the rural crisis being included in the considerations. The core concepts, upon which the findings of the research were structured, emerged from the participants' articulations to illustrate the stages of becoming and being graduate rural women, both from the introspective and contextual viewpoints. The written narrative articulations of graduate rural women defined their reflective views of self-empowerment through education, countered by the challenges and constraints of social reality in the application of that ability in the rural context of their professional and everyday lives. The previously unrecorded perceptions of this significant section of society have added to the store of knowledge by giving graduate women a voice, a basis for further expression and a collective presence and identity in the rural situation. The future value of this research lies in its dissemination to raise awareness of identified issues and in its invitation to explore a wider sphere of knowledge enrichment beyond its central focus.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">rural women</field><field name="subject">tertiary education</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">university education</field><field name="subject">university graduates</field><field name="subject">self-perception</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041208.104942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Painting's Wrongful Death: The Revivalist Practices of Glenn Brown and Gerhard Richter</field><field name="creator">Reichelt, Victoria</field><field name="description">This thesis considers how the Twentieth Century 'death of painting' debate brought about a series of challenges and changes to painting that have ironically ensured its survival. This is illustrated in the practice of artists Gerhard Richter and Glenn Brown, whose investigations into painting's failures and limitations have paradoxically resulted in their works demonstrating the continued relevance and success of the medium. Specifically, this discussion analyses Richter's Annunciation After Titian (1973) series and Brown's series of works that appropriate Frank Auerbach paintings (1998 - 2000). These works illustrate the ways in which painting has developed in the last half of the Twentieth Century as a result of the 'death of painting' debate. The primary developments identified are that painting now draws from and references many other media; painting now embraces photography (instead of seeing it as a threat); the use of appropriation in painting is now seen as expansive rather than as representing depletion; there has been a return to romanticism and pleasure in painting; and women are now included in the broader discussion of painting. In considering the 'death of painting' debate, as well as the changes painting has experienced as a result of it, the primary point of departure is Yve-Alain Bois' pivotal essay 'Painting: The Task of Mourning' (1986) and his analysis of Hubert Damisch's 'theory of games'. The evolution of the 'death of painting' debate is also outlined via the writings of Douglas Crimp, Arthur C. Danto, Douglas Fogle, Michael Fried, Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. This thesis also considers how the debate has impacted contemporary painters' practices, as well as how my own practice owes a debt not only to the response of artists like Brown and Richter, but also to the debate itself.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Painting (Fine art)</field><field name="subject">artists in the 21st century</field><field name="subject">art history</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060901.143140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whiteness as Goodness: White Women in PNG &amp; Australia, 1960's to the Present</field><field name="creator">Reid, Patricia Mary</field><field name="description">In this thesis I examine the contemporary nexus between White women and the raced and classed institution of White womanhood. More specifically, I focus on White Australian women who are middle class, rich in cultural capital, and generally consider themselves to be progressive; that is race privileged women but women who are not usually associated with overt racism. My analysis unfolds White Australian women in the discursive context of the ideologies of feminism and feminist-influenced anti-racist politics, as well as the ideologies of femininity. The thesis shows how this nexus is enacted through a vision of White women as Good as expressed in the political commitments, mentalities, relationships, narratives and corporeality of such women. The research problem that I identified and worked through in the thesis is as follows:  for middle class White women, (who can be seen and see themselves as generic 'women'), Whiteness has been seen and played out as Goodness. Further, in the playing out of this Goodness White women accumulate and defend the prestige and privileges of Whiteness. Specifically, I argue that Whiteness is reproduced in some of the discourses and practices of White feminism, by the progressive White women involved in anti-racist politics, and in the femininity industry and the ways it is taken up. The nub of the problem I identify is that White women's involvement in the structures and narratives that support Whiteness is often grounded in the very qualities of character and conduct that emerge from the colonial and class-constructed ideal of White womanhood and which have historically distinguished them from denigrated others. These qualities- notably virtue, innocence and self-restraint- whilst differently nuanced in other contexts are an ongoing expression of the uses made of White womanhood as the visible sign of race and class superiority. The work examines four key periods: the Australian colony of PNG during the decolonising 1960's and 1970's; the high years of 1970's and 1980's feminism; the race debates of the 1990's; and the bodily practices of present day White women gripped by fears of fat and aging. I explore the ways in which White women's Whiteness is played out in benevolent Black/White relationships, the over-reach of difference feminism, particular kinds of anti-racist identities and activism, and body-improvement practices. In all these cultural sites, White women's Whiteness is often represented as a kind of moral being and deployed as moral authority in ways that are consonant with the raced and classed construction of White women as moral texts. My research approach was determined by the research problem I identified. Given my argument that White women mis-recognise Whiteness as Goodness in a race-structured society, then the collecting of data through interviews or surveys would have yielded material subject to this blindness. Instead, I explored sites and material where moral claims were being pressed, and case studies where 'women' were enacting themselves or being represented or interpellated as moral texts. My selection of primary source material ranges from feminist newsletters, women's and other magazines, literature, film, event programs and flyers, radio and television broadcasts, newspapers and websites, as well as reflections on my own experiences. Secondary source material includes feminist theoretical texts as well as texts drawn from a range of other disciplines, and other historical background materials. I lay out and support my arguments using a technique not dissimilar to collage, aiming to construct a picture that is compelling in its detail as well as coherent in its overall effect. This thesis is a contribution to the de-naturalisation of Whiteness. Navigating a course between the opposing hazards of essentialising Whiteness and understating its effects in contemporary Australian society, I have brought into clearer view some of the strategies which maintain the authority of Whiteness.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White women</field><field name="subject">whiteness as goodness</field><field name="subject">race privileged women</field><field name="subject">colonial women</field><field name="subject">race structured society</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070130.140518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From preservice to inservice teaching: a study of conceptual change and knowledge in action</field><field name="creator">Reitano, Paul</field><field name="description">It is argued in this thesis that pedagogical content knowledge is an essential knowledge base for effective teaching, and that its development may not depend on years of experience. The longitudinal study traced the knowledge growth of novice social science teachers, especially pedagogical content knowledge, over their final year of study and first year as practising teachers, and sought to answer the following questions: 1. What is the conceptual structure of effective social science teaching held by preservice and novice teachers? 2. To what extent is pedagogical content knowledge a component of this conceptual structure? 3. What is the importance of pedagogical content knowledge to preservice and novice teachers' conceptions of good practice? The study adopts the theoretical framework of Shulman's (1987) categorization of teacher knowledge. At a minimum, this includes general pedagogical knowledge components of (1)behaviour management, (2) teaching strategies, (3) personal beliefs, and (4)classroom communication; content knowledge; curriculum knowledge;  knowledge of learners and learning; knowledge of educational contexts; educational ends, goals, and purposes and values; and, pedagogical content knowledge. The participants were ten preservice teachers in the final year of their Bachelor of Education (Secondary) studies. Four participants were post-graduate students: two held Bachelor of Applied Science degrees; one a Bachelor of Arts; and the other a Bachelor of Behavioural Science degree. Methods used to identify the participants' knowledge bases were a concept map of "effective social science teaching", a Think Aloud Protocol of the concept map, and video stimulated recall based on a lesson taught by the participant. Three sets of data were elicited during the phases of the study; at the end of the first semester in their final year of study; at the conclusion of that year; and after six months of independent teaching. A case study was constructed for each participant using an interpretive approach. The convergence of the data at each phase of the data collection provided the identification of each participant's knowledge base of teaching. The participants' conceptual structures of social science teaching over time indicated both consistency and change over time. Educational ends, goals, purposes and values and knowledge of learners and learning became significant components of the participants' conceptual structures on realization of teaching practice. The data showed that behaviour management was an important component of their conceptual structure of teaching throughout their development as social science teachers. Pedagogical content knowledge was also a consistent focus of participants' conceptual structure and indeed, on realization of independent teaching practice, most participants' pedagogical content knowledge showed greater links to other aspects of effective teaching than previously. The findings of the study indicate that pedagogical content knowledge does not develop only with experience, and that it can exist as a key component of effective teaching at the novice stage of their teaching. The study showed that novice teachers had a substantive as well as a procedural understanding of pedagogical content knowledge, and that they focused more on goals and purposes of learning and knowing the learner after they began teaching practice.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">student teachers</field><field name="subject">pre-service</field><field name="subject">in-service</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="subject">pedgogical content knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041110.134020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Ecology and Conservation of the White-Striped Freetail Bat (Tadarida australis) in Urban Environments</field><field name="creator">Rhodes, Monika</field><field name="description">Of all anthropogenic pressures, urbanisation is one of the most damaging, and is expanding in its influence throughout the world. In Australia, 90% of the human population live in urban centres along the eastern seaboard. Before European settlement in the early 1800s, much of the Australia's East coast was dominated by forests. Many of the forest dependent fauna have had to adapt to forest fragmentation and habitat loss resulting from clearing for urbanisation. However, relatively few studies have investigated the impact of urbanisation on biodiversity. This is especially true for the remaining fauna in large metropolitan areas, such as Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. The physical and conceptual context of this thesis is the increasing impact of urbanisation and the potentially threatening factors to forest dependent fauna. Bats were selected because they comprise a third of Australia's mammal species, and therefore form a major component of Australia's biodiversity. Very little is known about the ecology and conservation biology of hollow-dependent bats in general, but particularly in urban environments. The study was conducted in Brisbane, south-east Queensland, one of Australia's most biodiverse regions. More than a third of Australia's bat species occur in this region. A large insectivorous bat, the white-striped freetail bat (Tadarida australis), was selected to study two key resources in this urban area - hollow availability and foraging habitat. This thesis also examined if artificial roost habitat could provide temporary roosts for white-striped freetail bats and other insectivorous bats and assessed whether these bat boxes can be used as a conservation tool in urban environments where natural hollow-availability is limited. The white-striped freetail bat is an obligate hollow-dweller and roosted largely in hollows of old or dead eucalypts throughout Brisbane's urban matrix. These roost trees harboured significantly more additional hollow-dependent species compared to control trees of similar age, height, and tree diameter. Roost cavities inside trees often exceeded 30 cm in diameter. Furthermore, maternity colonies used cavities of hollow trunks, which often extended into major branches, to roost in big numbers. Therefore artificial alternatives, such as small bat boxes, may provide temporary shelter for small roosting groups, but are unlikely to be suitable substitutes for habitat loss. Although five bat species used bat boxes during this study, the white-striped freetail bat was not attracted into bat boxes. Roost-switching behaviour was then used to quantify associations between individual white-striped freetail bats of a roosting group. Despite differences in gender and reproductive seasons, the bats exhibited the same behaviour throughout three radio-telemetry periods and over 500 bat-days of radio-tracking: each roosted in separate roosts, switched roosts very infrequently, and associated with other tagged bats only at a communal roost. Furthermore, the communal roost exhibited a hub of socialising between members of the roosting group especially at night, with vocalisation and swarming behaviour not found at any of the other roosts. Despite being spread over a large geographic area (up to 200 km2), each roost was connected to others by less than three links. One roost (the communal roost) defined the architecture of the network because it had the most links. That the network showed scale-free properties has profound implications for the management of the habitat trees of this roosting group. Scale-free networks provide high tolerance against stochastic events such as random roost removals, but are susceptible to the selective removal of hub nodes, such as the communal roost. The white-striped freetail bat flew at high speed and covered large distances in search for food. It foraged over all land-cover types found in Brisbane. However, its observed foraging behaviour was non-random with respect to both spatial location and the nature of the ground-level habitat. The main feeding areas were within three kilometers of the communal roost, predominantly over the Brisbane River flood plains. As the only mammal capable of flight, bats can forage above fragmented habitats. However, as this study showed, hollow-dependent insectivorous bats, including free-tailed bats, are specialised in their roosting requirements. The ongoing protection of hollow-bearing trees, and the ongoing recruitment of future hollow-bearing trees, is essential for the long-term conservation of these animals in highly fragmented landscapes. Furthermore, loss of foraging habitat is still poorly understood, and should be considered in the ongoing conservation of bats in urban environments.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tadarida australis</field><field name="subject">insectivorous bat</field><field name="subject">anthropogenic pressures</field><field name="subject">Australia's biodiversity</field><field name="subject">foraging habitat</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070314.114451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Symbolism in the Courtroom: An Examination of the Influence of Non-Verbal Cues in a District Court Setting on Juror Ability to Focus on the Evidence</field><field name="creator">Richardson, Christine Rosalie</field><field name="description">Described in this thesis is research that examined the influence of courtroom symbolism on jurors' ability to focus on the evidence presented in a criminal trial. This research is unique as participants were 'real' jurors who had, at the time of participation in the research, recently completed deliberations on a District Court trial. To date no other research has explored the interaction between symbolism in the courtroom and the juror experience. The broad research question examined in this research was: Do symbolic elements in the courtroom environment draw juror attention away from the evidence being presented?. Three theories drawn from environmental psychology were utilised in this research (i.e., environmental uncertainty theory, environmental arousal theory and environmental load theory). Additionally, Rapoport's (1983, 1990) theory, which was drawn from the architectural field of knowledge, was utilised. Rapoport's theory facilitated the measurement of symbolism in the form of environmental cues found in the courtroom. To address the broad research question, eight subordinate research questions were formulated those being: (1) Do trait anxiety and court related factors influence the amount of attention jurors pay to the elements of the courtroom environment?, (2) Do trait anxiety and court related factors influence the effect on jurors of the attention they paid to the elements of the courtroom environment?, (3) Do trait anxiety and court related factors influence the sense of stress or arousal in jurors?, (4) Is there an association between attention paid by jurors to the environmental cues found in the courtroom, their ability to perform their role as a juror and their sense of appreciation for the function of the law?, (5) Is there an association between attention paid by jurors to the environmental cues in the courtroom and a state of elevated stress?, (6) Does the amount of attention paid by jurors to environmental cues found in the courtroom diminish over time?, (7) Does the effect on jurors of the attention they paid to the environmental cues in the courtroom diminish over time? and, (8) Does the amount of stress jurors experience diminish over time?. The eight research questions were addressed in two studies. The first involved a survey of jurors who had completed deliberations in District Court trials in Brisbane and Cairns during the period 19th July, 2001 and 18th July, 2002 (N=192). This study examined the amount of attention jurors paid to four elements of the courtroom environment (i.e., the courtroom design, the appearance and behaviour of court officials, the appearance and behaviour of those associated with the offence and the task of being a juror). Also examined in this study was the influence on jurors of the attention they paid to the elements of the courtroom environment. Juror experience of state anxiety as measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI] (Spielberger, 1983) was also examined. Additionally, the influence of trait anxiety as measured by the STAI (Spielberger, 1983) and court related factors (i.e., location of trial, prior jury experience, nature of the offence and length of trial) on the juror experience was examined. Two time frames were examined (i.e., initial contact with the courtroom and midpoint of juror experience) which allowed the examination of the influence of time on the juror experience. Interviews with jurors who had completed the survey (N=19) comprised the second study. This study allowed jurors to describe their experience on a jury from a more personal perspective. The elements of the juror experience that distracted and reinforced their ability to focus on the evidence and facilitated a sense of appreciation for the function of the law were discussed. Also discussed were the elements of the juror experience that caused jurors to experience anxiety. Overall, the findings of this research indicated that although symbolism in the courtroom was linked to juror anxiety, this was positive and facilitated juror attention to the evidence and a sense of respect for the criminal justice system. That anxiety experienced by jurors facilitated their focus on the evidence is consistent with environmental arousal theory in that for optimum performance one must experience a certain level of arousal. Also confirmed by the findings of this research is environmental load theory, an element of which predicts that jurors will be task driven when experiencing environmental load. That these two theories are linked by an underlying construct is evidenced by the findings of this research. These findings open up possibilities for future theoretical research using environmental arousal theory and environmental load theory. The findings of this research also suggest that jurors found the symbolism in the courtroom environment distracting and that some elements of the juror experience were onerous and stressful. However, previous experience in the courtroom and lower trait anxiety moderated these factors. Consequently, consistent with the results of this research courts might benefit from implementing an orientation program for prospective jurors such that they are familiarised with the courtroom environment. Such a program would moderate any distress experienced by jurors. In the context of such adjustments by the courts, the influence of symbolism in the courtroom are considered beneficial to the juror experience and there is no need for the courts to alter the courtroom setting or robing practices of lawyers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Courtroom symbolism</field><field name="subject">environmental uncertainty theory</field><field name="subject">environmental arousal theory</field><field name="subject">environmental load theory</field><field name="subject">District Court settings</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070314.095406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terrible Beauty: Ideology and Political Discourse in the Early Plays of Sean O'Casey</field><field name="creator">Riordan, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that prominent in the purposes of the dramaturgy of Irish playwright Sean O'Casey was the promotion of his political causes - most notably socialism. In his avidity for the cause of establishing a workers' paradise, following the Soviet model, in Ireland, his ire was drawn to the movements and institutions he perceived as distracting the masses from pursuit of this ideal: republicanism and the Church. These political ideals are prominent themes in his collected works - both fiction and non-fiction. The work is essentially divided into two sections. The first examines the development of O'Casey's ideologies - his socialism, anti-nationalism and anti-clericalism - and the backdrop against which they developed. The purpose is to establish just how passionately O'Casey felt about these ideals and how, in his letters, histories and autobiographies, he dedicated much of his effort to promoting them. Having dedicated so much time and energy to championing socialism and attacking the Church in these texts, it is little wonder they should appear so prominently in his plays. The thesis argues that O'Casey distorted the content of his Autobiographies  to reinforce his role as self appointed champion of Dublin's "bottom fifth" and his beloved working class. It contends that O'Casey embellished the suffering of his childhood and the hardship endured by his family to fortify his credentials as a "socialist hero" - to be "for them" he sought to be "of them," and to provide a model for how learning and conversion to the socialist ideal would liberate them from the economic oppression that kept them low. A number of facts, even elementary ones like the number of children in the Casey brood and particular dates and addresses where he had lived, were changed to cultivate the working class hero image, the disadvantaged boy who rose up against all that an unjust and unsympathetic world could throw at him, that he so coveted. The more abject the origins, the greater the final triumph. The thesis then looks briefly at the origins and purposes of the Abbey Theatre, and its part in the Irish Renaissance that gave O'Casey his start. It focuses particularly on the role of Yeats, and his desire to build a dramatic movement which created work free from opinion. His famous determination to "reduce the world to wallpaper" brought him into conflict with O'Casey, who saw his plays as a legitimate vehicle for the expression of his own world view. It is important, in terms of the objective of this study, to establish that O'Casey's works were deliberately constructed pieces of didacticism, to demonstrate just how inimical to the original intent of the movement his purposes were. With this in mind, it is instructive to compare him with the other great Irish dramatist of the period, John Millington Synge, whose works, with their more rustic focus, promoted the kind of impressionistic 'slice of life' theatre the Abbey founders were championing. For O'Casey, the cause was paramount. He wrote morality plays. The study examines how O'Casey's dominant ideological position evolved by examining his own changing perspective about the world around him. It shows how O'Casey began to see all struggles in terms of the economic one between classes, and how he came to be converted to the tenets of socialism. His opposition to nationalism and his anti-clericalism essentially reflected his belief that they were hostile to the interests of the workers, and therefore must be engaged. The dominant sources in this section are O'Casey's letters, his Autobiographies, and his book,  The Story of the Irish Citizen Army. The second section of the thesis focuses on the first seven extant plays: The Harvest Festival, The Shadow of a Gunman, Juno and the Paycock, The Plough and the Stars, The Silver Tassie, Within the Gates, and The Star Turns Red, and examines how each promotes O'Casey's causes. The purpose of the thesis is not to promote a reworking of the biographical detail of O'Casey's life, but to trace the shift in the playwright's ideology - from Protestant Orange to Republican Green and finally, and most steadfastly, Socialist Red - and examine how these beliefs found voice in the characters and construction of his earlier plays.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sean O'Casey</field><field name="subject">Irish drama</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">Irish playwrights</field><field name="subject">Irish dramatists</field><field name="subject">Irish literature</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">political ideology</field><field name="subject">socialism</field><field name="subject">socialist</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040615.132200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Auditory Attentional Processing and Attentional Behaviour in Accounting for Deficits in Cognitive Abilities of Children Exposed to Environmental Lead</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Russell James</field><field name="description">The effects of lead poisoning have been known for centuries and the deleterious effects of chronic, low to moderate levels of lead exposure on children's cognitive functioning is now well-established (Needleman &amp; Gatsonis, 1990; Schwartz, 1995).  Similarly, low and moderate levels of lead exposure early in life have been frequently associated with behavioural disturbances later in life in children and animals.  However, few studies have systematically investigated the link between lead-induced deficits in cognitive functioning and lead-induced behavioural disturbances.  This project describes a series of studies investigating the effects of lead on auditory processing and attentional behaviour, and their ability to account for the deleterious effects of lead on IQ in children participating in the Port Pirie Cohort study. Capillary blood samples were collected from the children at various ages from birth to 2 years, and annually thereafter until the age of 7.  A measure of lifetime PbB was calculated for each child using the geometric mean of all the blood lead samples.  This measure of lifetime PbB was used as a continuous explanatory variable in each of the studies described below.  A variety of sociodemographic, health, anthropometric, birth and developmental covariates and potential confounders were recorded prospectively and concurrently.  Using Needleman et al.'s (1996) analysis protocol, 8 of these covariates were included in all final regression models. Study One: A total of 387 children from Port Pirie, Australia (mean age of 7.7 years) participated in a study of children&#146;s simple auditory processing.  Children completed a series of monaural listening tasks across 4 ear/hand conditions.  It was hypothesised that auditory reaction time and auditory processing accuracy would be related the lifetime PbB.  Analysis revealed no significant associations between lifetime PbB and the reaction time to target words and a small significant association (3.6%) between lifetime PbB and accuracy of target word detection in just one of the four ear/hand conditions.  The strongest associations were found between PbB and false responses to distractor words (10.1%, after adjusting for confounders).  It was speculated that this pattern of results could be explained via lead effects on other processes such as impairments to impulse control or attentional processes. Study Two: Study Two investigated the effect of lifetime PbB on children&#146;s complex auditory processing.  In this study participants completed dichotic listening tasks across 4 different ear/hand conditions.  After controlling for potential confounders, lifetime PbB accounted for 6.2% of the variance in the accuracy of target word detection.  A weak direct association (3.0% of the adjusted variance) was also found between lifetime PbB and target word reaction time.  No significant associations were found between lifetime PbB and the percentage of false responses or the speed of the false responses.  Again the pattern of results was suggestive of a deficit in attentional processes such as freedom from distraction and impulse control. Study Three: This study hypothesised that lead-induced impairments to attentional behaviour - similar to those observed in Studies One and Two - would be observed in other contexts.  The mothers of 492 cohort children, and teachers of 454 of the children participated in this study.  The mean age of children for whom ratings were collected was 7 years and 4 months.  Two versions of the Conner&#146;s Behavior Rating Scale were used to rate the children&#146;s behaviour: The Parent Rating Scale and the Teacher Rating Scale.  Lifetime PbB accounted for a significant amount of the variance in Conner&#146;s Parent Behavior Rating Scale scores.  It accounted for 5.9% and 7.3% of the unadjusted variance in the Immature/Inattentive, and Hyperactive/Impulsive scores respectively.  After adjusting for covariates, each of these associations remained significant.  The associations between lifetime PbB and girls' behaviour scores were much higher (11.2%) than the PbB associations with boys' behaviour scores (4.6%).  The unadjusted associations between lifetime PbB and Teacher Rating Scores, although much lower, were also significant and accounted for between 1.2% and 2.4% of the variance in the behaviour scores.  However, after controlling for potential covariates these associations were no longer significant.  These results indicated that increases in lifetime PbB were associated with higher Hyperactivity/Impulsivity and Immature/Inattention and scores on the Conner's Parent Rating Scale, but not the Conner's Teachers Rating Scale. Study Four: In this study it was hypothesised that a significant association would exist between children&#146;s auditory processing performance and parent and teacher behavioural ratings of inattention and impulsivity.  Correlational analysis was conducted on the data from Studies One, Two, and Three, to ascertain if the behavioural patterns as reported by the children's parents and teachers, were associated with the children's performance on the auditory processing tasks.  Correlational analysis revealed highly significant correlation coefficients in the direction predicted between auditory processing scores and the Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsive scores of the Conner's Parent and Teacher Rating Scales. Study Five:  The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which auditory processing and attentional behaviour scores could account for the lead-induced deficits in children's global cognitive abilities.  Combining IQ data with data from Studies One, Two, and Three, a hierarchical analysis was conducted with lifetime PbB as the continuous explanatory variable.  The analysis entered potential covariates at step 1, behaviour ratings at step 2, auditory processing efficiency in step 3, auditory processing speed in step 4, and lifetime PbB at step 5.  The results indicated that when parent and teacher ratings of behaviour and auditory processing efficiency were included in the model, lifetime PbB no longer accounted for a significant proportion of Verbal, Performance or Full-Scale IQ scores.  On the other hand, further analyses demonstrated that the significant associations between lifetime PbB and parental behaviour ratings could not be accounted for by including IQ scores as mediating variables in the analytical model. Conclusion: The results of this project provide evidence for the deleterious effect of lead exposure on children's auditory processing performance and parent ratings of behaviour.  Further, including these variables in an analysis of the effects of lifetime PbB on IQ served to markedly attenuate direct effect of lead on IQ to the level of non-significance.  Taken together the data implicates disturbances to attentional processes (such as impulsivity and inattention) as possible mediators of lead-induced deficits in IQ.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lead</field><field name="subject">lead poisoning</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">intelligence</field><field name="subject">IQ</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030407.144801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low Energy Collision Induced Vibrational Relaxation in B3II+ou Iodine</field><field name="creator">Rock, Andrew Boyd</field><field name="description">Understanding energy transfer processes is an essential prerequisite for the deep understanding of all chemical processes. This thesis investigates the process of vibrational relaxation (or deexcitation) of highly vibrationally and electronically excited molecular iodine (I2) induced by very low energy collisions in a supersonic free jet with six foreign gases. In an investigation of the state-to-field relaxation of I2 (B 3II+ou, v = 16) induced by collisions with He at temperatures of 2 to 12 K we find that the absolute relaxation rates are an order of magnitude smaller than those at 300 K and that the explanation of the magnitudes of these rates does not require enhancement due to low energy orbiting resonances. We find that the rates scale well with estimated collision encounter rates that account for the attractive part of the intermolecular potential. A second investigation with a much wider scope explores vibrational relaxation from v = 21 to 24 with six foreign gases: He, Ne, Ar, H2, D2 and N2. For this investigation a new type of experimental procedure has been designed and implemented that records a detailed and complete map of the fluorescence from B3II+ouI2 that is resolved with respect to both fluorescence frequency and time. These not only yield state-to-field rates, but coupled with a novel deconvolution method for growth curve fitting, yield absolute state-to-state rates for vibrational relaxation processes with Av=-1, -2, -3 and -4. The dependence of the relaxation rates on the collision partner, temperature and Av are discussed. An exponential dependence on the vibrational energy gap may be adequate to characterise the Av dependence of vibrational relaxation. The frequency resolution of the experimental data also reveals that some of the energy released by vibrational de-excitation is transferred to the rotation of the I2 molecule. We find this process is best characterised by an exponential dependence on the change of I2 angular momentum and that its extent scales with the mass of the collision partner. Measurements of the low-energy collision-induced quenching of B 3II+ouI2 are also reported for all six foreign gases. The possibility arises from the rates that the mechanism for quenching by H2 and D2 at low temperatures is different to that of the other gases and to that for H2 and D2 at high temperatures.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy transfer</field><field name="subject">collision spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">iodine</field><field name="subject">chemical processes</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050920.144408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synanthropy of the Australian Magpie: A Comparison of Populations in Rural and Suburban Areas of Southeast Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Rollinson, Daniel J.</field><field name="description">The urbanised environment provides ecologists with unique situations in which to undertake ecological study. It has been said that urbanisation is like a natural experiment; we often have populations of animals that have gone from living in natural or semi-natural environments to living in a highly modified anthropogenic environment. These situations provide ideal settings to study the ecological and behavioural differences that may develop in populations located in different habitats.  Urbanisation typically results in a minority of species dominating the fauna, and this thesis aimed to examine one such species, the Australian magpie. Despite the magpie being a common and well-liked suburban bird, the majority of previous research on this species has been undertaken within rural or exurban locations. This thesis aimed to examine what actually happens to the species when it lives in the suburban environment. In particular I focused on specific behavioural and ecological features, to see if there were any particular adaptations the suburban magpies showed and also if the suburban habitats provide certain resources favourable to the magpies and what ecological effects these may have. Comparisons of the territory structure and resources of rural and suburban magpies showed that although many features of the territory are similar between rural and suburban locations, notably the choice of native nest trees, magpie territories within suburban areas were smaller and contained more anthropogenic features. The reduced territory size may possibly be related to a greater abundance of key food resources also evident within suburban areas.  Furthermore, suburban magpies are more successful in their foraging attempts, again possibly reflecting a more abundant food supply in suburbia and also the simplified nature of suburban foraging areas might facilitate more successful foraging. The increased foraging success is likely to explain the greater provisioning rate to nestling suburban magpies.  Suburban magpies also utilised human provided foods. I quantified the extent of wildlife feeding within many of the suburban study sites of this thesis (through the use of questionnaire surveys). In each of the locations it was evident that at least one person (usually more) was providing a regular supply of food to wildlife and magpies appeared to be the main recipients of this food. Previous ecological studies suggest the provision of extra food to avian populations is likely to affect the breeding ecology, and this was so for magpies. The suburban populations initiated breeding significantly earlier than rural magpies. To test the influence of food, supplementary food was provided to rural magpies, not currently receiving any additional human provided foods. The fed rural magpies initiated breeding before control rural magpies (i.e. not receiving any additional food) but suburban magpies still initiated breeding before all other groups. This suggests additional factors present within suburbia, such as warmer temperatures, may also control the timing of breeding in magpies.  Magpies in rural and suburban locations lived within different vertebrate communities. Within suburban magpie territories a greater number of intrusions were made by domestic animals, notably dogs (Canis lupus) and cats (Felis domesticus). The frequency of raptors entering the territorial areas occupied by magpies appears to suggest such events are more common in rural areas. The number of humans entering magpie territories was obviously greater in the more populated suburban areas and the majority of magpies responded neutrally to humans. However a group of magpies that previously exhibited extreme aggression towards humans were found to have a greater frequency of aggressive interactions with potential predatory intruders, which were primarily humans. Subsequent examination of the level of corticosterone from this aggressive group of magpies found that a high level of aggressive interactions with potential predators and humans is reflected in higher level of corticosterone, which may have implications for further behavioural and even physiological changes.  An ability to habituate to human in urbanised areas is a key attribute of successful synanthropic species. Comparisons of magpies disturbance distances at different points along the urban gradient (the gradient that runs from the urbaised city to natural wildlands) found suburban magpies only responded to humans when they had approached to a close distance (often less than one metre) and many simply walked away to avoid the approaching human. Rural and exurban magpies responded to humans at greater distances than suburban magpies. The distance at which they responded to the human was usually 100 meters plus, and these magpies always flew away. A continuation of this investigation over a temporal scale again found the large difference in response to humans, with suburban magpies exhibiting a decreased response towards humans. However, a certain proportion of responses from suburban magpies were also aggressive. The examination of disturbance distance over the breeding season found that in suburban magpies the responses of most disturbance distance variables remained similar between breeding stages. Rural magpies, however, exhibited variation in their responses towards humans depending on the stage of breeding. It is suggested that the response of rural magpies may be a typical fear response towards an unusual potential threat.  The studies presented in this thesis show that magpies have the behavioural capacity to take advantage of resources in suburban landscapes that are not available or are in lessor supply in rural landscapes, it is these abilities that facilitate the magpies synanthropy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian magpie</field><field name="subject">Gymnorhina tibicen</field><field name="subject">Australian magpies</field><field name="subject">urban birds</field><field name="subject">suburban birds</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">southeast Queensland</field><field name="subject">synanthropy</field><field name="subject">population</field><field name="subject">populations</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">urban</field><field name="subject">suburban</field><field name="subject">territory</field><field name="subject">territories</field><field name="subject">foraging</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040924.152124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a Risk Assessment Checklist for Juvenile Sexual Offenders: a Meta-Analytic Approach</field><field name="creator">Rombouts, Sacha</field><field name="description">Over the last decade there has been a substantial research effort directed toward understanding recidivism and risk prediction among adult sex offenders. In contrast, the juvenile sex offender field has received much less empirical attention.  Consequently, there are very few risk assessment instruments designed for use with young persons who have committed sexual offences. Available measures do not appear to take into account the higher rates of non-sexual recidivism typical of this population. This thesis aimed to identify risk factors for sexual and non-sexual recidivism among juvenile sex offenders (JSOs) and explore their utility in the context of a risk assessment instrument. In Study One, a meta-analysis was conducted on JSO research to examine risk factors for sexual recidivism. The meta-analysis involved 17 studies and 22 predictor constructs. Seven variables emerged as reliable predictors of sexual recidivism: an index sexual offence involving a stranger victim, a history of physical abuse in the offender's background, the presence of sexual deviance, a non-contact index sexual offence, sexually offending against a greater number of victims, a history of sexual offending, and a history of non-sexual offending. In Study Two, a meta-analysis was performed on JSO research to identify risk factors for non-sexual recidivism. The meta-analysis involved 14 studies and 19 predictor constructs. Six variables emerged as reliable predictors of non-sexual recidivism: a history of non-sexual offending, a history of sexual abuse (negative relationship), the presence of an antisocial orientation, an index sexual offence involving a child victim (negative relationship), a history of physical abuse in the offender's background, and the use of threats/force in the index sexual offence. Taken together, the two meta-analyses were able to identify risk factors specific to sexual recidivism (e.g., sexual deviance) and non-sexual recidivism (e.g., antisocial orientation) as well as risk factors common to both outcomes (e.g., a history of non-sexual offending). These studies therefore made an original and significant contribution to the understanding of recidivism among JSOs. Based upon the meta-analyses, Study Three involved the construction of a risk assessment checklist that could be easily scored from file information. The Juvenile Risk Assessment Checklist (J-RAC) contained 11 items based upon the most consistent operationalisations of the predictors that emerged from the meta-analyses. The J-RAC is unique in the JSO risk assessment field as it contains two scales designed to provide separate estimates of the risk of youth engaging in further sexual and non-sexual recidivism, respectively. The J-RAC was scored based on file information from 82 youth who had been found guilty of sexual offences and referred to a treatment service in Queensland, Australia. The majority of the items possessed good inter-rater reliabilities and the two scales both possessed high inter-rater reliabilities. An existing JSO risk assessment instrument, the Juvenile Sex Offender Assessment Protocol Version 2 (J-SOAP-II; Prentky &amp; Righthand, 2003), was also administered and the J-RAC possessed significant correlations with the majority of the J-SOAP-II scales. The J-RAC was also found to significantly discriminate between juveniles in detention and juveniles in the community, with those in detention found to be at higher risk on both scales. Thus, the reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the J-RAC was established. Consistent with current adult sex offender recidivism theory, the findings demonstrated the distinct roles of sexual deviance and antisocial orientation in the prediction of sexual and non-sexual recidivism of JSOs, respectively. The current thesis goes some way towards advancing a theory of juvenile sex offender recidivism by drawing upon the variables that emerged as reliable risk factors in the two meta-analyses. While the J-RAC could not yet be considered an actuarial instrument capable of assigning low, medium and high risk levels, the results of the research conducted in this thesis are encouraging. The utility of the J-RAC may be further enhanced through the aid of prospective research that incorporates substantial numbers of juvenile recidivists.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Juvenile sex offenders</field><field name="subject">sexual recidivism</field><field name="subject">antisocial orientation</field><field name="subject">Juvenile Risk Assessment Checklist</field><field name="subject">J-RAC</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070123.151237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Playing Second Fiddle: A History of the Relationship Between Technology and Organisation in the Australian Music Economy (1901-1990)</field><field name="creator">Rooney, David</field><field name="description">This thesis is a socio-economic history of the relationship between music technology and organisational practices in twentieth-century Australia. It argues that the history of technology in the Australian music economy is dependent not only upon the changing technical characteristics of musical instruments and electronic consumer goods but also upon government policy-making, management practices in music technology manufacturing firms and patterns of music technology consumption. The thesis examines economic statistics regarding the import, export and local production of music technology in Australia. The economic statistics have not previously been examined in relation to the history of music technology in Australia. The historical analysis is structured according to a four-part periodisation which includes the Electric Age (1901-1930), the Electronic Age (1930-1950), the Transistor Age (1950-1970) and the Information Age (1970-1990). This periodisation enables the analysis to continually be refocussed as the key technological and socio-economic dynamics change. With this perspective, the history of the relationship between technology and organisation in the Australian music economy has been demonstrated to be dependent on a number of key technological changes. The thesis examines changes including the shift from acoustic to electric recording; the development of transistor-based consumer electronics goods; and the advent of digital information technology. However, a number of key social determinants, particularly organisational modes, are examined including changes from protectionist to more deregulated trade policy; lack of business skills in areas such as marketing, manufacturing technique and industrial research and development; and the development of a sense of popular modernity which is expressed in the consumption of new, technically advanced and glamorous music technology. In addition to the new perspectives on the history of music technology provided by the analysis of empirical economic data, this thesis contributes to the historiography of technology. The analytical framework it proposes locates music technology within what is described as an assemblage of technologies: technologies of production, technologies of sign systems, technologies of power and technologies of the self. This approach makes clear the interdependence of technological and social factors, and the inadequacy of narrow technological determinist and social constructivist accounts. The notion of an assemblage of technologies is further embellished by drawing upon key elements of recent theories of systems analysis: the seamless web, evolution and chaos theory. Through this analytical framework and the socio-economic analysis of the relationship between music technology and organisational practices, the thesis demonstrates that the history of technology cannot be understood unless it is seen as part of a complex and interacting technical, social, economic and institutional system.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music technology</field><field name="subject">Australian music economy</field><field name="subject">historiography of technology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050920.154417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being Single, Being Church</field><field name="creator">Rose, Martin J</field><field name="description">The world of the 20-21st century is one of rapid change - for family life, for our work environments, in friendship structures and general attitudes about ourselves.  We question who we are and our values.  We seek to understand ourselves more fully as individuals and as groups within a world of flux.  Within this context a significant change that has taken place in the church is the growing emergence of people remaining single for a variety of reasons.  I understand that the term 'single' denotes that group of baptised Christians who have never married and who have chosen to remain single  or who continue to affirm their singleness but not foreclosing on the possibility of marriage.  As with any change, the transition that is required is never easy. Raymond Brown (1979)  touched upon this type of transition and movement for change in society when he said that more and more are finding the single life-style suitable as new territory in which to dwell. They see the structures of society beginning to shift. They see a growing awareness on the part of many people toward an acceptance of single adulthood. This growing awareness has also been paralleled within the thinking of the church.  However, many single men and women 'generally feel that the church has geared its ministry toward those who are married and towards nuclear family units'.   The reflection by Brown  reflects  my own thought about being single, particularly with regard to single people and their being church.  I will argue in this thesis that being single has theological value as a way of living out one's baptismal call to follow Christ in work, relationships, in attitudes and values.  This thesis represents a critical search in, my own need for self-understanding  as a single person together with other single people as I believe we contribute to our society and to our Christian calling. At the beginning of Mark's gospel Jesus' baptism is recorded as a prelude to his ministry:  It was at this time that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptised in the Jordan by John.  No sooner had he come up out of the water than he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit, like a dove, descending on him.  And a voice came from heaven, 'You are my Son, the Beloved; my favour rests on you' (Mark 1:9-11). Jesus' baptism is the impetus and is  at the heart of his ministry for a mission that is favoured by God.  Likewise, baptism is at the heart of the single person's way of living for Christ. Further, the sentiments of Paul in Ephesians 3: 14-21 serve as a goal for all Christians which includes single men and women.  Paul speaks about a unique relationship with Christ, one based on love and openness to Christ. This, then, is what I pray, kneeling before the Father, from whom every family, whether spiritual or natural, takes its name: Out of his infinite glory, may he give you the power through his Spirit for your hidden self to grow strong, so that Christ may live in your hearts through faith, and then, planted in love and built on love, you will with all the saints have strength to grasp the breadth and the length, the height and the depth; until, knowing the love of Christ, which is beyond all knowledge, you are filled with the utter fullness of God. Glory be to him whose power, working in us, can do infinitely more than we can ask or imagine; glory be to him from generation to generation in the Church and in Christ Jesus for ever and ever.  Amen. Jesus' baptism as depicted in Mark together with Paul's thoughts concerning  the reception of the power of the Spirit for our hidden selves to grow in love and faith and journeying with others in the Christian tradition, represent the underlying theological attitude of this thesis about the single person.  The single person by the nature of his or her baptism, is called to follow Christ - to grow in personal stature as one who is open to the presence of Christ in and through the events of daily life.  Integral to this baptismal call is the need to challenge those constructs which don't enhance and give voice to the single person within the church.  I consider that one such construct is the notion of 'vocation' as it has been used traditionally in  the church's  thinking for its self-understanding.  In this regard, it is my contention that 'vocation' is about following Christ in and through baptism. How one lives one's life is his or her career choice; how one lives in response to Christ - whether as married or single, priest or religious.  It is our primary vocation to follow Christ as promised at baptism. The chosen definition, however, ought not to exclude those Christians who, for reasons beyond their control, for example find themselves living the single life because of their  separation from their partner  or are widowed, although the primary thrust of the definition will focus on those Christians who continue to affirm their choice for the single way of life.  The term Church here is explained by Lumen Gentium 9: 'This was to be the new People of God. For, those who believe in Christ, who are reborn not from a perishable but from an imperishable seed through the Word of the living God (cf. 1 Pet. 1:23), not from the flesh but from water and the Holy Spirit (cf. Jn. 3:5-6), are finally established as 'a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people.' This definition has been chosen as it articulates a point of view about the people who comprise the church. In particular the definition speaks of the 'signs' of baptism - water and the Holy Spirit.  It is these signs that characterise those called by God through baptism to be the people of God, the purchased people. I argue that the sacrament of baptism is what characterises all in the church irrespective of their state. The primary methodology for our critical examination of the meaning of the single state is by case study.  The Case Study method will allow me to elaborate upon a developmental theological perspective from within the Vatican Council documents.  By this method I examine the single state from within the ecclesial as well as a sociological understanding.  Secondly a dialectical approach will enable me to argue the case for the single state as a valid way of life.  From this I aim to highlight the single state and its key attributes as well as to provide a personal perspective about single living.  Further, this secondary method allows me to highlight the way in which single people contribute to, and are a part of the life of the church. This twofold methodology enables me to look at the particular issue of the single state within the wider context of the church, and to argue for the significance of the part to the whole.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">Church community</field><field name="subject">faith</field><field name="subject">single persons</field><field name="subject">theology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070105.151933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational and Workforce Restructuring in a Deregulated Environment: A Comparative Study of The Telecom Corporation of New Zealand (TCNZ) and Telstra</field><field name="creator">Ross, Peter</field><field name="description">In the late 1980s, governments in New Zealand and Australia began to deregulate their telecommunications markets.  This process included the corporatisation and privatisation of former state owned telecommunications monopolies and the introduction of competition.  The Telecom Corporation of New Zealand (TCNZ) was corporatised in 1987 and privatised in 1990.  Its Australian counterpart, Telstra, was corporatised in 1989 and partially privatised in 1997.  This thesis examines and compares TCNZ and Telstra's changing organisational and workforce restructuring strategies, as they responded to these changes.  It further examines how these strategies influenced the firms' employment relations (ER) policies.  Strategic human resource management (SHRM) and transaction costs economics (TCE) theories assist in this analyse.  TCE links organisational restructuring to the make/buy decisions of firms and the asset-specificity of their employees.  It suggests that firms will retain workers that have developed a high degree of firm-specific skills, and outsource more generic and semi-skilled work.  Firm strategies are also influenced by national, contextual, factors.  From a TCE perspective, these external factors alter relative transaction costs.  Hence, different ownership structures, ER legislation and union power help to explain differences in TCNZ and Telstra's organisational restructuring and ER strategies. During the decade from 1990 to 2000, TCNZ and Telstra cut labour costs through large-scale downsizing programs.  Job cuts were supported by outsourcing, work intensification and the introduction of new technologies.  These initial downsizing programs were carried out through voluntary redundancies, across most sections of the firms.  In many instances workers simply self-selected themselves for redundancies.  TCNZ and Telstra's downsizing strategies then became more strategic, as they targeted generic and semi-skilled work for outsourcing.  These strategies accorded with a TCE analysis.  But TCNZ and Telstra engaged in other practices that did not accord with a TCE analysis.  For example, both firms outsourced higher skilled technical work.  TCNZ and Telstra's continued market domination and the emphasis that modern markets place on short term profits, provided possible reasons for these latter strategies.  This thesis suggests, therefore, that while TCE may help to predict broad trends in 'rational organisations', it may be less effective in predicting the behaviour of more politically and ideologically driven organisations aiming for short term profit maximisation. Some TCNZ and Telstra workers were shifted to subsidiaries and strategic alliances, which now assumed responsibility for work that had previously been performed in-house.  Many of these external firms re-employed these workers under more 'flexible' employment conditions.  TCNZ and Telstra shifted to more unitarist ER strategies with their core workers and reduced union influence in the workplace.  Unions at Telstra were relatively more successful in retaining members than their counterparts at TCNZ.  By 2002, TCNZ and Telstra had changed from stand-alone public sector organisations, into 'leaner' commercially driven firms, linked to subsidiaries, subcontractors and strategic alliances.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business deregulation</field><field name="subject">corporate deregulation</field><field name="subject">organisational restructuring</field><field name="subject">workforce restructuring</field><field name="subject">corporate restructuring</field><field name="subject">Telecom Corporation of New Zealand</field><field name="subject">TCNZ</field><field name="subject">Telstra</field><field name="subject">telecommunications companies</field><field name="subject">telecommunications industry</field><field name="subject">corporatisation</field><field name="subject">strategic human resource management</field><field name="subject">SHRM</field><field name="subject">transaction costs economics</field><field name="subject">TCE</field><field name="subject">privatisation</field><field name="subject">downsizing</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030930.155125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A New Approach Towards Bicyclo[4.2.0]octan-1-ols: Synthetic and Mechanistic Studies</field><field name="creator">Rowen, Catherine Carmel</field><field name="description">The reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and phenyl vinyl sulfoxide resulted in the formation of the novel bicyclooctanol sulfoxides 215-217 and the monoalkylated sulfoxide 218.  The effects of variation in reaction time, temperature and concentration were studied.  Under optimal conditions (10 minutes, -10&#176;C and 0.085 M) the ratio of the bicyclooctanol sulfoxides 215-217 (75% yield) to the monoalkylated sulfoxide 218 was 95:5.  The bicyclooctanol sulfoxides 215-217 were characterised as the sulfone derivatives, bicyclooctanol sulfones 219 and 220.  X-ray crystal structures were used to determine the relative stereochemistry of the bicyclooctanol sulfoxides 215-217 and the bicyclooctanol sulfones 219 and 220. Bicyclo[4.2.0]octano-1-ol formation was determined to occur via an ionic mechanism.  Mechanistic studies were carried out using variations in reaction lighting and reaction solvent, conducting the reaction in the presence of a radical trap and quenching the reaction with a deuterium label.  The role of the counterion was determined to be important in the formation of the bicyclooctanol sulfoxides 215-217.  Sequestering lithium ions with HMPA and substituting lithium with potassium favoured alkylation.  Substituting the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with the dimethylaluminium enolate of cyclohexanone resulted in a different distribution of the bicyclooctanol sulfoxides 215-217 and the formation of bicyclooctanol sulfoxide 243.  Transition states to account for these differences have been proposed.  The stability of the bicyclooctanol sulfoxides under conditions of acid, base and heating was studied.  Thermal ring opening of the bicyclooctanol sulfoxides 215 and 216 to the monoalkylated sulfoxides 218A and 218B respectively occurred with retention of the configuration at sulfur.  The relative stereochemistry of the individual bicyclooctanol sulfoxides 215-217 was considered to account for the observed stability in each case. The reaction between the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone and (R)-(+)-p-tolyl vinyl sulfoxide 193 gave the bicyclooctanol tolyl sulfoxides 246, 251 and 252 and the monoalkylated tolyl sulfoxide 247.  This showed that both bond rotation in the side chain of the intermediate and epimerisation at sulfur occurred in the bicyclo[4.2.0]octan-1-ol forming process.  The presence of the sulfoxide functionality in phenyl vinyl sulfoxide was determined to be crucial to the formation of bicyclo[4.2.0]octan-1-ols.  In the reaction with the lithium enolate of cyclohexanone, phenyl vinyl sulfide gave no reaction, phenyl vinyl sulfone gave the bicyclic disulfones 260-265, ethyl acrylate gave the diesters 266-268 and diphenylvinylphosphine oxide gave the phosphine oxide 269.  The cyclobutanol 270 and the ketone 271 were the products resulting from the reaction between the reaction between the lithium enolate of acetophenone and phenyl vinyl sulfoxide.  This demonstrated potential scope for the cyclisation process using both cyclic and acyclic ketones.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sulfoxides</field><field name="subject">bicyclooctanol sulfoxides</field><field name="subject">x-ray crystallography</field><field name="subject">organic chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030602.131636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FDTD Modelling For Wireless Communications: Antennas and Materials</field><field name="creator">Saario, Seppo Aukusti</field><field name="description">The application of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for the numerical analysis of complex electromagnetic problems related to wireless communications is considered. Since exact solutions to many complex electromagnetic problems are difficult, if not impossible, the FDTD method is well suited to modelling a wide range of electromagnetic problems. Structures considered include single and twin-slot antennas for millimetre-wave applications, monopole antennas on mobile handsets and chokes for the suppression of currents on coaxial cables. Memory efficient techniques were implemented for the split-field perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition. The frequency-domain far-field transformations were used for the calculation of far-field radiation patterns. Dipole, slot and mobile handset antenna benchmark problems verified the accuracy of the FDTD implementation. The application of slot antennas for millimetre-wave imaging arrays was investigated. An optimal feed network for an offset-fed single-slot antenna was designed for the X band with numerical and experimental results in excellent agreement. A twin-slot antenna structure reduced surface wave coupling by 7.6 dB in the substrate between coplanar waveguide-fed slot antenna elements in a planar array. The reduction of substrate surface waves for the twin-slot antenna allows for closer element spacings with less radiation pattern degradation in array applications. Suppression techniques for currents flowing on the exterior surface of coaxial cables were investigated. These include the use of ferrite beads and a quarter-wave sleeve balun. The frequency dependent behaviour of ferrite based chokes showed highly resonant effects which resulted in less than 5 dB of isolation at the resonant frequencies of the bead. An analysis of air-gaps between the ferrite bead and cable are shown to be extremely detrimental in the isolation characteristics of ferrite bead chokes. An air-gap of 0.5 mm can reduce the isolation effectiveness of a bead by 20 dB. The first rigorous analysis of a quarter-wave sleeve balun is presented, enabling an optimal choke design for maximum isolation. A standard 0.25[symbols] sleeve balun achieved 10.9 dB isolation with [symbols]=4, whereas a choke of optimal length 0.232[symbols] had an isolation of better than  -20 dB. Several techniques for the measurement of antenna characteristics of battery powered handsets were compared and perturbation effects associated with the direct connection of a coaxial cable to a mobile handset was quantified. Significant perturbation in both return loss and radiation pattern can occur depending on cable location on the handset chassis. The effectiveness of ferrite chokes in any location was marginal. However, the application of an optimal quarter-wave sleeve balun in the centre of the largest plane of the handset, orthogonal to the primary polarisation resulted in minimal perturbation of both radiation patterns and return loss.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Finite-difference time-domain method</field><field name="subject">wireless communications</field><field name="subject">antenna</field><field name="subject">antennas</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030602.101319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acute and Chronic Adaptations To Intermittent and Continuous Exercise in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients</field><field name="creator">Sabapathy, Surendran</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this thesis was to develop a better understanding of the physiology and perceptual responses associated with the performance of continuous (CE) and intermittent exercise (IE) in patients with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A secondary aim was to examine factors that could potentially limit exercise tolerance in COPD patients, particularly in relation to the dynamics of the cardiovascular system and muscle metabolism. The results of the four studies conducted to achieve these aims are presented in this thesis. In Study 1, the physiological, metabolic and perceptual responses to an acute bout of IE and CE were examined in 10 individuals with moderate COPD. Each subject completed an incremental exercise test to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer.  Subjects then performed IE (1 min exercise: 1 min rest ratio) and CE tests at 70% of peak power in random order on separate days. Gas exchange, heart rate, plasma lactate concentration, ratings of breathlessness, inspiratory capacity and the total amount of work completed were measured during each exercise test. Subjects were able to complete a significantly greater amount of work during IE (71 &#177; 32 kJ) compared with CE (31 &#177; 24 kJ). Intermittent exercise was associated with significantly lower values for oxygen uptake, expired ventilation and plasma lactate concentration when compared with CE. Subjects also reported a significantly lower rating of breathlessness during IE compared to CE. The degree of dynamic lung hyperinflation (change in end-expiratory lung volume) was lower during IE (0.23 &#177; 0.07 L) than during CE (0.52 &#177; 0.13 L). The results suggest that IE may be superior to CE as a mode of training for patients with COPD. The greater amount of total work performed and the lower measured physiological responses attained with intermittent exercise could potentially allow greater training adaptations to be achieved in individuals with more limited lung function. The purpose of Study 2 was to compare the adaptations to 8 wk of supervised intermittent and continuous cycle ergometry training, performed at the same relative intensity and matched for total work completed, in patients with COPD. Nineteen subjects with moderate COPD were stratified according to age, gender, and pulmonary function, and then randomly assigned to either an IE (1 min exercise: 1 min rest ratio) or CE training group. Subjects trained 3 d per week for 8 wk and completed 30 min of exercise. Initial training intensity, i.e., the power output applied during the CE bouts and during the exercise interval of the IE bouts, was determined as 50% of the peak power output achieved during incremental exercise and was increased by 5% each week after 2 wk of training. The total amount of work performed was not significantly different (P=0.74) between the CE (750 &#177; 90 kJ) and IE (707 &#177; 92 kJ) groups. The subjects who performed IE (N=9) experienced significantly lower levels of perceived breathlessness and lower limb fatigue during the exercise-training bouts than the group who performed CE (N=10). However, exercise capacity (peak oxygen uptake) and exercise tolerance (peak power output and 6-min walk distance) improved to a similar extent in both training groups. During submaximal constant-load exercise, the improved (faster) phase II oxygen uptake kinetic response with training was independent of exercise mode. Furthermore, training-induced reductions in submaximal exercise heart rate, carbon dioxide output, expired ventilation and blood lactate concentrations were not different between the two training modes. Exercise training also resulted in an equivalent reduction for both training modes in the degree of dynamic hyperinflation observed during incremental exercise. Thus, when total work performed and relative intensity were the same for both training modes, 8 wk of CE or IE training resulted in similar functional improvements and physiological adaptations in patients with moderate COPD. Study 3 examined the relationship between exercise capacity (peak oxygen uptake) and lower limb vasodilatory capacity in 9 patients with moderate COPD and 9 healthy age-matched control subjects. While peak oxygen uptake was significantly lower in the COPD patients (15.8 &#177; 3.5 mL&#183;min-1&#183;kg-1) compared to the control subjects (25.2 &#177; 3.5 mL&#183;kg-1&#183;min-1), there were no significant differences between groups in peak calf blood flow or peak calf conductance measured 7 s post-ischemia. Peak oxygen uptake was significantly correlated with peak calf blood flow and peak conductance in the control group, whereas there was no significant relationship found between these variables in the COPD group. However, the rate of decay in blood flow following ischemia was significantly slower (p less than 0.05) for the COPD group (-0.036 &#177; 0.005 mL&#183;100 mL-1&#183;min-1&#183;s-1) when compared to the control group (-0.048 &#177; 0.015 mL&#183;100 mL-1&#183;min-1&#183;s-1). The results of this study suggest that the lower peak exercise capacity in patients with moderate COPD is not related to a loss in leg vasodilatory capacity. Study 4 examined the dynamics of oxygen uptake kinetics during high-intensity constant-load cycling performed at 70% of the peak power attained during an incremental exercise test in 7 patients with moderate COPD and 7 healthy age-matched controls. The time constant of the primary component (phase II) of oxygen uptake was significantly slower in the COPD patients (82 &#177; 8 s) when compared to healthy control subjects (44 &#177; 4 s). Moreover, the oxygen cost per unit increment in power output for the primary component and the overall response were significantly higher in patients with COPD than in healthy control subjects. A slow component was observed in 5 of the 7 patients with COPD (49 &#177; 11 mL&#183;min-1), whereas all of the control subjects demonstrated a slow component of oxygen uptake (213 &#177; 35 mL&#183;min-1). The slow component comprised a significantly greater proportion of the total oxygen uptake response in the healthy control group (18 &#177; 2%) than in the COPD group (10 &#177; 2%). In the COPD patients, the slow component amplitude was significantly correlated with the decrease in inspiratory capacity (r = -0.88, P less than 0.05; N=5), indicating that the magnitude of the slow component was larger in individuals who experienced a greater degree of dynamic hyperinflation. This study demonstrated that most patients with moderate COPD are able to exercise at intensities high enough to elicit a slow component of oxygen uptake during constant-load exercise. The significant correlation observed between the slow component amplitude and the degree of dynamic hyperinflation suggests that the work of breathing may contribute to the slow component in patients with COPD.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients</field><field name="subject">exercise tolerance</field><field name="subject">gas exchange</field><field name="subject">heart rate</field><field name="subject">plasma lactate concentration</field><field name="subject">breathlessness</field><field name="subject">inspiratory capacity</field><field name="subject">dynamic hyperinflation</field><field name="subject">slow component amplitude</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070115.170236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Damping Characteristics of Reinforced and Prestressed Normal- and High-Strength Concrete Beams</field><field name="creator">Salzmann, Angela</field><field name="description">In the last few decades there has been a significant increase in the design strength and performance of different building materials.  In particular, new methods, materials and admixtures for the production of concrete have allowed for strengths as high as 100 MPa to be readily available.  In addition, the standard manufactured yield strength of reinforcing steel in Australia has increased from 400 MPa to 500 MPa.   A perceived design advantage of higher-strength materials is that structural elements can have longer spans and be more slender than previously possible.  An emerging problem with slender concrete members is that they can be more vulnerable to loading induced vibration.  The damping capacity is an inherent fundamental quantity of all structural concrete members that affects their vibrational response.  It is defined as the rate at which a structural member can dissipate the vibrational energy imparted to it. Generally damping capacity measurements, to indicate the integrity of structural members, are taken once the structure is in service. This type of non-destructive testing has been the subject of much research.  The published non-destructive testing research on damping capacity is conflicting and a unified method to describe the effect of damage on damping capacity has not yet been proposed.  Significantly, there is not one method in the published literature or national design codes, including the Australian Standard AS 3600-2001, available to predict the damping capacity of concrete beam members at the design stage.  Further, little research has implemented full-scale testing with a view to developing damping capacity design equations, which is the primary focus of this thesis. To examine the full-range damping behaviour of concrete beams, two categories of testing were proposed.  The categories are the 'untested' and 'tested' beam states.  These beam states have not been separately investigated in previous work and are considered a major shortcoming of previous research on the damping behaviour of concrete beams.  An extensive experimental programme was undertaken to obtain residual deflection and damping capacity data for thirty-one reinforced and ten prestressed concrete beams.  The concrete beams had compressive strengths ranging between 23.1 MPa and 90.7 MPa, reinforcement with yield strengths of 400 MPa or 500 MPa, and tensile reinforcement ratios between 0.76% and 2.90%.  The full- and half-scale beams tested had lengths of 6.0 m and 2.4 m, respectively.  The testing regime consisted of a series of on-off load increments, increasing until failure, designed to induce residual deflections with increasing amounts of internal damage at which damping capacity (logarithmic decrement) was measured. The inconsistencies that were found between the experimental damping capacity of the beams and previous research prompted an initial investigation into the data obtained.  It was found that the discrepancies were due to the various interpretations of the method used to extract damping capacity from the free-vibration decay curve.  Therefore, a logarithmic decrement calculation method was proposed to ensure consistency and accuracy of the extracted damping capacity data to be used in the subsequent analytical research phase. The experimental test data confirmed that the 'untested' damping capacity of reinforced concrete beams is dependent upon the beam reinforcement ratio and distribution.  This quantity was termed the total longitudinal reinforcement distribution.  For the prestressed concrete beams, the 'untested' damping capacity was shown to be proportional to the product of the prestressing force and prestressing eccentricity.  Separate 'untested' damping capacity equations for reinforced and prestressed concrete beams were developed to reflect these quantities. To account for the variation in damping capacity due to damage in 'tested' beams, a residual deflection mechanism was utilised.  The proposed residual deflection mechanism estimates the magnitude of permanent deformation in the beam and attempts to overcome traditional difficulties in calculating the damping capacity during low loading levels.  Residual deflection equations, based on the instantaneous deflection data for the current experimental programme, were proposed for both the reinforced and prestressed concrete beams, which in turn were utilised with the proposed 'untested' damping equation to calculate the total damping capacity.  The proposed 'untested' damping, residual deflection and total damping capacity equations were compared to published test data and an additional series of test beams.  These verification investigations have shown that the proposed equations are reliable and applicable for a range of beam designs, test setups, constituent materials and loading regimes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">beam</field><field name="subject">beam</field><field name="subject">reinforced</field><field name="subject">reinforcement</field><field name="subject">prestressed</field><field name="subject">damping</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040430.133844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Where The Boys Are: The Experiences of Adolescent Boys and Their Female Teacher in Two Single Sex Drama Classrooms</field><field name="creator">Sanders, Tracey</field><field name="description">This qualitative case study explores the experiences of adolescent boys and their female teacher in two single sex drama classrooms over a two year period. It has been influenced by sociological and educational frames of knowledge with a specific emphasis on gender studies. Driven by the work of Biddulph (1995), Bly (1990), Pollack (1999), Hawkes (2001), Hartman (1999), Connell (1995,1996) and Kenway (1997), this research is ideologically grounded in theories that investigate the areas of masculinity, boys' education and drama practice. It takes as its pivotal focus the notion that educationally, adolescent boys are facing complex and troubled times and that a reassessment of the way boys are taught in schools is crucial. Additionally, the role and influence of the female teacher in the single sex boys' classroom was significant, providing an essential backdrop for investigating the classroom experiences of the boys. In the area of educational drama, research into adolescent boys and classroom drama is still unfolding.This thesis contributes to knowledge in this area and reveals the important benefits and potential that educational drama holds for empowering young males to explore their own masculine identities and understand their world with clarity and insight. Data collected during this research forms the basis of a narrative journey shared between the reader and the researcher. The research is heavily grounded in the ethnographic tradition of 'telling stories' from the field - stories which reveal the authentic lived experiences of the participants. Part of the greater story told here includes that of the researcher and documents some of the more notable challenges and highlights of working in the field over an extended time frame. Specifically, the research addresses the following questions: What benefits do adolescent boys perceive they gain from doing drama? How do adolescent boys communicate with each other in the drama classroom? How do adolescent boys approach drama work in their classroom? How do they perceive their own experiences and relationships in a single-sex drama classroom? What role does their female teacher play in their experiences in the drama classroom? The research revealed a number of important considerations for the fields ofsociology, gender studies and education. Amongst some of the major findings was the potential of drama to break down stereotypical notions associated with masculinity and boys' abilities to excel in area such as the Arts. The enjoyment and fulfillment that the boys felt they gained from participating in drama resulted in a heathlier classroom environment characterised by a greater tolerance and understanding of each boy's individual masculinity. It was also revealed that the presence of a female drama teacher was considered an advantage, granting the boys access to a field of knowledge and feeling that was different to their 'male ways of knowing.' Additionally, for the field of drama, the research revealed that the value of solid planning, a defined understanding of contemporary drama practice and implementing learning experiences carefully and thoughtfully grounded in the lives of the students, cannot be underestimated as essential components of effective drama teaching.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teenage boys</field><field name="subject">adolescent boys</field><field name="subject">drama teaching</field><field name="subject">drama study</field><field name="subject">secondary education</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">female teachers</field><field name="subject">high school education</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030818.152042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic Person Verification Using Speech and Face Information</field><field name="creator">Sanderson, Conrad</field><field name="description">Identity verification systems are an important part of our every day life. A typical example is the Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) which employs a simple identity verification scheme: the user is asked to enter their secret password after inserting their ATM card; if the password matches the one prescribed to the card, the user is allowed access to their bank account. This scheme suffers from a major drawback: only the validity of the combination of a certain possession (the ATM card) and certain knowledge (the password) is verified. The ATM card can be lost or stolen, and the password can be compromised. Thus new verification methods have emerged, where the password has either been replaced by, or used in addition to, biometrics such as the person&#146;s speech, face image or fingerprints. Apart from the ATM example described above, biometrics can be applied to other areas, such as telephone &amp; internet based banking, airline reservations &amp; check-in, as well as forensic work and law enforcement applications. Biometric systems based on face images and/or speech signals have been shown to be quite effective. However, their performance easily degrades in the presence of a mismatch between training and testing conditions. For speech based systems this is usually in the form of channel distortion and/or ambient noise; for face based systems it can be in the form of a change in the illumination direction. A system which uses more than one biometric at the same time is known as a multi-modal verification system; it is often comprised of several modality experts and a decision stage. Since a multi-modal system uses complimentary discriminative information, lower error rates can be achieved; moreover, such a system can also be more robust, since the contribution of the modality affected by environmental conditions can be decreased. This thesis makes several contributions aimed at increasing the robustness of single- and multi-modal verification systems. Some of the major contributions are listed below. The robustness of a speech based system to ambient noise is increased by using Maximum Auto-Correlation Value (MACV) features, which utilize information from the source part of the speech signal. A new facial feature extraction technique is proposed (termed DCT-mod2), which utilizes polynomial coefficients derived from 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of spatially neighbouring blocks. The DCT-mod2 features are shown to be robust to an illumination direction change as well as being over 80 times quicker to compute than 2D Gabor wavelet derived features. The fragility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) derived features to an illumination direction change is solved by introducing a pre-processing step utilizing the DCT-mod2 feature extraction. We show that the enhanced PCA technique retains all the positive aspects of traditional PCA (that is, robustness to compression artefacts and white Gaussian noise) while also being robust to the illumination direction change. Several new methods, for use in fusion of speech and face information under noisy conditions, are proposed; these include a weight adjustment procedure, which explicitly measures the quality of the speech signal, and a decision stage comprised of a structurally noise resistant piece-wise linear classifier, which attempts to minimize the effects of noisy conditions via structural constraints on the decision boundary.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biometric identification systems</field><field name="subject">biometrics</field><field name="subject">voice biometrics</field><field name="subject">speech biometrics</field><field name="subject">principal component analysis</field><field name="subject">principal components analysis</field><field name="subject">PCA</field><field name="subject">face recognition</field><field name="subject">facial recognition</field><field name="subject">multi-modal verification systems</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030422.105519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automating Class Schedule Generation in the Context of a University Timetabling Information System</field><field name="creator">Sandhu, Kuldeep Singh</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the university timetable generation problem. It begins with a discussion on the conflicting terminology used and differentiates between the terms scheduling and timetabling. This discussion integrates with an overview of the problem itself both from practical and academic perspectives. This is followed by a summary of the apparently effective timetable solution generation algorithms. The literature is then examined in detail from that perspective.  This literature review is then summarised in a form to highlight the use of these different solution algorithms. A classification schema is developed and the summary of the literature presented within the framework of this schema. Trends in the research literature result from this presentation and an extrapolation to future research trends are suggested. An information system based upon the need to support timetable production and maintenance is presented. Given the very practical outcomes expected of timetable research, the information system was designed to enable the whole range of administrative functions performed by teachers to be either directly supported or readily modified to prove such support. The implementation of this particular system is given and resulting timetables are presented and discussed. The system generated manual and automated timetables and these were produced by trailing a number of objective functions. It was noted that the determination of the optimal objective function is dominated by specific individual institutional criteria. It is suggested that this would make a more than significant project for future information systems research. From the literature it is noted that the timetable generation problem, as reported time and time again in the literature, has been solved. Such claims lead to a benchmark which is proposed to enable an initial comparison of the effectiveness of proposed solutions by different researchers. The thesis then presents a summary of the work that was carried out and offers direction for future research. It is noted that despite the fifty years of research conducted into this area there exists a significant number of research avenues still to be pursued.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">timetabling</field><field name="subject">timetables</field><field name="subject">timetable management information systems</field><field name="subject">scheduling</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030825.121338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Auditor Switching - A Two-Stage Decision Process: An Empirical Study of Australian Companies</field><field name="creator">Sands, John Stephen</field><field name="description">This dissertation is concerned with a primary and two secondary research issues. The primary issue pertains to the existence of a two-stage auditor switching decision process; that is the auditor change and the auditor selection stages. The two secondary issues concern the relative influence of variables within their respective decision stages. External auditors are engaged not only to comply with the Corporations Law requirement and Australian Stock Exchange membership conditions but also to reduce the degree of information risk assigned by financial statement users to financial statements prepared by auditee management. The decision to switch auditors may cause financial statement users to assign a higher degree of information risk to financial statements, i.e., the indirect costs of switching auditors. A substantial increase in these indirect costs may have occurred as the average rate that Australian publicly listed companies switch auditor has increased in recent years. However, prior research has provided inconsistent and inconclusive evidence with regard to the variables that influence auditees to switch auditors. To avoid mis-perceptions by financial statement users about the newly appointed auditors' attestation of the financial information prepared by auditees, a greater understanding is needed of the auditor switching decision process to assist in mitigating these indirect costs of switching auditors. In prior research the underlying suggestion why auditees switch auditors is the development of a mis-match of audit services demanded to the services supplied by the incumbent auditor. To overcome this mis-match, auditees after deciding to change auditors then select a specific audit firm that offers suitable services and possesses suitable characteristics. A suggested reason for the inconsistent findings of prior research is that there are two decision stages (auditor change and auditor selection) in the auditor switching decision process and past studies have examined, intentionally or otherwise, different decision stages. From a two decision stage perspective, there are three additional explanations for the inconsistent findings of prior research. These explanations are 1) the inappropriate use of surrogate measures for the decision stage studied, 2) the misuse of the terms auditor change, auditor selection and auditor switching, and 3) the inappropriate research methodology and instrument design employed. This absence of a 'shared agreement' among researchers about the two-stage auditor switching decision concept and misuse of terms may have confused not only researchers but also survey participants and readers of auditor switching literature thus contributing to the inconsistencies in prior evidence as well as perpetuating the inconsistent results where the readers are the future researchers. A review of the literature identified five characteristic variables of the incumbent and replacement audit firms that influence the auditor switching decision. Four variables (disagreements between auditees and auditors that result in, or are caused by, the issuance of a qualified audit report and recommendations from three external sources) in addition to the five incumbent auditor characteristics were found to influence only the auditor change decision. In addition to the five replacement auditor characteristic variables, a further five variables, involving audit firm image creation or other promotional activities, have been found to influence the auditor selection decision stage. A primary and two secondary problems regarding the auditor switching decision process are addressed (1) How and to what extent does the impact of the five auditor characteristics on Australian auditees' decisions to change auditors (to terminate the incumbent auditor's appointment) differ from that on auditees' decisions to select the replacement auditor? (2) How and to what extent are the nine variables used by Australian auditee management in the decision to change auditors (to terminate the incumbent auditors appointment)? (3) How and to what extent are the ten variables used by Australian auditee management in the decision to select a replacement auditor? The provision of evidence to support the two-stage auditor switching decision process may be achieved by jointly examining and identifying significant differences in the perceived influence of auditor characteristics across the two decision stages and a comparison of their rank order of influence within each stage. Three empirical models are constructed to investigate these three research questions. Using the MANOVA (within-subjects) design, the first model is to analyse each respondent's perception of the level of influence of each of the five auditor characteristic variables across the two decision stages. The second and third empirical models are using an one-way ANOVA design to test the influence of each of the respective independent variables (i.e., nine variables for the change decision and ten variables for the selection decision) on the respective dependent variable (i.e., the change decision or the selection decision). Fifty-three usable responses were received from Australian companies identified as voluntarily switching auditors for the reporting year ended 1990 and/or 1991. The data collected for analysis were provided by company executives of these companies. The major findings of this study are: 1) Two of the five auditor characteristics, 'level of audit quality' and 'suitability of non-audit services', differed significantly in their level of relative influence across the two decision stages. Furthermore, there was some support in the results for a perceived difference in the influence of a third auditor characteristic, 'size of audit fees', across both stages. 2) Significant differences were perceived in the level of influence of variables on the auditor change decision stage. The six most influential variables were the higher audit fees, the auditor's offices were not located near the auditee's geographically dispersed offices, the incumbent auditor's lack of industry specialisation, a higher audit quality was not provided, the non-audit services offered were unsuitable, and director's recommendations. 3) In the auditor selection decision stage, significant differences were perceived in the level of influence of variables. The six most influential variables were the lower fees, the recommendations of business colleagues, a higher quality audit can be provided, the suitability of range of non-audit services, the closeness of the auditor's offices to the auditee's geographically dispersed operations, and the availability of industry specialisation. 4) A comparison of the rank order of influence of auditor characteristic variables within each decision stage found variances exist for two variables 'closeness of auditor's offices to the auditee's operations' and 'the level of industry specialisation' across the two stages. 5) The significant difference in the level of influence of characteristics of the incumbent and replacement auditors in the first finding suggests that auditors are not perceived as providing homogeneous services. Furthermore, from the significant difference in these auditor characteristic variables within each decision stage in the second and third findings imply that the auditor characteristics of an auditor are not perceived as homogeneous. The following major conclusions are drawn from this study. The evidence from these major findings support the existence of a two-stage auditor switching decision process. The results also show that auditor switching decision makers' perceptions of the variables that influence auditor switching vary across the two decision stages and with the auditor change and auditor selection decisions. Finally, because the characteristics of the auditors vary in their perceived influence across both stages and within each decision stage, these variances suggest the auditor characteristics supplied are perceived to be heterogeneous. This perceived heterogeneity permits audit firms to differentiate their services offered and requires auditees to employ a two-stage auditor switching decision process.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Selection of auditor</field><field name="subject">auditor switching</field><field name="subject">Australian companies</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050901.152229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superelastic Electron Scattering from Laser Excited States of Sodium</field><field name="creator">Sang, Robert Thomas</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of a series of experiments in which electrons are superelastically scattered from various laser excited states of sodium. The atoms, once in the optically prepared state, are forced to relax via the superelastic collision with an electron. The rate of detection of superelastically scattered electrons was measured as a function of the laser polarisation which enabled pseudo Stokes parameters to be determined. These pseudo Stokes parameters are functions of both optical pumping parameters and atomic collision parameters. The optical pumping parameters describe the laser-atom interaction and the atomic collision parameters describe the electron-atom collision process. Three different laser excitation mechanisms were used to optically pump the atoms into various excited states. The first of these used a single laser tuned to the 32S 112(F'=2 hyperfine state)-~32P312 transition. The excited atoms underwent a superelastic collision with an electron leaving the atom in the ground state and pseudo Stokes parameters were measured as a function of both scattering angle and incident electron energy. The second superelastic experiment, utilised a folded step excitation mechanism which employed two lasers tuned from the two hypethne states of the 32S112 ground state respectively to the 32P312 excited state. Power broadening effects in the single laser experiment cause the atoms to be optically pumped into the F= 1 hyperfine ground state. The laser powers used were not great enough to power broaden the hyperfine ground states and as such the F'= 1 sublevel effectively acted as a sink. The folded step excitation method enabled the excited state population to be increased so that data at larger scattering angles could be obtained. Stokes parameters from both of these experiments which had an incident energy range of 10eV to 30eV and an angular range of 5&#176;-25&#176; were compared to three current electron-atom scattering theories and previous experimental data. Overall, fair to good agreement was found between theory and experiments for the individual Stokes parameters. Losses of coherence was observed at small scattering angles (50.200) at 20eV and 25eV incident electron energies which were poorly modelled by the three different theories. The third superelastic experiment involved the use of two lasers of specified polarisation to stepwise excite the atoms to the 32D512 excited state. Superelastic collisions with incident electron energies of 20eV from the 32D512-*32P312~312 collision were studied at three different scattering angles and pseudo Stokes parameters for the case where the polarisations of the radiation from the lasers were parallel were measured. The single step and folded step laser-atom interactions for it excitation were modelled using a full quantum electrodynamical treatment so that the optical pumping parameters from the single and folded step experiments could be investigated. Equations of motion were derived in the Heisenberg picture and it is shown that for the single laser case 59 equations of motion are required to fully model the interaction and for the folded step ease 78 equations of motion are required. The results of calculations demonstrated that the optical pumping parameters were sensitive to laser intensity, laser detuning and the Doppler width of the atomic beam. The theoretical quantum electrodynamical calculation results were in good agreement with the experimental results.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrons</field><field name="subject">laser excited states of sodium</field><field name="subject">laser excitation mechanisms</field><field name="subject">excited atoms</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050921.120911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexible Delivery in Australian Higher Education and its Implications for the Organisation of Academic Work</field><field name="creator">Sappey, Jennifer Robyn</field><field name="description">This doctoral research explores the implications for the employment relationship of the intersection between employment relations and customer relations.  The context for the research is Australian higher education - specifically those university workplaces which are strongly market focused and where resourcing is inadequate to meet customer expectations. Traditionally, serving one's customer has meant providing goods or services (as requested by the customer) and doing so with courtesy (as defined by social custom).  The customer was clearly outside the traditional employment relationship between employer and employee, although a focus of its output. However, in the context of post-Fordist production systems and post-modern values including the rise of consumption, there has occurred an intersection of product and labour markets which has led to changes to the employment relationship and the labour process. The thesis answers the questions:  In higher education, does the student-as-customer have significant influence on the organisation of work? If so, does this constitute a reconfigured model of the employment relationship? The rationale for re-examining the employment relationship in the context of changing consumption patterns lies in the search for more extensive explanations of factors which influence the labour process with the suggestion that consumption is of increasing relevance for industrial relations theory and practice (see for example Heery 1993; Frenkel, Korczynski, Shire and Tam 1999a). The growth of a culture of consumption and changing consumption patterns are symptomatic of change which is central to the Australian economy as a whole and to higher education in particular (Usher, Bryant and Johnson 1997; Scott 1995a). In this context the doctoral research explores the social relations involved in the process of Australian higher education as a service encounter. It examines the implications for the organisation of work in particular, and the traditional bipartite employment relationship in general (between employer and employee although it is noted that the state has a peripheral role), of the student's newly constructed status of customer.  The research focus is on flexible delivery which is seen as a key strategic response by higher education institutions to meet their perceptions of their customers' needs and wants.  Flexible delivery is a pedagogy, a marketing tool and a form of work organisation and is a fertile domain within which to seek the intersection of employment relations and customer relations. In keeping with the labour process ethnographic tradition, this research employs Burawoy's (1991) methodology of Extended Case Method.  This doctoral research raises critical issues related to the incongruence between current Australian national research ethics regimes and long established ethnographic methods employing participant observation.  The practical consequences of the national research ethics regime for empirical research are explored in the concluding chapter. The data identifies that university managements' preoccupation with customer relations has undermined the traditional employment relationship between employing institution and academic. While the academic employee in the service encounter is engaged in the primary relationship of the bipartite employment relationship, management's incorporation of the student-customer into formal organisational processes which may lead to control over the organisation of work, potentially brings into being a tripartite employment relationship between employee/employer/customer.  In such a model, customer relations is no longer merely the output of the employment relationship but a process within it, with customers acting as management's agents of control.  This thesis introduces the concept of the customer as partial-employer. The thesis findings challenge the current management paradigm of customer focus as a 'win-win' situation.  In Australian higher education customer focused strategies have emerged from managerial assumptions about student-customer needs and wants, specifically those of flexibility and value-for-money.  The unintended consequence of these assumptions on the academic labour process has been a significant shift in the balance of power between academic educator and student at the level of the service encounter, with the subjugation of traditional academic authority to the power of the consumer in what has become a market relationship.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Employment relationships</field><field name="subject">employment relations</field><field name="subject">customer relations</field><field name="subject">student as customer</field><field name="subject">culture of consumption</field><field name="subject">bipartite employment relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070228.110927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pyrazolo(3,4-d)Pyrimidines and adenosine receptors: a structure/activity study</field><field name="creator">Scammells, Peter J.</field><field name="description">Pyrazolopyrimidines are a general class of compounds which exhibit Aj adenosine receptor affmity. A number of pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine analogues of isoguanosine and i-methylisoguanosine has been synthesised. All compounds were tested forAi adenosine receptor affinity using a (311) R-PIA competitive binding assay. The N-i and N-5 positions were substituted with a number of different ailcyl and aryi groups. 3-Chiorophenyl substitution of the N-i position and butyl substitution of the N-5 position greatly enhanced the overall adenosine receptor affinity. Substitution by a methyl group at the N-7 position fixed the C-4 position in the imino tautomeric form. This resulted in a marked reduction in activity. The substitution of the N-2 position with a phenyl group produced an analogue with a similar structure to i,3-dipropyl-8-(2-amino-4-chlorophenyl)xanthine (PACPX). A 2-phenyl substituent was favourable for interaction with the adenosine receptor. A number of pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrirnidine analogues of 4,6-bis-a-carbamoylethylthio-i-phenylthiopyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrinhidine (DJB-KK) has also been synthesised and tested for Aj adenosine receptor affinity. 4,6-Bis-alkylthio-1-phenylpyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidines with a-carbamoylethyl and u-carbamoylpropyi groups were compared.

Estuarine suspended sediment (in high concentrations), has the ability to adversely impact upon surrounding ecosystems, such as the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Due to a recent decline in water and sediment quality, it has recently been mandated that a number of tropical, coastal estuarine systems in Queensland, such as the Fitzroy River estuary, have their sediment loading reduced. In order to meet these requirements, a greater understanding of the sediment transport dynamics and driving processes (such as flocculation and settling velocity) needs to be achieved, and the accuracy of estimation improved. This research project was motivated by the need to improve the general accuracy of field measurements for estuarine suspended sediment transport and dynamics. Field-based measurements (especially settling velocity) are necessary for the parameterisation of sediment transport models. The difficulty in obtaining accurate, in situ data is well documented and is generally limited to methods that isolate a water sample from its natural environment, removing all influences of estuarine turbulence. Furthermore, the water samples are often extracted from points (Eulerian) where the history of the suspended particles is generally unknown. These sampling methods typically contain intrinsic errors as suspended sediment transport is essentially Lagrangian (i.e., flows with the net motion of flow-field) in nature. An investigation into different drogue systems conducted in parallel with a study into the tidal states of the Fitzroy River estuary led to the development of a novel Lagrangian drogue device, the LAD. Additionally, the water-tracking ability of the LAD was tested and found to accurately follow a parcel of estuarine water over a slack water period. Therefore the LAD was deployed in the Fitzroy River to assist in the further understanding of complex sediment transport processes such as flocculation and settling velocity in a natural estuarine flow field. The final device (the LAD - Lagrangian Acoustic Drogue) was developed, utilizing the principals of acoustic backscatter intensity-derived SSC measurements. The investigation of a series LAD deployments (during slack water) in the Fitzroy River estuary, revealed the dominant suspended sediment processes and also gave an insight into the prevailing flow-patterns. Results showed the presence of a settling lag mechanism between low and high tide, which can initiate a net sediment flow upstream with each flood tide. The bulk settling velocity showed comparable results at both low and high water. The LAD derived bulk settling velocity as a function of concentration (SSC), yielding a strong positive correlation (r2 = 0.73). Also the importance of flocculation in the bulk settling and clear up of the water column during periods of still water (high and low tide) was demonstrated as all in situ settling velocities (0.33 - 1.75 mm s-1) exceeded single grain approximations (0.47 mm s-1). This research demonstrates the potential for Lagrangian drogue studies as an effective measuring platform for the accurate quantification of estuarine suspended sediment dynamics. The application of the LAD in the Fitzroy River has lead to a significant improvement in the understanding of the system's real sediment transport processes. This research has provided an effective and accurate technique for measuring real settling velocities for input into numerical models or for the validation of existing model outputs. Furthermore, this technique shows great potential for application in other estuarine systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sediment transport</field><field name="subject">estuarine systems</field><field name="subject">Fitzroy River estuary (Queensland)</field><field name="subject">Great Barrier Reef ecosystem</field><field name="subject">Lagrangian acoustic drogue</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070201.144830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring Vegetation Change in the Kosciuszko Alpine Zone, Australia</field><field name="creator">Scherrer, Pascal</field><field name="description">This thesis examined vegetation change over the last 43 years in Australia's largest contiguous alpine area, the Kosciuszko alpine zone in south-eastern Australia. Using historical and current data about the state of the most common vegetation community, tall alpine herbfield, this thesis addressed the questions: (1) what were the patterns of change at the species/genera and life form levels during this time period; (2) what were the patterns of recovery, if recovery occurred, from anthropogenic disturbances such as livestock grazing or trampling by tourists; (3) what impacts did natural disturbances such as drought have on the vegetation and how does it compare to anthropogenic disturbances; and (4) What are the benefits, limitations and management considerations when using long-term data for assessing vegetation changes at the species/genera, life form and community levels? The Kosciuszko alpine zone has important economic, cultural and ecological values. It is of great scientific and biological importance, maintaining an assemblage of vegetation communities found nowhere else in the world. It is one of the few alpine regions in the world with deep loamy soils, and contains endemic flora and fauna and some of the few periglacial and glacial features in Australia. The area also forms the core of the Australian mainland's most important water catchment and is a popular tourist destination, offering a range of recreational opportunities. The vegetation of the Kosciuszko alpine zone is recovering from impacts of livestock grazing and is increasingly exposed to pressures from tourism and anthropogenic climate change. At the same time, natural disturbances such as drought and fire can influence the distribution, composition and diversity of plants. Thus, there is a need for detailed environmental data on this area in order to: (1) better understand ecological relationships; (2) understand existing and potential effects of recreational and management pressures on the region; (3) provide data against which future changes can be assessed; and (4) provide better information on many features of this area, including vegetation, for interpretation, education and management. The research in this thesis utilised three types of ecological information: (1) scientific long-term datasets; (2) photographic records; and (3) a comparison of disturbed and undisturbed vegetation. This research analysed data from one of the longest ongoing monitoring programs in the Australian Alps established by Alec Costin and Dane Wimbush in 1959. Permanent plots (6 transects and 30 photoquadrats) were established at two locations that differed in the time since grazing and have been repeatedly surveyed. Plots near Mt Kosciuszko had not been grazed for 15 years and had nearly complete vegetation cover in 1959, while plots near Mt Gungartan showed extensive impacts of grazing and associated activities which only ceased in 1958. Some transect data from 1959 to 1978 have been analysed by the original researchers. The research presented in this thesis extends this monitoring program with data from additional surveys in 1990, 1999 and 2002 and applies current methods of statistical evaluation, such as ordination techniques, to the whole data set for the first time. Results indicated that the recovery from livestock grazing and the effects of drought have been the main factors affecting vegetation. Recovery from livestock grazing at the three transects at Gungartan was slow and involved: (1) increasing genera diversity; (2) increasing vegetation cover; (3) decreasing amounts of bare ground; and (4) a directional change over time in species composition. Patterns of colonisation and species succession were also documented. In 2002, 44 years after the cessation of grazing, transects near Mt Gungartan had similar vegetation cover and genera diversity to the transects near Mt Kosciuszko, but cover by exposed rock remained higher. A drought in the 1960s resulted in a temporary increase of litter and a shift in the proportional cover of life forms, as grasses died and herb cover increased at both locations. Proportions of cover for life forms reverted to pre-drought levels within a few years. The results also highlighted the spatial variability of tall alpine herbfield. The photoquadrats were surveyed in the years 1959, 1964, 1968, 1978 and 2001 and are analysed for the first time in this thesis. After comparing a range of methods, visual assessment using a 130 point grid was found to be the most suitable technique to measure vegetation cover and genera diversity. At the 18 quadrats near Mt Gungartan, there was a pattern of increasing vegetation cover as bare areas were colonised by native cudweeds and the naturalized herb Acetosella vulgaris. Revegetation from within bare areas largely occurred by herb species, while graminoids and shrub species predominately colonised bare ground by lateral expansion from the edges, eventually replacing the colonising herbs. At the 12 quadrats near Mt Kosciuszko, vegetation cover was almost complete in all years surveyed except 1968, which was at the end of a six year drought. Similar to the results from the transect study, the drought caused an increase in litter at both locations as graminoid cover declined. Initially herb cover increased, potentially as a result of decreased competition from the graminoids and a nutrient spike from decaying litter, but as the drought became more severe, herb cover also declined. Graminoid cover rapidly recovered after the drought, reaching pre-drought levels by 1978, and was at similar levels in 2001. Herb cover continued to decline after peaking in 1964. The photoquadrat study also documented the longevity and growth rates of several species indicating that many taxa may persist for several decades. It further provided insights into replacement patterns amongst life forms. In addition to assessing vegetation change following livestock grazing and drought at the long-term plots, recovery from tourism impacts was examined by comparing vegetation and soils on a closed walking track, with that of adjacent undisturbed tall alpine herbfield at a series of 22 paired quadrats. Fifteen years after the track was closed there was limited success in restoration. Over a quarter of the closed track was still bare ground with non-native species the dominant vegetation. Plant species composition differed and vegetation height, soil nutrients and soil moisture were lower on the track which had a higher compaction level than adjacent natural vegetation. The results presented in this thesis highlight that tall alpine herbfield is characterised by nearly entire vegetation cover which is dominated by graminoids, followed by herbs and shrubs in the absence of disturbance by livestock grazing, trampling or drought. The studies also showed that under quot;average" conditions, the relative cover of herbs and graminoids remained fairly stable even though there can be considerable cycling between them. Spatial variability in terms of taxa composition was high. The only common introduced species in unrehabilitated sites was Acetosella vulgaris, which was effective at colonising bare ground but was eventually replaced by other native species. However, in areas actively rehabilitated, such as on the closed track, non-native species introduced during revegetation efforts still persist with high cover 15 years after their introduction. Monitoring of vegetation change is also important at the landscape scale. This thesis provides a review of the potential use, the limitations and the benefits of aerial photography to examine vegetation change in the Kosciuszko alpine zone. Numerous aerial photography runs have been flown over the area since the 1930s for government agencies, industry and the military. Some of these records have been used to map vegetation communities and eroding areas at a point in time. Other studies compared different types and scales of photographs, highlighting in particular the benefits and potential of large scale colour aerial photography to map alpine vegetation. However, despite their potential to assess vegetation change over time, a temporal comparison of vegetation in the Kosciuszko alpine zone from aerial photographs has not been completed to this date. Historical photographs may not be easy to locate or access and difficulties with vegetation classification may restrict the practicality of using historical aerial photographs to assess vegetation change. Despite these issues, aerial photography may provide a very useful and efficient tool to assess changes over time when applied appropriately, even in alpine environments. The development of digital classification techniques, the application of statistical measures of error to both methodology and data, and the application of geographic information systems are likely to further improve the practicality of historical aerial photographs for the detection of vegetation change and assist in overcoming some of the limitations. The results presented in this thesis highlight the need for limiting disturbance, for ongoing rehabilitation of disturbed areas and for long-term monitoring in the Kosciuszko alpine zone. The results contribute to our understanding of how vegetation may change in the future and may be affected by new land use activities and climate change. This type of information, which otherwise would require the establishment of long-term studies and years of monitoring, can assist land managers of this and other important protected areas. The study highlights how the use and expansion of already existing datasets to gather ecological information can save considerable money and time, providing valuable data for current and emerging issues.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kosciuszko</field><field name="subject">Gungartan</field><field name="subject">Mt</field><field name="subject">Mount</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian Alps</field><field name="subject">alpine zone</field><field name="subject">vegetation dynamics</field><field name="subject">vegetation change</field><field name="subject">vegetation communities</field><field name="subject">tall alpine herbfield</field><field name="subject">plant</field><field name="subject">plants</field><field name="subject">herb</field><field name="subject">herbs</field><field name="subject">ecological disturbances</field><field name="subject">anthropogenic disturbances</field><field name="subject">livestock</field><field name="subject">grazing</field><field name="subject">tourist</field><field name="subject">tourists</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">recovery</field><field name="subject">disturbance</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">drought</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">ecological</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040715.125310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Individual Differences in Additional Substance Use in a Methadone Maintained Population</field><field name="creator">Schlesinger, Carla M</field><field name="description">It is well established that methadone maintenance (MM) reduces but does not eliminate the self-administration of other illicit drugs. For those on MM, there is considerable variation in consumption patterns, route of heroin administration, additional non-opioid substances routinely administered and the clinical disorders associated with these patterns of use. While there is a large literature base documenting these phenomena, studies have been almost exclusively descriptive in nature, with little attempt to develop a theoretical model in which to understand such use. In the following thesis, a model proposed by Gray was tested, the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST). This biopsychosocial model broadly describes two action tendencies; approach (Behavioural Activation System) and avoidance or withdrawal (Flight Fight Freeze System and the Behavioural Inhibition System). The model proposes that a heightened sensitivity to punishment underlies anxiety disorders. Conversely, a heightened sensitivity to rewarding stimuli may predispose some individuals to engage in highly rewarding behaviour and is associated with conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder. According to the Joint Subsystems Hypothesis, these personality styles are mutually dependent, whereby BIS and BAS interact to influence reward mediated and punishment mediated behaviours. Based on Gray's model, this thesis tests whether opiate dependent individuals with heightened sensitivity to punishment are more likely to use anxiolytic drugs (such as benzodiazepines), and individuals with heightened reward sensitivity will show a preference for substances that have high reward potential (such as stimulants). At time one, the participant sample (N= 120) comprised 71 males (59%) and 49 females who were opioid dependent and recruitment took place over an eight-month period in two city opioid replacement clinics. A range of measures was administered to assess substance use, mood, anxiety and the personality dimensions of reward sensitivity and punishment sensitivity, with substance use again measured at three months. Results of the first study suggested that a large proportion of the variance was accounted for by personality within the models. A total of 98 participants (81%) participated in the 12-week follow-up study. Sensitivity to punishment and reward significantly predicted drug preference. Although psychopathology symptoms were not able to moderate the relationship between personality and drug use, anxiety symptoms negatively mediated the relationship between punishment sensitivity and anxiolytic use, whereby the relationship became non-significant. In contrast, sensitivity to reward remained the strongest predictor of amphetamine use over antisocial characteristics. Individual differences were not able to predict treatment retention nor susceptibility to relapse during a 12-week initiation to a MM programme.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Methadone maintenance</field><field name="subject">reinforcement sensitivity theory</field><field name="subject">behavioural activation system</field><field name="subject">flight fight freeze system</field><field name="subject">behavioural inhibition system</field><field name="subject">joint subsystems hypothesis</field><field name="subject">drug addiction</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061109.150823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical Realization of Switched and Adaptive Parasitic Monopole Radiating Structures</field><field name="creator">Schlub, Robert Walter</field><field name="description">Switched and adaptive parasitic monopole array radiating structures are investigated. Antenna design is orientated toward increasing practicability for implementation in terrestrial wireless communication systems. A number of antennas are designed with the aid of optimization and commercial simulation software. Simulation procedure was verified with the experimental manufacture and measurement of the arrays. The antennas presented in this thesis comprise an active monopole surrounded by a ring of parasitic monopoles. Parasitic radiators are constructed with static loading to enable simple experimental realization. Beam positions of an electrically steered equivalent antenna are thus simulated. Antenna symmetry ensures the beam can be reproduced throughout the azimuth. Complex antenna geometries require antenna design through optimization. A genetic algorithm is employed with HFSS and NEC for electromagnetic analysis. The robust optimization method couples with simulation software flexibility to provide an effective design tool for arbitrary structures. The genetic algorithm is employed strictly for design and not complete structural optimization. Dual band, five and six element switched parasitic antennas are presented. Lumped elemental loading along the radiators provide resonance and directed radiation at two GSM frequencies. Load value, radiator dimension and spacing are incorporated as design parameters. Experimentally built, 10dB return loss bandwidths of 17.2% and 9.6% and front to back ratios of 12.6dB and 8.4dB at 900MHz and 1900MHz respectively are measured. To reduce the ground requirements of monopole arrays, a skirted ground structure for switched parasitic antennas is analyzed. A six element switched parasitic monopole array with conductive ground skirt exhibits a front to back ratio of 10.7dB and main lobe gain of 6.4dBi at 1.575GHz. Radiation is not elevated despite lateral ground terminating at the parasitic elements. Skirt height is observed to linearly control radiation elevation, depressing the principal lobe through 40 degrees from 23 degrees above the horizontal. The Electronically Steerable Passive Array Radiator or ESPAR antenna is an adaptive parasitic monopole array. An ESPAR radiating structure incorporating a conductive ground skirt is designed for operation at 2.4GHz. Utility is confirmed with a frequency sensitivity analysis showing consistent electrical characteristics over an 8.1% bandwidth. The antenna design is improved with optimization to reduce average principal lobe elevation from 25 degrees to 9.7 degrees.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antenna</field><field name="subject">antennas</field><field name="subject">antennae</field><field name="subject">parasitic</field><field name="subject">switched</field><field name="subject">adaptive</field><field name="subject">monopole</field><field name="subject">monopoles</field><field name="subject">radiating</field><field name="subject">radiators</field><field name="subject">optimization</field><field name="subject">microelectronics</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040610.112148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being, Becoming and Belonging: The Phenomenological Essence of Spiritual Leisure Experiences</field><field name="creator">Schmidt, Christopher Michael</field><field name="description">This study reports on an investigation into individuals&#146; experiences of spiritual leisure. Though there is a range of literature and research that examines the independent concepts of leisure and spirituality, there continues to be a lack of empirical research into the existence and experience of leisure that may be spiritual. Given that both traditional and ongoing understandings of leisure emphasise their impact on the whole of the person, this lack of attention to the spiritual dimension creates a gap in our understanding.  Leisure is increasingly seen as having a role to play in human well-being. What is less well known is the role and place of spirituality in that interplay. It is recognised that a sense of spirituality can be accessed in a diversity of ways, through, for example prayer, meditation and an engagement with sacred places. The spiritual forum of leisure however, remains less acknowledged and understood despite the fact that spiritual benefits have been identified as part of leisure participation. The purpose of this study was to develop insight into the existence and nature of this relationship by exploring the phenomenon of spiritual leisure experiences. As a primary research focus, this topic is rarely directly considered. Rather it is most often raised as an anecdotal benefit of leisure, a philosophical potential for leisure, or more recently, a component of people&#146;s spiritual and general well-being. Based on personal interest, informed by intuition and grounded in the theoretical and philosophical concepts of leisure and spirituality, this study sought to fill some gaps in our understandings of spiritual leisure experiences. Using a phenomenological approach, this descriptive, qualitative study aimed to explore the subjective meanings individuals give to experiences they refer to as spiritual leisure. Thus, 24 co-researchers were invited to share their self-defined spiritual leisure experiences, through open, unstructured interviews and reflective journaling. The leisure experiences the co-researchers described as spiritual occurred within various locations and involved multiple contexts. These included social and solo experiences, nature based or urban environments and active or passive pursuits. Reflective of what happened, the descriptions of the co-researchers revealed that spiritual leisure experiences could vary in situation, conditions, activity and contexts. The meanings behind these descriptions were also sought and three groupings of common themes were recognised: namely triggers; responses and outcomes. These structural components of spiritual leisure were interrelated in the co-researchers conscious understandings and represented a suite of feelings, thoughts, sensations and meanings embedded in the context, actions and locations of their leisure. Finally, the research included an exploration of the underlying essences of the experiences. Five interrelated essences of spiritual leisure emerged representing the phenomenon of spiritual leisure. These were: experiencing self; time and space for self; being; becoming; and belonging. Overall, the results demonstrated that experiences of leisure that were spiritual were evident for the 24 co-researchers. The experience of spiritual leisure was understood as an event that was lived physically, emotionally and affectively and while it varied in context it also shared the characteristics of providing a forum for knowing, being and becoming more of the self. In spiritual leisure, individuals found a life-space in which to discover and know aspects of themselves and to feel a sense of belonging. This study clearly identifies leisure as a valuable and edifying aspect of some people&#146;s lives in relation to developing their spiritual self or for experiencing their spirituality. The essential themes remind us of the true potential leisure can have in people&#146;s lives. More broadly, the study acknowledges the nature of spiritual leisure, its structural components and the value of studying the phenomenon from the perspective of the experiencing person.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spiritual leisure experiences</field><field name="subject">experiencing self</field><field name="subject">time and space for self</field><field name="subject">being</field><field name="subject">becoming</field><field name="subject">belonging</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060717.160259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Nutrients on Aquatic Primary Production and Food Webs in Subtropical Streams of South East Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Schmitt, Andrea V</field><field name="description">The increasing world population and with it the increased pressure on food production are likely to challenge the availability of quality fresh water resources in the near future. To compound the looming water crisis, caused by an increased demand for water available for agricultural production, the quality of our fresh water resources is also likely to suffer from the consequences of increased population pressure, i.e. urbanization of land and growth of industries, and food production, i.e. agricultural use of land. Moreton Bay, South East Queensland, Australia, is listed under the United Nations Convention on Wetlands and is also a declared Marine Park. The Moreton Bay area, however, is already one of the five fastest growing urban areas in the developed world. Prognoses about future population growth and urban and industrial development in the area, have hence given rise to growing concerns about the future water quality in this international environmentally important area. Therefore the aim of the current study was to investigate the fate of nutrients in freshwater streams in the Moreton Bay area in order to gain a better understanding of nutrient pathways in aquatic systems and assist in refining the National Water Quality Management Strategy to provide better management of our waterways. To achieve this, the effects of land use on water quality were determined at 22 study sites in the Brisbane River Catchment. Within the catchment five main types of land use were identified, including urban, rural residential, cropping, grazing and mixed types of land use. Water quality was sampled during three seasons: the pre-wet (October - November), wet (December - March) and dry (April - August) season. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in ambient stream water varied significantly spatially, i.e. types of land use, and temporally, i.e. seasons. At some sites, during certain times of the year, nutrient concentrations were found to exceed the range recommended by the Australian Water Quality guidelines. Nutrient concentrations were particular high in urban areas, especially during the dry season. It was also found that the 15N signatures in aquatic plants, i.e epipelic algae, correlated strongly with in-stream nitrogen concentrations. The large variability of in-stream nutrient concentrations, and the related changes in nitrogen isotopic signatures in aquatic plants, made it obvious to suggest that changes in land use may significantly impact on water quality in the catchment. Other changes in land use, for example riparian vegetation clearing, are also commonly observed in areas under urban, industry and/or agricultural growth pressure. This is of particular concern, given riparian vegetation is important not only in controlling nutrient and other organic matter input into streams, but also in regulating light levels for in-stream primary production. Previously riparian zones have been shown to be a prime source of carbon and energy for aquatic food webs in some studies, whereas other studies suggested the main driver of food webs is in-stream primary production. The current study used stable isotope analysis track carbon and nitrogen pathways through aquatic systems and determine the primary source of carbon and energy in aquatic food webs. Despite large spatial and temporal variability of 13C, aquatic consumers were closely tracking the carbon isotope signatures of plants and it was suggested that epilithic and epipelic algae are the main contributors to the carbon and energy budget of aquatic consumers.In realizing this importance of algae in aquatic systems, the next step in this study was to examine the relative importance of light and nutrient availability to periphyton and the effects of changes of these variables on plant biomass and primary production. In an in-situ experiment the levels of light and nutrients available to periphyton, were altered. Although nutrients and light may have colimited standing crop of periphyton, other variables were clearly limited by light. Parallel to this experiment on periphyton, the nutrient availability to Vallisneria spp. was experimentally altered to investigate the effects of changes in nutrient availability and nutrient limitation on other aquatic plants. The biomass of this submerged macrophyte increased three-fold in nitrogen and phosphorus sufficient areas over nutrient limited treatments. The physiological response, i.e. changes in concentrations of amino acids, of periphyton to changes in environmental conditions was also investigated on a large scale, i.e. spatial and temporal variability of amino acids, and a local scale, i.e. amino acid changes in artificially altered light and nutrient availability. This response was of particular interest in this study, as it was previously shown that physiological changes in plants impact on the quality of plants as food for consumers. The physiological changes in aquatic plants could thus provide an important link between nutrient input into streams (e.g. from terrestrial sources), impacts on aquatic plants (e.g.. nutrient uptake and physiological responses in plants) and effects on aquatic consumers (e.g. changes in food quality of plants and therefore impacts on biomass, growth and overall health of aquatic consumers).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">In-stream nutrient concentrations</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay (Queensland)</field><field name="subject">freshwater streams</field><field name="subject">riparian vegetation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061010.135700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cloning and Characterisation of the Human SinRIP Proteins</field><field name="creator">Schroder, Wayne Ashley</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the cloning and characterisation of a novel human gene and its protein products, which have been designated SAPK- and Ras-interacting protein (SinRIP). SinRIP shares identity with JC310, a partial human cDNA that was previously identified a candidate Ras-inhibitor (Colicelli et al., 1991, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88, p. 2913). In this study, it was shown that SinRIP is a member of an orthologous family of proteins that is conserved from yeast to mammals and contains proteins involved in Ras- and SAPK-mediated signalling pathways. Comparison of this family of proteins showed that human SinRIP contains a potential Ras-binding domain (RBD; residues 279-354), a PH-like domain (PHL; 376-487), and a highly conserved novel region designated the CRIM (134-265). Several other potential targeting sites, such as nuclear localisation signals and target sites for kinases, were identified within the SinRIP sequence.  The human SinRIP gene is unusually large (&gt;280 kbp) and is located on chromosome 9 at 9q34. SinRIP mRNA was detected in a wide variety of tissue-types and cell lines by RT-PCR, and the SinRIP sequences in the EST database were derived from an diverse array of tissues, suggesting a widespread or ubiquitous expression. Northern blot analysis revealed the highest levels in skeletal muscle and heart tissue. However, the steady-state levels of SinRIP mRNA vary greatly from cell to cell, and SinRIP expression is likely to be regulated at multiple post-transcriptional levels. It was shown that SinRIP mRNA is likely to be translated inefficiently by the normal cap-scanning mechanism, due to the presence of a GC-rich and structured 5&#146;-UTR, which also contains upstream ORFs. Alternative polyadenylation signals in the SinRIP 3&#146;-UTR can be used, resulting in the expression of short and long SinRIP mRNA isoforms. Several potential A/T-rich regulatory elements were also identified in SinRIP mRNA, which may target specific SinRIP mRNA isoforms for rapid degradation.  Importantly, it was shown that SinRIP mRNA is alternatively spliced, resulting in the production of distinct SinRIP protein isoforms. Three isoforms, SinRIP2-4, were definitively identified by RT-PCR and full-length cloning. The SinRIP isoforms contain deletions in conserved regions, and are likely to have biochemical characteristics that are different to full-length SinRIP1. SinRIP2 is C-terminally truncated and lacks the PHL domain and part of the RBD, and relatively high levels of SinRIP2 expression arelikely to occur in kidneys. The RBD is disrupted in SinRIP3, but all other domains are intact, and RT-PCR analyses suggest that SinRIP3 is present in some cells at levels comparable to SinRIP1. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum against SinRIP was generated and detected endogenous SinRIP proteins. Using the anti-SinRIP antibody in immunoblots, multiple SinRIP isoforms were observed in most cell types. SinRIP1 and another endogenous SinRIP protein, likely to be SinRIP3, were detected in most cell lines, and appear to be are the major SinRIP proteins expressed in most cells. The subcellular localisation of both recombinant and endogenous SinRIP proteins was investigated by immunofluorescence assays and biochemical fractionation. Recombinant SinRIP1 protein was found in the cytoplasm and associated with the plasma membrane. In contrast, the SinRIP2 protein was predominantly nuclear, with only low-level cytoplasmic staining observed. The endogenous SinRIP proteins, likely to comprise these and other SinRIP isoforms, were found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. SinRIP1 interacted with GTP-bound (active) Ras, but not GDP-bound (inactive) Ras, in an in vitro assay, and also co-localised with activated H- and K-Ras in cells. The binding profile observed is typical of Ras-effectors, and SinRIP did not inhibit signalling by the Ras proteins, suggesting that it is not likely to be a Ras-inhibitor. It was also shown that SinRIP1 and SinRIP2 both interact and colocalise with c-Jun NH2- terminal kinase (JNK). Both SinRIP proteins were able to recruit JNK to their respective sub-cellular compartments. These interactions suggest an adaptor role for SinRIP in the Ras and/or JNK pathways. In addition, Sam68 was isolated as a SinRIP-binding protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Sam68 was shown to colocalise with SinRIP2 and endogenous SinRIP proteins, but not SinRIP1. Further colocalisation studies showed that endogenous SinRIP proteins localise in nuclear structures that may be associated with pre-mRNA splicing. Likely functions for SinRIP, as indicated by experimental results and studies of the orthologues of SinRIP in other species, are discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SAPK</field><field name="subject">SAPK-interacting protein</field><field name="subject">stress activated protein kinase</field><field name="subject">Ras proteins</field><field name="subject">Ras-interacting protein</field><field name="subject">stress activated protein kinase</field><field name="subject">SinRIP</field><field name="subject">SinRIP gene</field><field name="subject">protein binding</field><field name="subject">gene cloning</field><field name="subject">molecular cloning</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030829.140754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attachment Style and Chronic Pain Syndrome: The Importance of Psychological and Social Variables in the Biopsychosocial Model of Chronic Pain</field><field name="creator">Scott, Suzanne</field><field name="description">The current research examined the proposition that individuals who were securely attached had a fundamentally different reaction and experience of chronic pain to the experience of individuals with an insecure attachment style.  A biopsychosocial model of chronic pain was created that included the variables of attachment style, pain, depression, anxiety, somatisation, quality of life, function, disability, neuroticism, age and gender.  Three cross-sectional quantitative studies and one qualitative study were conducted.  Participants were (a) patients from a multidisciplinary pain centre in a major public hospital, and (b) members of the general population with chronic pain who were recruited from both urban and rural settings, across various community support groups.  The total sample was 470.  Instruments for the quantitative studies included the Revised Adult Attachment Scale (Collins &amp; Read, 1990), the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Melzack, 1975), the Pain Patient Profile (Tollinson &amp; Langley, 1992), the Quality of Life Inventory (Frisch, 1994), the International Association for the Study of Pain Assessment Protocol (International Association for the Study of Pain, 1986), the Migraine Disability Scale (Stewart, Lipton, Kolodner, Liebermann, &amp; Sawyer, 1999), and the short form of the Eysenck Neuroticism Scale (Eysenck, Eysenck, &amp; Barret, 1985). The clinical and non-clinical participants with a diagnosis of chronic pain syndrome were partitioned as securely or insecurely attached.  In the clinical sample, the proportion of securely attached individuals was less than one quarter of the group, while in the non-clinical sample the proportion of individuals in the securely attached group was 50%.  For Study 1, (200 individuals from the clinical sample), the groups were partitioned using the classification criteria of Collins and Read (1990).  Securely attached participants = 27%, insecurely attached 73%.  An analysis of effect of attachment style on overall pain showed that the Securely Attached group reported less overall pain than the Insecurely Attached group. For Study 2, (using the total clinical sample), the sample comprised 27.3% securely attached and 72.7% insecurely attached participants.  The Securely Attached group reported less overall Pain, less Negative Affect and Somatisation than the Insecurely Attached group, and higher levels of Quality of Life.  Somatisation provided a significant unique contribution of variance to predicting overall Pain, providing some support for the biopsychosocial model, and Negative Affect (Depression and Anxiety combined) made a significant unique contribution to Quality of Life, explaining 26% of the variance.  Gender was unrelated to any variable. For Study 3, the sample consisted of rural and urban participants, and the rural group was significantly older than the urban group. No other differences were found. The groups were combined to form the non-clinical group.  The group was evenly divided (50%) between securely and insecurely attached groups.  Gender was unrelated to any variable.  For the non-clinical group, using the variables investigated in Study 2, there was no difference on overall pain scores, but negative affect and somatisation were higher and quality of life lower in the insecure group than in the secure group. No differences were found on Pain Intensity but Pain Pattern differed between the groups. Three new variables were added to the model - Neuroticism, Function and Disability.  Disability and Function were significantly different between the attachment style groups.  Age was significantly related to lower pain scores, less loss of function, less disability and higher quality of life.  Pain scores were most related to somatisation, with age and quality of life contributing significant variance.  Neuroticism added further to this explanation.  Negative Affect made the most contribution to the variance explained in quality of life, and neuroticism and function made no significant contribution.  Neuroticism and Attachment Style contributed significant amounts of variance to Function.  To compare the Secure and Insecure Attachment groups in the Clinical and Non-clinical samples, a matched groups study, N = 190, was conducted.  Clinical and non-clinical participants were matched for Age, Gender and Attachment Style.  No differences were reported on overall pain between the attachment groups, but differences existed on negative affect, somatisation and quality of life.  For sample type, the clinical group reported higher overall pain scores, less negative affect and less somatisation, but no differences were found on quality of life, compared to the non-clinical group. Study 4 was a qualitative study that used structured interviews of 24 clinical and non-clinical participants matched for age, gender, attachment style and etiology.  The securely attached group reported having extensive, positive social support, high community involvement and appropriate reliance on medical and allied health care and medications.  The insecurely attached group reported more problems with physical pain and psychological distress, less social support, less function and more perceived disability.  The insecurely attached group reported more use of medical, allied and alternative health resources.  Older securely attached individuals reported the lowest overall pain scores and the highest quality of life.  These results support the hypotheses that a secure attachment style contributes to more positive outcomes for individuals with chronic pain syndrome and were consistent with a model of chronic pain that includes biological, psychological and social variables.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attachment style and chronic pain syndrome</field><field name="subject">biopsychosocial model of chronic pain</field><field name="subject">attachment behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070326.114910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching and Learning in Internet Environments in Australian Nursing Education</field><field name="creator">Seaton-Sykes, Philippa</field><field name="description">Since the introduction of the Internet, there has been an increase in the adoption of this technology for educational purposes. This development and widespread availability of Internet technologies, alterations in the needs of clinical practice and the characteristics of students, have all inspired changes in nursing education (Mallow &amp; Gilje, 1999). In response, nursing education has embraced the opportunity this communication medium offers to the diverse groups of students in nursing. These students may be studying at a distance, or due to other constraints such as time or professional commitments, studying in flexible ways where students may or may not be in the classroom. In other instances, Internet technologies are being used with the aim of enriching learning in nursing. However, despite widespread development and implementation of these innovations, the effects on nursing education have not been extensively researched (Cheek, Gilham &amp; Mills, 1998; Gillham, 2002; Mallow &amp; Gilje, 1999) and little is known about how the Internet contributes to teaching and learning, what learning outcomes are, or what support is required by teachers and students (Billings, 2000).  At this time of rapid development of Internet-based and Internet-supported courses in the Australian nursing education system, there is a need to ensure such courses are educationally effective, clinically relevant, and that resources are appropriately assigned.  This exploratory study aimed to contribute to effective discipline-specific use of internet learning environments through increased understanding of students&#146; and academics&#146; experiences of teaching practices and learning processes. There were two phases to this mixed-method study, a survey of course coordinators, and secondly, interviews with eleven students and sixteen academics. The survey of diverse schools of nursing across Australia provided foundational information about the ways the Internet was integrated into nursing education, and the preparation and supports that were offered to students for Internet-based or Internet-supported learning. Guided by a constructivist theoretical framework, and analysed thematically, the key findings of this study were drawn from the academics&#146; and students&#146; experiences in a variety of nursing courses in universities located across Australia. The Internet was employed in these courses in a variety of ways. At the time of data collection for both the survey and the interviews, more courses were Internet-supported than Internet-based. A variety of Internet information and communication features were used in courses.  The survey findings provided both a context for the interview findings, and a degree of confirmation of these findings. The context reported was diverse, consistent with an emergent educational environment that has few precedents to guide its implementation. The academics&#146; experiences revealed that teaching in online environments was vastly different to face-to-face teaching and required different practices of teaching and learning that took into consideration the separation of teachers from learners, and learners from each other. While often enthusiastic about the new environment, many teachers needed specific preparation, support, and adequate resources to teach in this new environment. Similarly, students experienced a dislocation from the learning environments to which they were accustomed. Significant shifts were apparent in the students&#146; constructions of both individual and collaborative learning that were contingent upon the separation of teachers and learners, and the necessity of communicating in a written medium.  Both teachers and learners revealed how, consequent upon their dislocation, they were relocating to a new interpretation of time, place and relationships in Internet learning environments, and were reconstructing teaching and learning. The reconstructions of learning included ways of relating that built learning communities predicated on a shift in focus from teaching to learning. These included both a shift in individual student&#146;s learning, and a constructed understanding that arose variously from shaping a fundamental comprehension or challenging thinking, to expand comprehension in the group. Through new understandings and practices, the participants were beginning to construct a place for students and teachers to realise the possibilities for enriched learning that online communities can provide. The findings of this study are discussed in terms of the possibilities for teaching and learning in nursing education, and recommendations are made.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">nursing education</field><field name="subject">nurse education</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">online learning</field><field name="subject">online teaching</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040218.122119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioprospecting and Access to Indigenous Flora: Policy Implications of Contested Ways of 'Knowing' and 'Owning'</field><field name="creator">Seini, Monica Michelle</field><field name="description">This thesis critically explores the issue of access to biological resources and Indigenous knowledge Historically, biological resources collected and documented, and knowledge associated with their use, have been considered the 'common heritage of mankind' The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) changed this understanding to tights of states over biological resources, but also gave rise to issues of equity and justice, especially with regard to Indigenous Nations encapsulated within First World states-so-called 'Fourth World Nations', A central concern of Fourth World Peoples is their marginalisation within access negotiations, despite their claims of connate (birth) rights to r esou.r ces and knowledge they identify as their own. Increasing global Indigenous activism over their concerns, has in turn raised an increasingly important policy gap that is becoming recognised in fora and processes with regard to access to biological resources. My thesis addresses this policy gap. I explore some of the complex historical, political and cultural dimensions that led to the emergence and resilience of this policy problem The failure to address the concerns of Indigenous peoples, and Fourth World Nations in particular, is more important and problematic now because of contemporary biotechnological developments and the emergence of bioprospecting. Bioprospecthg refers to the practice of appropriating biological resources, and Indigenous knowledge of those resources, and incorporating them into biopharmaceutical processes. Literature on bioprospecting as a problematic issue for Third World States has been emerging steadily over the last decade under the impact of the commercialisation of biodiversity, which has become big business for biopha.rmaceutical companies. The unique interests and experiences of Fourth World Nations are not recognised within this literature as significantly different to that of the Third World, and of their encapsulating states.. This study has addressed this significant gap by utilising and developing an analytical approach that uses Fourth World theory, synthesised with elements of Foucault's analytics of power. When combined, these two theoretical approaches provide a new and rich under standing of how dominant 'ways of knowing' and 'ways of owning' have been privileged, while other knowledge and ownership systems have been, and continue to be, marginalised, Eoucault's understanding of discursive power as having the capability to be either, or both, dominant and resistant is important to my analysis, as it accommodates the Fourth World as a discursive site of resistance to dominant power. I posit that richer insights are gained through the development and application of this theoretical framework to the issue of fair and equitable access to biological resources, than other approaches offer. I demonstrate the framework's utility by applying it to a case study on bioprospecting in Australia. Important findings have emerged while tracking the activities of Fourth World peoples on the international stage, and their attempts to challenge dominant power/knowledge structures within political institutions For example, participation at the international level has enabled Fomth World peoples to apply pressure on their encapsulating states to accommodate their interests. This has been furthered through forming alliances with, for example, environmentalists, and through the adoption of the language of effective participation within international fora.. Overall, however, the study found that the participation of Eourth World peoples within international, central state and local state policy processes is not always empowering in challenging dominant interests Instead, the more accurate impression is that at this stage of the discursive policy terrain, it may only create an illusion of participation that actually serves to entrench their disempowerment. This places pressule on policy processes to address and resolve this access issue equitably if social turbulence is to subside, justice be served, and certainty provided for all.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioprospecting</field><field name="subject">indigenous flora</field><field name="subject">biological resources</field><field name="subject">Indigenous knowledge</field><field name="subject">ways of knowing</field><field name="subject">ways of owning</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060302.122535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shall I stay?: The Meaning of Working to Older Workers in an Organisational Setting</field><field name="creator">Shacklock, Kate Herring</field><field name="description">Australia's population and workforce are ageing.  The reason for an ageing population is the post World War II baby boom, followed by low birth rates in subsequent generations.  Combined with healthier lifestyles, advances in medical science and the subsequent increase in longevity, this means that there are more older people than ever before and this trend will continue for several more decades.  However, workforce demographics are also affected by ageing, and Australian organisations will need to employ more older workers in the near future to meet predicted shortfalls of skilled workers. Although there have been studies examining the current low employment rates of older workers, the identification of negative stereotypes associated with older workers, and related problems and challenges (such as age discrimination), no study of the working intentions of older Australian workers has been reported.  Therefore, the aim of this research is to explore the meaning of working for older workers to better understand whether and why older Australian workers might want to continue working.  In particular, this thesis explores what it is about working that makes some people want to continue beyond the traditional age of retirement, while others wish to cease work as soon as they are able.  There are clear implications for individuals, organisations and public policy emanating from the extension to working lives. The research aims and objectives were best met within a phenomenological approach, and the data collection consisted of four studies.  The setting for the research was a single organisation; an Australian university.  Three of these studies were qualitatively-driven, within an interpretivist paradigm: (i) in-depth interviews with older employees (aged 50 years or older) to determine their meanings of working; (ii) interviews with managers to determine whether there were any organisational factors encouraging older workers to retire early; and (iii) interviews with retirees to determine their meanings of working and retirement.  The fourth study was quantitative and examined the demographics of the organisation and the relevant HRM policy documents. The thesis uses the meaning of working as the initial theoretical conceptual perspective, and derives a new conceptual perspective for managing older workers, which is outlined in the last chapters.  The research draws from two perspectives - the organisation and the individual.  The organisational perspective examines the management of organisational staffing in the context of future demographic changes.  The individual perspective is explored via the meaning of working to older workers. The key findings from the research in the chosen university suggest that despite the Commonwealth Government's attempts to encourage older workers to continue working, the majority of the older workers, irrespective of employment category, did not want to continue working beyond the traditional retirement age of 65 years.  Reasons included wanting to spend more time with a life partner, becoming more involved with interests outside of work, and removing themselves from the negative circumstances in the organisation.  However, of those who wanted to continue working, the majority was from the academic employment category (both employees and retirees), and the minority was from the administrative or general employment category.  Additionally, the academic participants rated working in their lives as important or very important; higher than the ratings provided by the general staff participants.  Explanations are offered as to reasons for such differences between the employment categories. The consequences of these findings include the need for a new approach to managing older workers, and particularly at the end of their working lives and into retirement.  Australian organisations cannot afford to continue losing staff to early retirement, yet this trend appears to continue.  Suggestions to meet this challenge are made at three levels: public policy, the organisation and the individual.  Implications for future research are presented in the final chapter.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Older workers</field><field name="subject">ageing workforce</field><field name="subject">skilled workforce</field><field name="subject">ageing population</field><field name="subject">traditional retirement</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060818.144021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consumer Decision-Making: An Empirical Exploration of Multi-Phased Decision Processes</field><field name="creator">Shao, Wei</field><field name="description">Over the past 50 years, a great deal of research has conceptualised and modelled consumer decision-making as a single-or two-stage decision process. Today, the decision complexity has increased and consumers need to filter out a large amount of information prior to the final choice decision. This poses a challenge for marketing modellers to develop decision models that are more representative of real-world decision-making. An important rationale for the present study is to improve our understanding of consumer decision-making by providing empirical evidence that consumer decision-making may go beyond a single-or two-stage structure. This thesis aims to provide an insightful view of consumer decision-making, which may help marketers to develop and reinforce marketing programs to address consumer needs and hence increase profits, with knowledge of the types of decisions made and how decisions are made at different stages of the decision process. The literature review identified single-and two-stage decision models. Data analysis did not fully support this conceptualisation. An empirical exploration of consumer decision-making for a durable product revealed that the existing literature is limited in scope and predictability as they failed to capture multi-phase decision processes, which accounted for approximately one-half of consumer decisions. Empirical evidence was found suggesting that consumers seldom use a single strategy throughout the decision process. Consumer heterogeneity was also evident in this research as different consumers approached the same decision task with different processes and outcomes. Finally, this research identified those aspects of decision processes that have not been captured by the literature-based decision strategies. This research suggests that consumer decisions are more contingent than previously conceived in a single-and two-stage model. This research recommends that marketers should reconsider their understanding of consumer decision-making and bear in mind that one marketing strategy does not fit all customers. Marketers need to develop marketing strategies to address the entire decision process instead of focusing only on the decision outcome. By identifying different decision paths that are used by consumers, marketers can effectively segment the market; marketers can also benchmark consumers' perceptions of their performance on the important attributes against competitors to ensure that their product/brand is not eliminated prior to the selection from within the choice set. Future research requires us to understand how consumer differences interact with the decision environment to influence decision processes and outcomes. To do so, researchers must adopt a multi-phase perspective.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consumer</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">phases</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="subject">heterogeneity</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070725.144459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To Market to Market: The Development of the Australian Children's Publishing Industry</field><field name="creator">Sheahan-Bright, Robyn</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to examine the tension between 'commerce and culture' in the dynamic development of the Australian children's publishing industry, within the wider context of international children's publishing history. It aims to refute a commonly stated 'truism' - that the conflict between the cultural value of a book and the need to market it threatens the integrity of the authors, publishers and the books themselves. Instead, it demonstrates that the tension between cultural and commercial definitions of the book publisher's role lies at the heart of the dynamism which has fuelled the development of a publishing climate, and created really innovative publishing. Publishing has too often been examined as if the sole motive of the publisher should be to produce books of quality, and though this is certainly the primary objective of the publishers which are the focus in this study, it is imperative to recognize that the dissemination of 'quality' literature and cultural product has always been dependent upon the recognition of commercial strategies which are often naively dismissed as being opportunistic and even extraneous to the publisher's purpose. As this thesis endeavours to show, the pioneering efforts of John Newbery, the Religious Tract Society, E.W. Cole, Ward, Lock &amp; Co., and Australia's first publisher Angus &amp; Robertson and of later publishers such as Penguin, Scholastic, Lothian, Omnibus, Allen &amp; Unwin and others, were founded just as much upon the shrewd recognition of a viable market as they were upon the aim to enrich young readers' lives. In fact it is the symbiotic partnership between these two objectives which has fuelled their successes and their failures. It is where publishers either steer a path paved only with good intentions or one paved entirely with gold that their enterprises generally falter. The study owes a significant debt to the achievements of those who have documented Australian children's publishing 'output' so assiduously - Maurice Saxby's groundbreaking histories (1969, 1971, 1993) and Marcie Muir and Kerry White's comprehensive bibliographical tools (1982, 1992). Contrary to those endeavours, though, this study'goes back-stage' to the area where the publishing 'action' happens. Consequently it does not provide a comprehensive overview of every publication or author; it does not cover every genre and style. Rather it is concerned to document the activities of publishers which have produced books for children in Australia, in brief, and to isolate key examples of publishing enterprises within this coverage which represent 'case studies' of the different types of companies which have played a successful part in publishing development. This work is intended to be of interest not simply to either children's literature or Australian literature theorists, but to book historians, and to media, cultural studies and entertainment industry theorists. It was based on a belief that cultural histories of this nature are valuable in tracking the growth of a society and also in demonstrating that creative endeavours are never simply that. They are the result of a complex interweaving of a variety of factors, and that therefore artists approach creativity 'at their peril' without first understanding something of the world into which they are entrusting their creations. Consequently there were several objectives in the study which were to: 1. contextualize Australian children's publishing within a history of children's publishing internationally, with particular reference to early commercial beginnings in Britain and to British Empire developments, but also with appropriate reference to growth in the USA; 2. contextualize Australian children's publishing within the broader range and expansion of the book publishing industry in Australia, particularly the latter's economic growth and cultural influence since WWII, but also including an overview of foundational developments from the nineteenth century; 3. contextualize Australian children's publishing within social, educational and cultural developments, such as the development of education programs, the expansion of public and school libraries, the changes in government policy related to children and books, shifting social attitudes towards the child, and the impact of entertainment and media industries; 4. examine the roles played by various individuals, especially publishers, managers, editors, marketers, booksellers, librarians, teachers and professional commentators in the development of the Australian children's publishing industry. Their roles will be analysed in the context of various industry-particular questions such as a) the oft-remarked upon tensions that exist in publishing, between for example, 'craft-like' and bureaucratic structures; b) the interplay between 'structure and agency' in the industry; c) the shift from a 'library market' to a 'mass market' under such influences as globalization and media; d) whether publishing is necessarily more 'Australian' if it is done by independent, rather than multinational companies; and e) the influence that the 'internal' structure of publishing has had on its development, e.g. the isolation of children's publishing from the mainstream, the predominance of women as agents in its development, and so on; 5. finally, discuss the implications of globalization since the 1970s, and posit future directions in the production, marketing and consumption of children's properties. This study examines the industry from a critical perspective relying not on the evaluation of quality as opposed to mass market literature, but viewing all forms of trade literature for children as part of a dynamic whole. It therefore traces the origins of publishing in English-language countries briefly first before examining the Australian situation, and shows that from the very beginning, publications for children have been the products of both altruistic and profit-driven objectives. It concentrates on the post-WWII period, on certain key enterprises and trends which have been particularly successful, suggesting that those publishing houses and those individuals within them who 'balance' commerce and culture with the most skill, are those who succeed in making 'good' books readily accessible to those for whom they have been created. This thesis celebrates the fact that children's publishers have always demonstrated an admirable combination of opportunism and idealism, the two characteristics which are essential to a successful publishing company. Australia has been fortunate in rearing several enterprising individuals whose early publishing attempts laid the ground for the currently successful houses. Without E.W. Cole, William Steele at Ward, Lock and Co., Frank Eyre at Oxford University Press, Andrew Fabinyi at Cheshire, Barbara Ker Wilson at Angus &amp; Robertson, Anne Bower Ingram at William Collins, the later successes of key individuals at Penguin Books Australia, Scholastic Australia, Allen &amp; Unwin, Lothian Books and Omnibus Books and countless others may not have been planted in such fertile ground. This study predicts that the future of Australian children's publishing lies in the recognition of the essential role played by commercial instincts in shaping cultural endeavours.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children's book publishing</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian publishing industry</field><field name="subject">children's publishing industry</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060127.123757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intercultural Personhood: A 'Mainstream' Australian Biographical Case Study</field><field name="creator">Shearer, Helen Dianne</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the question of intercultural personhood in two 'mainstream' Australian cases within interpersonal, intercultural relations in Australian contexts in the second half of the twentieth century.  The problem is viewed through three disciplinary lenses: those of communication, psychology and sociology.  A qualitative, interdisciplinary approach integrates these through an inductive biographical research design. Within cross-cultural communication studies, a host culture such as that of the Anglo-Australian majority is seen in a monolithic and static way to which Australians of other cultural backgrounds are seen to adapt.  These studies give no place to the changes which members of the majority undergo. 'Intercultural personhood', a term coined by Kim (1988, 2001), describes the kinds of 'ethnic' individuals who through negotiating their identities within personal, social and mass communication contexts, both host and ethnic, move beyond the bounds of their own cultural heritage to embrace both their former cultural identity and the new 'host' (viz Australian) identity. In this thesis, the elements of cross-cultural adaptation theory and of 'intercultural personhood' are applied to the intercultural experience of 'mainstream' Australians. From preliminary memory work workshops and focus groups, the cases of two mainstream individuals who show some evidence of 'intercultural personhood' and make identity claims comparable with 'ethnic' adapters are then developed through biographical method. Their life accounts are drawn on for the exploration of issues of identity and personhood within interpersonal, intercultural relations. Major focus is given to the social psychology of Harre (1983, 1993, 1998), whose work provided both a conceptualisation and a methodological tool for the problem. In Harre's work, three dimensions of personhood, namely consciousness, agency and biography are identified together with the psycho-social processes through which an individual's identity and orientation to their culture is appropriated, transformed and publicised. This publication is then rejected or incorporated into the culture through processes of conventionalisation. These four psycho-social processes are explored in my study through an adaptation of assisted biography method (De Waele &amp; Harre, 1979). The strength of the psycho-social approach of Harre lies in its ability to get below the surface behaviours to an analysis of the theory of self which individuals, as 'singular' beings, bring into play in their interactions within themselves and with one another. While this approach draws on social contexts to support the transformations, it is not designed to explicate to a sufficient degree the conditions under which such theories of self are activated and within which changes in identity occur and are maintained. For this reason it is essential to incorporate a sociological framework to understand the influence of the conditions within which such experiences are played out. Bourdieu's (1984, 1987) cultural, relational sociology is coupled with Harre's (1983, 1993, 1998) theory of personal and social being in that it brings together the individual and the society in a way which proves fruitful for ongoing analysis of the biographical data collected within the communication and psycho-social framework of the earlier research.  Bourdieu's critique of a methodology based on biography points to the 'illusion' that is created through a biographical interview process.  Taking this critique of biography into the study of interpersonal, intercultural relations meant a shift from the communication interactions and psycho-social analysis undertaken to an analysis of the various social constructions evident within the elements of the life account and a search for the cognitive imprint of social structures as durable dispositions within the persons.  These dispositions are evident from within a social trajectory of the life and they are applied to the intercultural encounters recounted by the participants in their autobiographies.  The addition of Bourdieu's (1984, 1987) sociology strengthens the ability to view the individual and the society through a single lens and to position the individual life course as secondary within a broader and primary analysis of social structure and social structuring as a means of interpreting lives.  Its weakness lies in the degree of 'voluntariness' brought into effect as individuals both chart their course through life and are pushed and pulled by the various social forces at work within their trajectories. Within the scope of this thesis, these two approaches, that is, a psychological and a sociological one, are illustrated and incorporated into an interdisciplinary model for the study of interpersonal, intercultural relations.  Further rigorous research to validate the components and the relationships of the model and to investigate these strengths and weaknesses more thoroughly is foreshadowed.  This interdisciplinary model of interpersonal, intercultural relations is the major contribution of this work to the field of intercultural communication.  Advances which are achieved through use of psychology, sociology and biographical research method as a tool through this study are also identified.  The thesis concludes with a review of the contributions of the thesis and a discussion of the implications for future research on interpersonal, intercultural relations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intercultural</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">social psychology</field><field name="subject">sociology</field><field name="subject">Rom Harre</field><field name="subject">Pierre Bourdieu</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">society</field><field name="subject">interpersonal relations</field><field name="subject">intercultural relations</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">ethnic</field><field name="subject">minority</field><field name="subject">minorities</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040921.082235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internet-Based Collaborative Programming Techniques and Environments</field><field name="creator">Shen, Haifeng</field><field name="description">Software systems are getting larger and more complex, while the requirements are becoming vaguer and more rapidly changing. These trends make current software development more and more likely a team work. To integrate multiple developers into a coherent structured management process and make team software development a positive-sum game for both higher productivity and better quality, many team soft ware development methodologies have been proposed and practised. An emerging methodology is collaborative programming, which allows a group of programmers to work together on the same source code for design, implementation of individual components, and integration of individual components. Compared with other team software methodologies that only address needs in some phases or situations, collaborative programming is more adaptive to the variety of different phases or situations in a team software development process. A core technical component in collaborative programming is collaborative editing, which allows a group of programmers to view and edit the same source code. To support different phases or situations in an Internet-based collaborative programming process, collaborative editing must meet the requirements of supporting unconstrained, responsive, real-time collaborative editing; unconstrained, syncretic, non-real-time collaborative editing; and smooth, flexible switching between real-time and non-real-time collaborative editing. This thesis research contributes several novel techniques to address these requirements, and an Internet-based collaborative programming environment to integrate those techniques. These research contributions have advanced state-of-the-art technologies on col laborative editing for supporting Internet-based collaborative programming. First, we contribute a collaborative highlighting gestural communication technique for unconstrained, responsive, real-time collaborative editing. This technique is particularly effective in improving the quality of real-time interaction on text-based source code documents. The contribution to the operational transformation technology is the extension of the technology to support group awareness. It includes a package of operational transformation functions and transformation control algorithms for consistency maintenance in collaborative highlighting, and a flexible undo solution that has the capability of undoing any highlighting operation at any time. Second, we contribute a flexible operation-based merging technique for unconstrained, syncretic, non-real-time collaborative editing, which is efficient and has the capability of textually integrating all changes, and automatically detecting and resolving syntactic conflicts according to application-dependent user-specified policies. The contribution to the operational transformation technology is the extension of the technology to support unconstrained, syncretic, non-real-time collaborative editing. Its includes a log compression algorithm, a textual merging algorithm, and a syntactic merging algorithm. Moreover, we contribute a flexible notification technique to support flexible collaborative editing: unconstrained, responsive, real-time collaborative editing; uncon strained, syncretic, non-real-time collaborative editing; and smooth, flexible switching between them. The contribution to the operational transformation technology is the extension of the technology to support flexible collaborative editing. It includes a new transformation control algorithm that has a linear time complexity, two notification algorithms that support propagation and acceptance of any notifications at any time, and a notification propagation protocol that is efficient for both real-time and non-real-time collaborative editing.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">software development</field><field name="subject">team software</field><field name="subject">collaborative programming</field><field name="subject">internet-based programming</field><field name="subject">editing</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031015.143156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Multi-Scale Approach to Defining Historical and Contemporary Factors Responsible for the Current Distribution of the White-bellied Sea-Eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster (Gmelin, 1788) in Australia</field><field name="creator">Shephard, Jill</field><field name="description">The White-bellied Sea-Eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster is widespread in Australia, but has been the subject of conservation concern due to suggested localised declines and extinctions. Regionalised monitoring programmes have addressed some aspects of local concern, however a broader approach is needed to gain an understanding of large-scale processes affecting long-term persistence at scales equivalent to the species Australian range.  Ultimately, the ability to predict change in population size over time accurately depends on the scale of analysis. By necessity, ecological studies using direct sampling techniques are often made across spatial scales smaller than a species geographic range and across relatively short time frames. This seems counter-intuitive considering that long-term species persistence is often dependent on large-scale processes.  The principal aim of this thesis was to identify historical and contemporary forces responsible for the current pattern of population structure in H. leucogaster. This required a multi-scale approach, and the resulting research uses genetic, distributional and morphometric data.  Haliaeetus leucogaster is a large territorial raptor that historically has been associated with coastal regions, lakes and perennial river systems. It has an extensive worldwide distribution from the western coast of India throughout the Indomalaysian region, Papua New Guinea and Australia. By virtue of the species' large-scale distribution, in Australia it is fairly cosmopolitan in its use of habitat and prey types.  Haliaeetus leucogaster is monomorphic for adult plumage colouration, but in body size displays reversed sexual dimorphism with female birds significantly larger. A discriminant function based on 10 morphometric characters was 100% effective in discriminating between 19 males and 18 females that had been sexed using molecular genetic methods. Re-classification using a jackknife procedure correctly identified 92% of individuals. The discriminant function should be a viable alternative to genetic sexing or laparoscopy for a large proportion of individuals within the Australo-Papuan range of this species; and can also be used to identify a small proportion of "ambiguous" individuals for which reliable sexing will require those other techniques. I used mitochondrial (mtDNA) control region sequence data to investigate the current distribution of genetic variation in this species at the continental level and within and between specified regional units. I was specifically interested in identifying breaks in genetic connectivity between the west and east of the continent and between Tasmania and the Australian mainland. Overall, genetic diversity was low and there was no significant level of genetic subdivision between regions. The observed genetic distribution suggests that the population expanded from a bottleneck approximately 160 000 years ago during the late Pleistocene, and spread throughout the continent through a contiguous range expansion. There is insufficient evidence to suggest division of the population into different units for conservation management purposes based on the theoretical definition of the 'evolutionary significant unit'. It is clear from the analysis that there are signatures of both historical and contemporary processes affecting the current distribution. Given the suggestion that population expansion has been relatively recent, additional sampling and confirmation of the perceived pattern of population structure using a nuclear marker is recommended to validate conservation monitoring and management at a continental scale.  To determine the existence of perceived population declines across ecological time scales, I analysed the Australian Bird Atlas Data to identify the extent and pattern of change in range and density of the species between three Atlas Periods (1901-1976, 1977-1981 and 1998-2001) using a new standardised frequency measure, the Occupancy Index (OI) for 1&#176; blocks (approx. 100km2) across the continent. At the continental scale, there was no significant difference in the spatial extent of occupancy between Atlas Periods. However, there were considerable changes in frequency and range extent between defined regions, and there were distinct differences in the pattern of change in OI between coastal and inland blocks over time. Coastal blocks showed much more change than inland blocks, with a clear increase in the use of coastal blocks, accompanied by a decrease in inland blocks, during the 1977-1981 Atlas Period, relative to both other Atlas Periods. The over-riding factor associated with distributional shifts and frequency changes was apparently climatic fluctuation (the 1977-1981 period showing the influence of El Nino associated drought). The impression of abundance was strongly dependent on both the temporal and spatial scale of analysis.  To test for correspondence between geographic variation in morphology and geographic variation in mtDNA I analysed morphometric data from 95 individuals from Australia and Papua New Guinea. First, the degree of morphometric variation between specified regions was determined. This was then compared with the pattern of genetic differentiation. There was a strong latitudinal cline in body dimensions. However, there was no relationship between morphometric variation and patterns of genetic variation at least for mtDNA. Females showed a pattern of isolation by distance based on morphometric characters whereas males did not. Three hypotheses to explain the pattern of morphometric variation were considered: phenotypic plasticity, natural selection and secondary contact between previously isolated populations. I conclude that the pattern of morphometric variation is best explained by the suggestion that there is sufficient local recruitment for natural selection to maintain the observed pattern of morphometric variation. This implies that gene flow may not be as widespread as the mtDNA analysis suggested. In this instance either the relatively recent colonisation history of the species or the inability of the mtDNA marker to detect high mutation rates among traits responsible for maintaining morphometric variation may be overestimating the levels of mixing among regions. As might be expected given the physical scale over which this study was conducted, the pattern of genetic, morphometric and physical distribution varied dependent on the scale of analysis. Regional patterns of genetic variation, trends in occupancy and density and morphometric variation did not reflect continental patterns, reinforcing the contention that extrapolation of data from local or regional levels is often inappropriate. The combined indirect methodologies applied in this study circumvent the restrictions imposed by direct ecological sampling, because they allow survey across large geographic and temporal scales effectively covering the entire Australian range of H. leucogaster. They also allow exploration of the evolutionary factors underpinning the species' current distribution.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Haliaeetus leucogaster</field><field name="subject">white-bellied sea-eagle</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">distribution</field><field name="subject">population</field><field name="subject">populations</field><field name="subject">population dynamics</field><field name="subject">bird</field><field name="subject">birds</field><field name="subject">raptor</field><field name="subject">raptors</field><field name="subject">eagle</field><field name="subject">eagles</field><field name="subject">population decline</field><field name="subject">declines</field><field name="subject">genetic variation</field><field name="subject">mitochondrial DNA</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041012.142221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">StarLink(TM) Corn: A Case Study</field><field name="creator">Sheumack, Michele Denise</field><field name="description">The 18 September 2000 disclosure that StarLink corn, a genetically engineered variety not approved for human consumption, had been detected in food was a seminal event in agricultural biotechnology. This thesis presents a comprehensive case study of the StarLink incident (part one), reviews the StarLink situation in terms of crisis management theory (part two) and develops crisis management theory using the StarLink incident as an example of a crisis (part three). Part one provides background information, then a meticulous day-by-day account of StarLink-related events.  Part two presents a detailed overview of crisis management theory, then examines the StarLink situation in terms of pre-crisis (warning signals, preconditions for a crisis, crisis trigger), crisis (how Aventis, the biotechnology provider, managed the crisis and opinions concerning crisis handling) and post-crisis (lessons learned).  Part three develops crisis management theory using the StarLink situation as an example of a crisis. It evaluates whether the StarLink incident possessed characteristics predicted for modern crises and suggests other factors which may become more prevalent and significant in future crises. The StarLink incident delivers certain practical lessons for managers, regulators and others and demonstrates a number of characteristics of modern crises.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic engineering</field><field name="subject">genetically engineered crops</field><field name="subject">genetically engineered food</field><field name="subject">agricultural biotechnology</field><field name="subject">StarLink</field><field name="subject">Aventis</field><field name="subject">problem management</field><field name="subject">crisis management</field><field name="subject">issues management</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040401.151800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conflict Escalation in Response to Continued Pushy, Dominating Behaviour in the Workplace: Ideal and Everyday Response Strategies Examined</field><field name="creator">Short, Leonie Marianne</field><field name="description">The aim of the current research program was to investigate the social context of escalation in response to continued pushy behaviour in the workplace.  In doing so, this research program contributes to the development of communication skills by investigating the entire context of skills required for effective communication in managing everyday conflict in the workplace.  The response class, Responding to continued pushy or dominating behaviour in the workplace, was selected as a vehicle for examining the context of escalation for two reasons.  Firstly, this response class, by the very nature of pushy behaviour, embodies a continued interaction.  In the past, assertive communication research has focused on one off responses rather than a continued interaction.  Secondly, this response class has been identified in previous research as being of interest to assertiveness trainees (Cooley, 1979, Lefevre &amp; West, 1984, Wilson &amp; Gallios, 1993).  The theoretical premise of the current research program resides in the application of Social Rules Theory to the difficult face-to-face communication situation, or response class, of responding to continued pushy behaviour in the workplace.  In doing so, this approach also takes into account dialectical theory, conflict resolution theory, and the concept of response components that can be selected and/or combined in order to meet the requirements, or rules, of a specific situation.  In adopting the Social Rules approach, the current research program addresses the key criticisms of the traditional approach to assertion and assertion training, namely that people behaving assertively are sometimes negatively evaluated for assertive behaviour (Wilson &amp; Gallois, 1993); and that assertion traditionally focused on the expressiveness of a response at the unintended cost of social or contextual appropriateness (Crawford, 1988); that finding a response is assertive does not delineate which aspects of the response are producing which types of effects (Galassi, 1978; Mullinix &amp; Galassi, 1981).  Most importantly, the current research contributes to the field by examining the negative response class in terms of a response sequence of escalation, rather than a one-off response.  This is new research and contributes to the field theoretically and to the conceptualisation of assertion and communication. In order to meet the goals of the current research program, the response class Responding to continued pushy behaviour in the workplace, was defined precisely in terms of the situational context.  This response class implies a workplace relationship of an ongoing nature.  Four other variables were involved in defining and investigating the situation.  These were status, gender of message sender, gender of message receiver, and response level (initial response, first escalation or second escalation).  The current program of research was carried out in a series of three related studies, and these four variables were examined in each of the three studies. The purpose of the first study was to elicit social rules and goals for interpersonally effective and appropriate escalation strategies in response to pushy dominating communication in the workplace.  This study was conducted in two parts, a qualitative questionnaire completed by 20 females and 20 males, and two focus groups, one for females and one for males.  Content analysis revealed a set of rules for an escalation sequence for each combination of status and gender.  These rules were then operationalized, filmed and analysed in the second study.  One hundred and twenty-three participants (64 females and 59 males) with work experience watched the operationalized responses and rated them on a series of seven scales.  These scales were effectiveness in stopping the pushy behaviour (task effectiveness), effectiveness in maintaining the relationship (maintenance effectives), social appropriateness, interpersonal skill required, risk involved, personal difficulty in making the response, and likelihood of making the response.  Analyses included descriptive statistics, which indicated that the operationalized responses were perceived to be effective and socially appropriate.  Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) were also conducted and revealed a number of significant interactions for each status level (manager, colleague, subordinate).  The third and final study in this research program adopted a qualitative approach to examine continued pushy or dominating communication in the workplace.  Eighty-two  (45 female and 37 male) participants completed a qualitative questionnaire utilizing an open-ended approach.  This questionnaire was designed for the purpose of the third study to elicit the typical behaviours, emotions and cognitions participants have in response to continued pushy behaviour in the workplace.  Also, a data analysis process was designed specifically for the third study to provide an analytical procedure that was as systematically rigorous and replicable as possible.  This process is explained in detail in Study 3.  The results of the third study revealed differences between actual behaviour and rule based behaviour in response to continued pushy behaviour, namely that actual responses are more public and direct in nature, and more likely to promote destructive conflict escalation.  This finding implies that typical responses are not as effective as rule based responses, highlighting the benefits of applying social rules to manage difficult face to face communication situations. In summary, the current research project utilized a multi-method approach in a series of three studies to reveal the nature of Social Rules based responses and typical responses.  The results of this research program have implications for both the theory and practice of effective communication and effective communication training.  Evaluation of both social rules based and typical responses have implications for communication trainees who wish to make informed choice based on a consideration of functionally effective behaviour and personal satisfaction.  For example, social rules for escalation in response to continued pushy behaviour from a male manager may indicate that it is most effective for a female subordinate to acquiesce.  However, the female subordinate may choose to violate social rules and risk being perceived as inappropriate and damaging the relationship, to achieve a super-ordinate goal or for personal satisfaction.  Conversely, the social rules and responses developed in the current research program have implications for professional effectiveness in the workplace by providing guidelines for dealing with dominating behaviour.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pushiness</field><field name="subject">pushy behaviour</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">dominating behaviour</field><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">commmunication skills</field><field name="subject">Social Rules Theory</field><field name="subject">response</field><field name="subject">responses</field><field name="subject">dialectical theory</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">workplace</field><field name="subject">workers</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040416.141210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying Opportunities for Education for Sustainability: Current Practices of Community-Based Environmental Groups</field><field name="creator">Skoien, Petra</field><field name="description">Education for sustainability (EFS) is emerging as a key strategy for learning and action towards sustainability. Community-based environmental groups are potentially important providers of, and contexts for, educating adults for sustainability because they engage the community in activities such as public awareness raising, advocacy and lobbying, community education, and participatory learning (UNESCO, 2004, p. 25). These groups have been identified as key stakeholders of EFS in UNESCO's strategic plan for the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, from 2005-2014 (UNESCO, 2004). Despite this recognition, there are few models or precedents to guide groups or programs in developing and implementing EFS in their strategies or activities. Additionally, education commonly associated with community-based environmental groups has been rather narrowly conceived as public awareness raising and individual behaviour change, and disconnected from advocacy (Clover, 2002a; Whelan, pending). This thesis addressed this gap in understanding by investigating the dimensions of education and learning in two community-based environmental groups in South-East QueensIand. The aim of this research was to develop a framework to explain and understand the role of education and learning within and by community-based environmental groups. The research inquiry was motivated by an interpretive interest in uncovering the educative dimensions arising from group members' engagement in the activities of community-based environmental groups. This aim was addressed through an investigation of: (1) the community education initiatives of community-based environmental groups; and (2) the learning that occurs within these groups through participation in social action, Two community-based environmental groups that participated in this study were Smogbusters, an environmental advocacy group, which focused on air quality and transport issues in Brisbane; and the Pumicestone Region Catchment Coordination Association, (PRCCA) a community-based natural resource management group. Information was gathered through participant observation, interviews with group members and project staff, and the collection of relevant documents from both groups. A conceptual framework based on five convergent themes in the contemporary EFS literature was used to interpret and analyse the activities of these groups, These are: (1) participation; (2) critical thinking; (3) local relevance; (4) holistic, interdisciplinary and systemic approaches; and (5) values-driven approaches. The analysis of both groups' community education initiatives revealed the use of approaches that extend beyond pubhc awareness, didactic, and information-based approaches to strategies that engaged the community more actively than was possible with conventional approaches. This reflects a more sophisticated and considered approach that connects education with advocacy as an integral part of groups' strategy and practice. The two case studies illustrate the use of participatory learning and action that incorporates adult learning approaches to enhance participation and learning. These findings contribute to knowledge that can help bridge the gap between education and advocacy in the activities of community-based environmental groups (Clover, 2002a; Whelan, 2005). The findings strongly suggest that the two groups engaged a form of education and action that approaches the potential of EFS as envisaged in policy documents and vision statements. The groups provided opportunities for action learning through advocacy and lobbying for policy change, and through a range of activities associated with addressing issues of natural resource management. In Smogbusters, participation in advocacy and education contributed to building the capacity of individuals to engage in social action for sustainable transport and air quality. In the PRCCA, group members' participation in natural resource management related activities developed their skills, knowledge and capacity to advocate for sustainable natural resource management practices. These findings confirm that local participation in environmental action and decision making builds on the individual and collective experiences of participants. Participation in action empowered and enabled group members to engage in action and change. In particular, participants developed a strong sense of their capacity to enact change, and to engage in social action. The findings of this research suggest that community-based environmental groups are important places for adults to gain a stronger sense of personal and collective agency towards sustainability. Further, participation in these groups is an important mechanism for environmental change to be brought about through collective action (Apel &amp; Camozzi, 1996). The research findings confirm that adult and popular education pedagogies can optimise learning in community-based environmental groups (Foley, 1999; Clover &amp; Hall, 2000; Clover; 2002a; Follen &amp; HaIl, 1998; Newman, 1995a). The framework may be able to assist project coordinators in developing and implementing community education strategies into their programs. Finally, the findings have implications for policy and program development in the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education for sustainability</field><field name="subject">environmental sustainability</field><field name="subject">Decade of Education for Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">community-based environmental groups (Brisbane)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070109.145756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination of Congestion in Road Traffic Emission Models and Their Application to Urban Road Networks</field><field name="creator">Smit, Robin</field><field name="description">The level of air pollution in urban areas, which is largely affected by road traffic, is an issue of high political relevance. Congestion is most prevalent in urban areas and a common and increasingly present phenomenon worldwide. The first four chapters of this study have investigated how and to what extent models, which are used to predict emissions on road links in urban road networks, include the effects of congestion on emissions. In order to make this assessment, traffic engineering literature and empirical studies have been examined and used as a basis to review (current) emission models that exist or have been used around the world. Congestion causes changes in driving patterns of individual vehicles in a traffic stream, and these changes are subsequently reflected in changes in congestion indicators and changes in emission levels. This consideration and a literature review has led to a proposed 'congestion typology' of emission models, which reflects the different ways in which and the extent to which congestion has been incorporated in these models. The typology clarifies that six of in total ten families of emission models that were investigated in this thesis explicitly consider congestion in the modelling process (i.e. model variables are related to congestion), although this is done in different ways. For the remaining four families of emission models it was not possible to determine the extent to which congestion has been incorporated on the basis of literature review alone. Two families fell beyond the scope of this work since they cannot be used to predict emission on road links. For the other two families it became clear in the course of the thesis that the extent can be determined through analysis of driving pattern data (and other information with respect to e.g. data collection) that were used in the model development. A new methodology is presented in this thesis to perform this analysis and to assess the mean level of congestion in driving patterns (driving cycles). The analysis has been carried out for one important family of emission models, the so-called travel speed models ('average speed models'), which are used extensively in urban network modelling. For four current models (COPERT III, MOBILE 6, QGEPA 2002, EMFAC 2000), it is concluded that these models implicitly (i.e. congestion is inherently considered) take varying levels of congestion into account, but that this conclusion is subject to a number of limitations. It became clear in the course of this study that prediction of (the effects of) congestion in both traffic models and emission models is generally restricted to certain modelling dimensions. As a consequence, the effects of congestion are only partially predicted in current air emission modelling. Chapter 5 has attempted to address the question whether congestion is actually an important issue in urban network emission modelling or not. It also addressed the question if different types of emission models actually predict different results. On the basis of a number of selection criteria, two types of models were compared, i.e. one explicit model (TEE-KCF 2002) and two implicit models (COPERT III, QGEPA 2002). The research objectives have been addressed by applying these emission models to a case-study urban network in Australia (Brisbane) for which various model input attributes were collected from different sources (both modelled and field data). The findings are limited by the fact that they follow from one urban network with particular characteristics (fleet composition, signal settings, speed limits) and application of only a few particular emission models. The results therefore indicate that: 1. Changes in traffic activity (i.e. distribution of vehicle kilometres travelled on network links) over the day appear to have the largest effect on predicted traffic emissions. 2. Congestion is an important issue in the modelling of CO and HC emissions. This appears not to be the case for NOx emissions, where basic traffic composition is generally a more important factor. For the most congested parts in the urban network that have been investigated, congestion can more than double predicted emissions of CO and HC. 3. Different types of emission models can produce substantially different results when absolute (arithmetic) differences are considered, but can produce similar results when relative differences (ratio or percent difference) are considered.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Air pollution</field><field name="subject">traffic congestion</field><field name="subject">emission models</field><field name="subject">urban network modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070724.155421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene Expression in Embryonic Chick Heart Development</field><field name="creator">Sneesby, Kyra</field><field name="description">Establishment of the biochemical and molecular nature of cardiac development is essential for us to understand the relationship between genetic and morphological aspects of heart formation. The molecular mechanisms that underly heart development are still not clearly defined. To address this issue we have used two approaches to identify genes involved in early chick cardiac development. Differential display previously conducted in our laboratory led to the identification of two gene fragments differentially expressed in the heart that are further described in this thesis. The full-length cDNA sequence of both eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2b (eIF-2b) and NADH cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R) were isolated using library screening. The upreglation of these genes during heart development is expected given the heart is the first functional organ to form in vertebrates and protein synthesis and cell metabolism at this stage of development is maximal. Limitations in the differential display approach led to the development and optimisation of a subtractive hybridisation approach for use with small amounts of cells or tissue. To focus on cardiac gene expression during the initial phases of heart development, subtractive hybridization was performed between the cardiogenic lateral plate mesoderm of Hamburger and Hamilton stage 4 embryos and the heart primordia of stage 9 embryos. Of the 87 independent clones identified by this procedure, 59 matched known sequences with high homology, 25 matched unknown expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences with high homology, and 3 did not match any known sequence on the database. Known genes isolated included those involved in transcription, translation, cell signalling, RNA processing, and energy production. Two of these genes, high mobility group phosphoprotein A2 (HMGA2) and C1-20C, an unknown gene, were chosen for further characterisation. The role of each gene in early chick heart development and indeed development in general, was addressed using techniques such as in situ hybridisation, transfection analysis, in ovo electroporation and RNAi.  HMGA2 is a nuclear phosphoprotein commonly referred to as an architectural transcription factor due to its ability to modulate DNA conformation. In keeping with this function, HMGA2/GFP fusion protein was shown to localise to the nucleus and in particular, the nucleolus. In situ hybridisation analysis suggested a role for HMGA2 in heart and somite development. HMGA2 expression was first detected at HH stage 5 in the lateral plate mesoderm, a region synonymous with cells specified to the cardiac fate. HMGA2 was also strongly expressed in the presomitic segmental plate mesoderm and as somites developed from the segmental plate mesoderm, the expression of HMGA2 showed an increasingly more restricted domain corresponding to the level of maturation of the somite. Restriction of HMGA2 expression was first detected in the dorsal region of the epithelial somite, then the dorsomedial lip of the dermomyotome, and finally the migrating epaxial myotome cells. The novel intronless gene, C1-20C, predicts a protein of 148 amino acids containing a putative zinc finger binding domain and prenyl binding motif. Zinc binding assays showed that the zinc finger domain of C1-20C/MBP fusion protein bound over six times the quantity of zinc compared to MBP alone, although not in a 1:1 stoichiometric molar ratio. C1-20C/GFP fusion protein was shown to localise to as yet unidentified intracellular cytoplasmic vesicular compartments. These compartments did not colocalise with the endosome/lysosome pathway, aparently ruling out a role for C1-20C in protein trafficking, recycling or degradation. Expression of C1-20C in the chick embryo suggests a possible role in heart and notochord development and preliminary results using siRNA suggest that C1-20C is involved in normal heart looping.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heart</field><field name="subject">heart development</field><field name="subject">heart formation</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">molecular genetics</field><field name="subject">chick heart</field><field name="subject">chick embryo</field><field name="subject">phosphoproteins</field><field name="subject">HMGA2</field><field name="subject">high mobility group phosphoprotein A2</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030924.153514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of Cultural Adjustment Among Young Former-Yugoslavian and Chinese Migrants To Australia</field><field name="creator">Sonderegger, Robi</field><field name="description">Australia is a culturally diverse country with many migrant and refugee families in need of mental health services. Yet, surveys indicate that many culturally diverse community members do not feel comfortable in accessing mental health services, often due to a limited understanding of current western practices and the lack of practitioner cultural sensitivity. Despite the apparent need, few investigations have been conducted with migrant families to understand their different values and needs, and identify how they adjust to a new culture. The paucity of empirical research is largely due to the number of variables associated with the process of cultural change, and the fact that culture itself may lend different meaning to symptom experience, and the expression thereof. Moreover, because migrant adaptation is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, it is often rendered difficult to investigate. Cultural groups have been observed to exhibit differences in the pathogenesis and expressions of psychological adjustment, thus making culturally sensitive assessment a particularly arduous yet important task. Although the number of studies conducted on cultural adaptation trends of adult migrants is growing, few investigations have examined the acculturation experiences of children and adolescents. Moreover, the link between acculturation and mental health has confounded researchers and practitioners alike. Considering assessment procedures largely influence therapeutic strategies, it is deemed essential that Australian health care professionals understand language, behavioural, and motivational differences between ethnic groups. In response to appeals for empirical data on culture-specific differences and developmental pathways of emotional resiliency and psychopathology, the present research program examines the complex interplay between situational factors and internal processes that contribute to mental health among young migrants and refugees. The research focuses particularly on anxiety, which is not only the most common form of childhood psychopathology but also frequently coincides with stressful life events such as cultural relocation. Two hundred and seventy-three primary and high school students (comprised of former-Yugoslavian and Chinese cultural groups) participated in this research program. Primary (n=131) and high school (n=142) students completed self-report measures of acculturation, internalising symptoms, social support, self-concept/esteem, ethnic identity, and future outlook, and were compared by cultural group, heterogenic ethnicity, school level, gender, and residential duration variables.  Specifically, Study 1 aimed to map the cultural adjustment patterns of migrant youth so as to determine both situational and internal process risk and protective factors of emotional distress. The main findings from Study 1 indicate: (1) patterns of cultural adjustment differ for children and adolescents according to cultural background, gender, age, and length of stay in the host culture; (2) former-Yugoslavian migrants generally report greater identification and involvement with Australian cultural norms than Chinese migrant youth; and (3) the divergent variables social support and bicultural adjustment are not universally paired with acculturative stress, as previously indicated in other adult migrant and acculturation studies. These outcomes highlight the importance of addressing the emotional and psychological needs of young migrants from unique age-relevant cultural perspectives.  Building on these outcomes, the aim of Study 2 was to propose an organisational structure for a number of single risk factors that have been linked to acculturative stress in young migrants. In recognising that divergent situational characteristics (e.g., school level, gender, residential duration in Australia, social support, and cultural predisposition) are selectively paired with internal processing characteristics (e.g., emotional stability, self-worth/acceptance, acculturation/identity, and future outlook), a top-down path model of acculturative stress for children and adolescents of Chinese and former-Yugoslavian backgrounds was proposed and tested. To determine goodness of model fit, path analysis was employed. Specific cross-cultural profiles, application for the proposed age and culture sensitive models, and research considerations are discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Former-Yugoslavian migrants</field><field name="subject">Chinese migrants</field><field name="subject">cultural adjustment</field><field name="subject">cultural adaptation</field><field name="subject">acculturation</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030918.153743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive Schemata and Project Manager Regulation of Unplanned Change: Categorical Analysis of Structured Interview Reports</field><field name="creator">Spencer, Carolyn R.</field><field name="description">A significant risk area for project sponsors is managing unplanned change. Theorists of organisational behaviour have attempted to understand the circumstances of how activity change occurs on projects and have identified the significant impact that time has on activity. This current research takes the study of cognition into the real world setting of project management at a level of analysis that is viable across diverse projects and industries to study project manager regulation of unplanned change. The project managers' cognitive representation of meaningful aspects of a project (their 'cognitive schemata'), which guides activity change during the project, was investigated and the effect of feedback evaluated in order to address the central research question of what triggers change on group projects. In the present research, leading edge projects from six major Australian industries (telecommunications, banking and insurance, information technology, railway signalling, inorganic chemistry and construction) were monitored at three key points through their lifecycle to understand how feedback impacts on project activity through the project manager&#146;s cognition leading to change. Six key categories of feedback were identified, which potentially represented the foci of project-related schemata, within a project management mental model. These were validated as important indicators for project management performance by a panel of Australia's leading experts in project management. Sixteen project managers participated in the field study, with their verbal reports being collected through structured interviews (incorporating a 'laddered' interview technique), which were developed and piloted across diverse projects for this purpose. Interview data were coded for analysis in terms of sensitivity to each of the six feedback foci and one control category, for five types of feedback and five types of change. Reliability of the content coding was checked through independent coding and found to be high. The research investigation was conducted within a schematic information processing conceptual framework developed for application within the domain of project management. Strong evidence was found that linked key schemata to the hypothesized effects of feedback. Overall, the effects were found to be general across all industries, individuals and projects. A contrasting effect was observed for one type of feedback where schemata were poorly developed in inexpert project managers, which raised the issue of measurable differences in behaviour arising from project management competency. The findings of strong relationships between the variables led to the proposed model of project manager cognition, which reveals an underlying structure in the schemata between key areas of sensitivity to feedback and unplanned change. The model is proposed as underpinning observed behaviour in this and prior research and suggests a relationship between competency and change regulation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organizations</field><field name="subject">organisations</field><field name="subject">organizational</field><field name="subject">organisational</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">planned</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="subject">unplanned</field><field name="subject">project</field><field name="subject">projects</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">manager</field><field name="subject">managers</field><field name="subject">cognitive</field><field name="subject">cognitive schemata</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">feedback</field><field name="subject">organisational psychology</field><field name="subject">organizational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040721.092038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Domestic Violence Against Pregnant Women: A Thai Perspective</field><field name="creator">Sricamsuk, Amornrat</field><field name="description">Little is known about domestic violence experienced by Thai pregnant women.  This exploratory descriptive study aimed to investigate the prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy and immediate postpartum period among Thai women aged between 18 and 45 years.  The study also aimed to investigate maternal and neonatal outcomes for childbearing women, the ways in which they dealt with domestic violence, barriers that inhibited them from seeking help or resisting violence, as well as the needs and support that would be helpful in dealing with domestic violence.  A cohort of 421 women in their third trimester of pregnancy was recruited from two tertiary public hospital antenatal clinics located in Khon Kaen Province, Northeastern Thailand.  Structured questionnaires were used.  Participants were again contacted at six weeks postpartum either in person at the family planning clinics or by telephone.  Two hundred and seventy-four women were able to be contacted.  The results showed that 53.7% of women reported psychological abuse, 26.6% experienced threats of and/or acts of physical abuse, and 19.2% experienced sexual violence during the current pregnancy.  In the postpartum period, 35.4% of women reported psychological abuse, 9.5% reported threats of and/or acts of physical abuse, and 11.3% experienced sexual abuse. Women who were abused during pregnancy showed significantly poorer health status compared to non-abused women in role emotional functioning, vitality, bodily pain, mental health and social functioning.  Women who experienced postpartum abuse reported significantly lower mean scores in mental health and social functioning than women who did not.  Antepartum haemorrhage was also found to be statistically associated with physical abuse.  No statistical differences were found between abuse status and neonatal outcomes.  There were several strategies used by abused women in dealing with domestic violence to maximize their safety including crying, keeping quiet, leaving violent situations and temporarily staying with relatives, seeking help from others, and notifying local authorities.  Support services that would be helpful for abused women in dealing with the problem included emotional support, social legal assistance, and community health promotion. Domestic violence during pregnancy and after birth is an increasing but under-recognized problem in Thailand.  It has pervasive consequences on maternal health.  The findings from this study suggest more interventions and urgent domestic violence support services need to be established in this remote area of Thailand.  This study also suggests routine screening for domestic violence should be established to provide effective early intervention and prevention of adverse consequences of violence, as pregnancy is a time when most pregnant women seek health care.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Domestic violence</field><field name="subject">abused pregnant women</field><field name="subject">postpartum abuse</field><field name="subject">Thai women</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070116.154749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Interplay Between Teachers' Beliefs and Practices in a Multi-Age Primary School</field><field name="creator">Standen, Richard Phillip</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research documented in this thesis is to investigate how one particular approach to groupings in one primary school, commonly referred to as multi-age, enables and constrains the practices and actions of its individual teachers. This study is located in a literature that examines the potential that beliefs and belief systems offer for understanding how teachers make sense of, and respond to particular educational contexts. It will be of particular interest to the community of scholars who are investigating the uptake of curriculum innovations in the classrooms of individual practitioners. The philosophical framework underpinning multi-age schooling is significantly different from that operating within the traditional lock-step system. The conventional school organisation has the child move through a predetermined curriculum at a fixed pace, whereas multi-age classes require that teachers focus on needs-based teaching, thus adapting the curriculum to suit the individual student. As a result of this shift in emphasis, it has been common for teachers in multi-age schools to experience dilemmas caused by the dissonance between their own and the school&#146;s assumptions about teaching, learning, knowledge and social relations. However, this clash of individuals&#146; beliefs and mandated practices is an under-researched area of scholarship particularly within multi-age settings, and is thus the focus of the present research. A framework based on the construct of beliefs and belief systems was used for understanding the personal and idiosyncratic nature of a teacher&#146;s practice. Such a framework proposes that beliefs can be classified in terms of personal assumptions about self, relationships, knowledge, change and teaching and learning. These classifications, rather than being discrete dimensions acting in isolation, tend to be organised into a coherent and interdependent belief system or orientation. The notion of orientation was found to be a suitable framework within which to investigate the interplay between beliefs and practices over a two year period in one school context that is likely to provide challenges and opportunities for professional growth and development. Because the study focused upon the beliefs and practices of six teachers in a multi-age setting, elements of a qualitative approach to research were employed. The research design adopted for this study is grounded in an interpretative approach which looks for culturally derived and historically situated interpretations of the social world. Within this framework a case-study approach to research was used so as to reveal the interplay between the teachers&#146; beliefs and practices. The study found that the concept of orientations provides a suitable framework for understanding the personal and idiosyncratic nature of a teacher&#146;s beliefs and practices. It was evident that beliefs about self, relationships, knowledge and change were highly significant in shaping the essential nature of teachers&#146; orientations. It was found that a summary label, based on these four beliefs, could be used to define the thematic nature of each teacher&#146;s orientation. These recognisably different labels demonstrated that each teacher&#146;s four beliefs were not just a pattern, but also a thematically defined pattern. It was also found that whilst some beliefs are thematically central other beliefs are not inherently thematic but are influenced in thematically derived ways. It was the configuration of these core/secondary beliefs that highlighted the importance of investigating belief combinations rather than discrete belief dimensions when attempting to understand the teacher as a person. It was also concluded that the teachers&#146; orientations in this study structured their practice in a way that was personal and internally consistent, indicating the dynamic coupling of beliefs and practices. It was clear that individual orientations, shaped by core beliefs, framed the challenges and possibilities that the multi-age ethos offered in varied and personal ways. In addition, the study found that the patterns of, and reasons for, change were complex and therefore it is unlikely that professional in-service will succeed if based on only one of the models of change proposed in the literature. The teachers in this study did not experience dilemmas as dichotomous situations but rather as complex and interrelated challenges to their whole belief system. Not all the teachers in this study approached the challenge of change in the same way. It was evident that individuals had constructed their own narrative for the need to change, and that this orientation tended to dominate the self-improvement agenda. Finally, this study demonstrated that not only the educational consequences of an innovation need to be taken into account, but also how well it is implemented in each classroom, and how compatible each teacher&#146;s orientation is with the ethos underpinning the innovation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">teacher attitudes</field><field name="subject">teacher beliefs</field><field name="subject">primary school</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">multi-age schooling</field><field name="subject">multiage schooling</field><field name="subject">nongraded schooling</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030730.102127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Access Methods for Temporal Databases</field><field name="creator">Stantic, Bela</field><field name="description">A Temporal database is one that supports some aspect of time distinct from user defined time. Over the last two decades interest in the field of temporal databases has increased significantly, with contributions from many researchers. However, the lack of efficient access methods is perhaps one of the reasons why commercial RDBMS vendors have been reluctant to adopt the advances in temporal database research. Therefore, an obvious research question is: can we develop more robust and more efficient access methods for temporal databases than the existing ones? This thesis attempts to address this question, and the main contributions of this study are summarised as follows: We investigated different representations of 'now' and how the modelling of current time influences the efficiency of accessing 'now relative' temporal data. A new method, called the 'Point' approach, is proposed. Our approach not only elegantly models the current time but also significantly outperforms the existing methods. We proposed a new index structure, called a Virtual Binary tree (VB-tree), based on spatial representation of interval data and a regular triangular decomposition of this space. Further, we described a sound and complete query algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is then evaluated both asymptotically and experimentally with respect to the state-of-the-art in the field. We claim that the VB-tree requires less space and uses fewer disk accesses than the currently best known structure - the RI-tree.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Temporal database</field><field name="subject">point approach</field><field name="subject">virtual binary tree</field><field name="subject">index structure</field><field name="subject">query algorithm</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060906.144815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Power of Categorical Goodness-Of-Fit Statistics</field><field name="creator">Steele, Michael C.</field><field name="description">The relative power of goodness-of-fit test statistics has long been debated in the literature. Chi-Square type test statistics to determine 'fit' for categorical data are still dominant in the goodness-of-fit arena. Empirical Distribution Function type goodness-of-fit test statistics are known to be relatively more powerful than Chi-Square type test statistics for restricted types of null and alternative distributions. In many practical applications researchers who use a standard Chi-Square type goodness-of-fit test statistic ignore the rank of ordinal classes. This thesis reviews literature in the goodness-of-fit field, with major emphasis on categorical goodness-of-fit tests. The continued use of an asymptotic distribution to approximate the exact distribution of categorical goodness-of-fit test statistics is discouraged. It is unlikely that an asymptotic distribution will produce a more accurate estimation of the exact distribution of a goodness-of-fit test statistic than a Monte Carlo approximation with a large number of simulations. Due to their relatively higher powers for restricted types of null and alternative distributions, several authors recommend the use of Empirical Distribution Function test statistics over nominal goodness-of-fit test statistics such as Pearson's Chi-Square. In-depth power studies confirm the views of other authors that categorical Empirical Distribution Function type test statistics do not have higher power for some common null and alternative distributions. Because of this, it is not sensible to make a conclusive recommendation to always use an Empirical Distribution Function type test statistic instead of a nominal goodness-of-fit test statistic. Traditionally the recommendation to determine 'fit' for multivariate categorical data is to treat categories as nominal, an approach which precludes any gain in power which may accrue from a ranking, should one or more variables be ordinal. The presence of multiple criteria through multivariate data may result in partially ordered categories, some of which have equal ranking. This thesis proposes a modification to the currently available Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistics for ordinal and nominal categorical data to account for situations of partially ordered categories. The new test statistic, called the Combined Kolmogorov-Smirnov, is relatively more powerful than Pearson's Chi-Square and the nominal Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic for some null and alternative distributions. A recommendation is made to use the new test statistic with higher power in situations where some benefit can be achieved by incorporating an Empirical Distribution Function approach, but the data lack a complete natural ordering of categories. The new and established categorical goodness-of-fit test statistics are demonstrated in the analysis of categorical data with brief applications as diverse as familiarity of defence programs, the number of recruits produced by the Merlin bird, a demographic problem, and DNA profiling of genotypes. The results from these applications confirm the recommendations associated with specific goodness-of-fit test statistics throughout this thesis.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">goodness-of-fit tests</field><field name="subject">chi-square test</field><field name="subject">empirical distribution function test</field><field name="subject">Kolmogorov-Smirnov test</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031006.143823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of Men's Decision Making and Decisional Conflict after Localised Prostate Cancer</field><field name="creator">Steginga, Suzanne Kathleen</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to describe how men with localised prostate cancer make decisions about their medical treatments, to describe the psychological and decision-related adjustment of these men over time, and to identify what variables predict decision-related adjustment.  Chapter 1 reviews the medical context of localised prostate cancer and factors that influence men's decision making in this context.  It is concluded that owing to ongoing uncertainty about the optimal medical treatment for this cancer and the substantial negative quality of life effects of treatments, how men make decisions in this context is an important research question.  Further, although men with prostate cancer are high seekers of medical treatment information, knowledge about how men use such information and actually make this treatment decision is limited.  Chapter 2 discusses research approaches currently applied to patient decision making: first, a social interaction approach encompassing the interaction between the patient and their physician and the social context influencing this interaction (Charles, Gafni, &amp; Whelan, 1999); and second, normative decision theory (Shafir &amp; Tversky, 1992; von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern, 1947).  The Heuristic-Systematic Processing model (Chaiken, 1980) is then proposed as a theoretical framework for investigating patient decision making that includes both systematic and non-systematic decision strategies. Chapter 3 reviews applied decision research in cancer, and presents an overview of research findings regarding patients' preferences for involvement in decision making, the relationship between decisional involvement and psychological adjustment, and decisional support interventions.  Research on adjustment to cancer is discussed and the need for further  research about men's psychological and decision-related adjustment after localised prostate cancer is identified.  Finally, a multivariate analysis of decision-related adjustment for men with localised prostate cancer based on the stress and coping framework of Lazarus and Folkman (1984) is proposed. Chapter 4 describes Study 1 that was an experiment to investigate the utility of the Heuristic-Systematic Processing model (HSM) in explaining low desire for involvement in decision making about prostate cancer treatments as an example of use of the expert opinion heuristic.  Using a hypothetical decision scenario about localised prostate cancer it was found that a low desire for involvement in decision making by men was predicted by a high belief in powerful others controlling health, a low belief in the self being responsible for good health, a high preference for black and white thinking, and a lower level of education.  This study provides preliminary support for use of the HSM in this context and for the conceptualisation of decision deferral as the expert opinion heuristic.  Chapter 5 introduces and describes the method of Study 2 that was a descriptive, prospective study of men's decision making after an actual diagnosis of localised prostate cancer.  This method allowed for an analysis of men's decision making that includes both systematic and non-systematic processes, and for further investigation of the utility of the HSM in explaining decision behaviour.  In addition, a multivariate approach was used to describe men's physical, psychological and decision-related adjustment over time, and to identify psychological predictors of decision-related adjustment. Chapters 6 describes men's use of systematic processing as limited and the use of non-systematic processes, such as lay beliefs and heuristics, as pervasive.  It is concluded that patients do not utilise information about medical treatments in a comprehensive or systematic way when making treatment decisions and that patients' decision making is biased by their prior beliefs about cancer and health.  A framework is outlined to demonstrate how the results of Study 1 and 2 support the application of the HSM to decision making about prostate cancer with particular reference to the role of beliefs about the physician, health locus of control, and uncertainty about the treatment decision in influencing decision strategies. Chapter 7 describes men's physical, psychological and decision-related adjustment over time, and concludes that decision-related distress is high but psychological distress in general is low.  Decisional conflict at diagnosis and at twelve months concurrently, and at two months prospectively, was predicted by dispositional optimism; and this effect was mediated by the man's proximal cognitive appraisal of the impact of the cancer.  It is concluded that decisional conflict is a person's cognitive judgment of the treatment decision that is generated by similar processes to that of the psychological distress that follows a cancer diagnosis.

With the prevalence of the disease increasing in the non-Aboriginal population in Australia, many children may be at risk of long-term learning and behavioural problems. There are conflicting findings in the research literature regarding the effects of this type of hearing loss. Although it is expected that the insertion of tympanostomy tubes (grommets) will reduce the duration and prevalence of both the disease and the conductive hearing loss, this does not always happen. For some primary school aged children it appears that experience with otitis media with effusion with or without grommet insertion is associated with various education problems including poor academic achievement and inappropriate behaviour. A current concern is whether or not these possible effects would continue to influence the learning and behaviour of children as they continue into their high school years. A review of the literature suggests that multiple factors including interrelationships between experience of otitis media with effusion, family and childcare environments may be involved in explaining why some students do not achieve as expected at school (Roberts et al., 2000). The literature further suggests there may be a cumulative effect in these factors, which introduces both quantitative and qualitative aspects to the discussion. A study was undertaken to identify the impact of otitis media with effusion and its associated sequelae on the learning and behaviour of high school students. Information from parents of high school students in Years 8 and 9 was used to identify students for inclusion in the study and to provide information on their medical and educational history as well as the parents' perceptions of various aspects of the students' learning and behaviour (including social skills). Three groups were formed: a Non-OME/Non-Grommet Group (n = 28), an OME/Grommet Group (n = 17) and an OME/Non-Grommet Group (n = 32). The TORCH, WRAT 3 and the Test of Syntactic Abilities (Screening Test) were administered to the students who also provided their own perceptions of specific aspects of their own learning and behaviour on a survey form. Teachers' perceptions on these areas were also collected. School academic records as well as data from school behavioural records were used.  Analysis of the results revealed a range of mild effects. These included poorer academic results particularly for girls with a history of grommets, who also exhibited a lack of confidence in their social skills. An increase in behaviour problems for boys with a history of the disease (with or without grommets) was also found. The study identifies a number of associated teaching and learning issues including noise levels in childcare environments and school classrooms, current teaching and learning methodology and the training of new teachers. It recommends a number of areas for future research including more in-depth questioning of parents regarding their awareness of hearing problems in their children, the use of more fine-grained measures to assess learning outcomes and the identification of possible gender differences associated with the disease and experiences with grommets.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">otitis media</field><field name="subject">effusion</field><field name="subject">hearing loss</field><field name="subject">conductive hearing loss</field><field name="subject">hearing impairment</field><field name="subject">hearing impaired</field><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="subject">adolescent</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">academic achievement</field><field name="subject">grommet</field><field name="subject">grommets</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040319.142844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic and Functional Characterization of RUNX2</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Alexandre</field><field name="description">RUNX2 belongs to the RUNT domain family of transcription factors of which three have been identified in humans (RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3). RUNX proteins are vital for metazoan development and participate in the regulation of cellular differentiation and cell cycle progression (Coffman, 2003). RUNX2 is required for proper bone formation by driving the differentiation of osteoblasts from mesenchymal progenitors during development (Ducy et al, 1997; Komori et al, 1997; Otto et al, 1997). RUNX2 is also vital for chondrocyte maturation by promoting the differentiation of chondrocytes to the hypertrophic phenotype (Enomoto et al, 2000). The consequences of completely disrupting the RUNX2 locus in mice provided compelling and conclusive evidence for the biological importance of RUNX2 where knockout mice died shortly after birth with a complete lack of bone formation (Komori et al, 1997; Otto et al, 1997). A further indication of the requisite role of RUNX2 in skeletal development was the discovery that RUNX2 haploinsufficiency in humans and mice caused the skeletal syndrome Cleidocranial Dysplasia (CCD) (Mundlos et al, 1997; Lee et al, 1997). A unique feature of RUNX2 is the consecutive polyglutamine and polyalanine tracts (Q/A domain). Mutations causing CCD have been observed in the Q/A domain of RUNX2 (Mundlos et al, 1997). The Q/A domain is an essential part of RUNX2 and participates in transactivation function (Thirunavukkarasu et al, 1998). Previous genotyping studies conducted in our laboratory identified several rare RUNX2 Q/A variants in addition to a frequently occurring 18 base pair deletion of the polyalanine tract termed the 11Ala allele. Analysis of serum parameters in 78 Osteoarthritis patients revealed the 11Ala allele was associated with significantly decreased osteocalcin. Furthermore, analysis of 11Ala allele frequencies within a Geelong Osteoporosis Study (GOS) fracture cohort and an appropriate age matched control group revealed the 11Ala allele was significantly overrepresented in fracture cases indicating an association with increased fracture risk.  To further investigate the 11Ala allele and rare Q/A variants, 747 DNA samples from the Southeast Queensland bone study were genotyped using PCR and PAGE. The experiment served two purposes: 1) to detect additional rare Q/A variants to enrich the population of already identified mutants and 2) have an independent assessment of the effect of the 11Ala allele on fracture to either support or refute our previous observation which indicated the 11Ala allele was associated with an increased risk of fracture in the GOS. From the 747 samples genotyped, 665 were WT, 76 were heterozygous for the 11Ala allele, 5 were homozygous for the 11Ala allele and 1 was heterozygous for a rare 21 bp deletion of the polyglutamine tract.  Chi-square analysis of RUNX2 genotype distributions within fracture and non-fracture groups in the Southeast Queensland bone study revealed that individuals that carried at least one copy of the 11Ala allele were enriched in the fracture group (p = 0.16, OR = 1.712). The OR of 1.712 was of similar magnitude to the OR observed in the GOS case-control investigation (OR = 1.9) providing support for the original study. Monte-Carlo simulations were used to combine the results from the GOS and the Southeast Queensland bone study. The simulations were conducted with 10000 iterations and demonstrated that the maximum probability of obtaining both study results by chance was less than 5 times in two hundred (p &lt; 0.025) suggesting that the 11Ala allele of RUNX2 was associated with an increased fracture risk.  The second element of the research involved the analysis of rare RUNX2 Q/A variants identified from multiple epidemiological studies of bone. Q/A repeat variants were derived from four populations: the GOS, an Aberdeen cohort, CAIFOS and a Sydney twin study. Collectively, a total of 20 rare glutamine and one alanine variants were identified from 4361 subjects. All RUNX2 Q/A variants were heterozygous for a mutant allele and a wild type allele. Analysis of incident fracture during a five year follow up period in the CAIFOS revealed that Q-variants (n = 8) were significantly more likely to have fractured compared to non-carriers (p = 0.026, OR 4.932 95% CI 1.2 to 20.1). Bone density data as measured by quantitative ultrasound was available for CAIFOS. Analysis of BUA and SOS Z-scores revealed that Q-repeat variants had significantly lower BUA (p = 0.031, mean Z-score of -0.79) and a trend for lower SOS (p = 0.190, mean Z-score of -0.69). BMD data was available for all four populations. To normalize the data across the four studies, FN BMD data was converted into Z-scores and the effect of the Q/A variants on BMD was analysed using a one sample approach. The analysis revealed Q/A variants had significantly lower FN BMD (p = 0.0003) presenting with a 0.65 SD decrease.  Quantitative transactivation analysis was conducted on RUNX2 proteins harbouring rare glutamine mutations and the 11Ala allele. RUNX2 proteins containing a glutamine deletion (16Q), a glutamine insertion (30Q) and the 11Ala allele were overexpressed in NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells and their ability to transactivate a known target promoter was assessed. The 16Q and 30Q had significantly decreased reporter activity compared to WT in NIH3T3 cells (p = 0.002 and 0.016, for 16Q and 30Q, respectively). In contrast 11Ala RUNX2 did not show significantly different promoter activation potential (p = 0.54). Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells where both the 16Q and 30Q RUNX2 displayed decreased reporter activity (p=0.007 and 0.066 for 16Q and 30Q respectively) whereas the 11Ala allele had no material effect on RUNX2 function (p = 0.20). The RUNX2 gene target reporter assay provided evidence to suggest that variation within the glutamine tract of RUNX2 was capable of altering the ability of RUNX2 to activate a known target promoter. In contrast, the 11Ala allele showed no variation in RUNX2 activity.  The third feature of the research served the purpose of identifying potential RUNX2 gene targets with particular emphasis on discovering genes cooperatively regulated by RUNX2 and the powerful bone promoting agent BMP2. The experiment was conducted by creating stably transfected NIH3T3 cells lines overexpressing RUNX2 or BMP2 or both RUNX2 and BMP2. Microarray analysis revealed very few genes were differentially regulated between standard NIH3T3 cells and cells overexpressing RUNX2. The results were confirmed via RT-PCR analysis which demonstrated that the known RUNX2 gene targets Osteocalcin and Matrix Metalloproteinase-13 were modestly induced  2.5 fold (p = 0.00017) and 2.1 fold (p = 0.002) respectively in addition to identifying only two genes (IGF-II and SCYA11) that were differentially regulated greater than 10 fold. IGF-II and SYCA11 were significantly down-regulated 27.6 fold (p = 1.95 x 10-6) and 10.1 fold (p = 0.0002) respectively. The results provided support for the notion that RUNX2 on its own was not sufficient for optimal gene expression and required the presence of additional factors.  To discover genes cooperatively regulated by RUNX2 and BMP2, microarray gene expression analysis was performed on standard NIH3T3 cells and NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with both RUNX2 and BMP2. Comparison of the gene expression profiles revealed the presence of a large number of differentially regulated genes. Four genes EHOX, CCL9, CSF2 and OSF-1 were chosen to be further characterized via RT-PCR. Sequential RT-PCR analysis on cDNA derived from control cells and cells stably transfected with either RUNX2, BMP2 or both RUNX2/BMP2 revealed that EHOX and CSF2 were cooperatively induced by RUNX2 and BMP2 whereas CCL9 and OSF-1 were suppressed by BMP2. The overexpression of both RUNX2 and BMP2 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts provided a powerful model upon which to discover potential RUNX2 gene targets and also identify genes synergistically regulated by BMP2 and RUNX2.  The fourth element of the research investigated the role of RUNX2 in the ascorbic acid mediated induction of MMP-13 mRNA. The study was carried out using NIH3T3 cell lines stably transfected with BMP2, RUNX2 and both BMP2 and RUNX2. The cell lines were grown to confluence and subsequently cultured for a further 12 days in standard media or in media supplemented with AA. RT-PCR analysis was used to assess MMP-13 mRNA expression. The RT-PCR results demonstrated that AA was not sufficient for inducing MMP-13 mRNA in NIH3T3 cells. In contrast RUNX2 significantly induced MMP-13 levels 85 fold in the absence of AA (p = 0.0055) and upregulated MMP-13 mRNA levels 254 fold in the presence of AA (p = 0.0017). The results demonstrated that RUNX2 was essential for the AA mediated induction of MMP-13 mRNA in NIH3T3 cells. The effect of BMP2 on MMP-13 expression was also investigated. BMP2 induced MMP-13 mRNA transcripts a modest 3.8 fold in the presence of AA (p = 0.0027). When both RUNX2 and BMP2 were overexpressed in the presence of AA, MMP-13 mRNA levels were induced a massive 4026 fold (p = 8.7 x 10-4) compared to control cells. The investigation revealed that RUNX2 was an essential factor for the AA mediated induction of MMP-13 and that RUNX2 and BMP2 functionally cooperated to regulate MMP-13 mRNA levels.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic Characterization</field><field name="subject">Functional Characterization</field><field name="subject">RUNX</field><field name="subject">RUNX2</field><field name="subject">RUNT domain family</field><field name="subject">transcription factors</field><field name="subject">metazoan development</field><field name="subject">cellular differentiation</field><field name="subject">cell cycle progression</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070823.100953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping Benthic Habitats for Representation in Marine Protected Areas</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Tim</field><field name="description">Virtually all marine conservation planning and management models in place or proposed have in common the need for improved scientific rigour in identifying and characterising the marine habitats encompassed. An emerging central theme in the last few years has been the concept of representativeness, or representative systems of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The habitat classification and mapping needed to incorporate considerations of representativeness into MPA planning must logically be carried out at the same scale at which management occurs. Management of highly protected areas occurs almost exclusively at local scales or finer, independent of the reservation model or philosophy employed.  Moreton Bay, on Australia&#146;s east coast, was selected for studies at the local scale to map and classify macrobenthic habitats. In a site scale (1 km) trial for the major habitat classification study, remote underwater videography was used to map and characterise an unusual assemblage of epibenthic invertebrates on soft sediments. The assemblage included congregations of the comatulid crinoid Zygometra cf. Z. microdiscus (Bell) at densities up to 0.88 individuals.m-2, comparable to those found in coral reef habitats. There was no correlation between the distribution of this species and commonly used abiotic surrogates depth (6 &#150; 18 m), sediment composition and residual current. This site scale trial is the first quantitative assessment of crinoid density and distribution in shallow water soft-sediment environments. The high densities found are significant in terms of the generally accepted picture of shallow-water crinoids as essentially reefal fauna. The findings highlight the conservation benefits of an inclusive approach to marine habitat survey and mapping. Assemblages such as the one described, although they may be of scientific and ecological significance, would have been overlooked by common approaches to marine conservation planning which emphasise highly productive or aesthetically appealing habitats. Most habitat mapping studies rely solely or in part on abiotic surrogates for patterns of  biodiversity. The utility of abiotic variables in predicting biological distributions at the local scale (10 km) was tested. Habitat classifications of the same set of 41 sites based on 6 abiotic variables and abundances of 89 taxa and bioturbation indicators were compared using correlation, regression and ordination analyses. The concepts of false homogeneity and false heterogeneity were defined to describe types of errors associated with using abiotic surrogates to construct habitat maps. The best prediction by abiotic surrogates explained less than 30% of the pattern of biological similarity. Errors of false homogeneity were between 20 and 62%, depending on the methods of estimation. Predictive capability of abiotic surrogates at the taxon level was poor, with only 6% of taxon / surrogate correlations significant. These results have implications for the widespread use of abiotic surrogates in marine habitat mapping to plan for, or assess,  representation in Marine Protected Areas. Abiotic factors did not discriminate sufficiently between different soft bottom communities to be a reliable basis for mapping.  Habitat mapping for the design of Marine Protected Areas is critically affected by the scale of the source information. The relationship between biological similarity of macrobenthos and the distance between sites was investigated at both site and local scales, and for separate biotic groups. There was a significant negative correlation between similarity and distance, in that sites further apart were less similar than sites close together. The relationship, although significant, was quite weak at the site scale. Rank correlograms showed that similarity was high at scales of 10 km or less, and declined markedly with increasing distance. There was evidence of patchiness in the distributions of some biotic groups, especially seagrass and anthozoans, at scales less than 16 km.  In other biotic groups there was an essentially monotonic decline in similarity with distance. The spatial agglomeration approach to habitat mapping was valid in the study area. Site spacing of less than 10 km was necessary to capture important components of biological similarity. Site spacing of less than 2.5 km did not appear to be warranted.  Macrobenthic habitat types were classified and mapped at 78 sites spaced 5 km apart. The area mapped was about 2,400 km2 and extended from estuarine shallow subtidal waters to offshore areas to the 50 m isobath. Nine habitat types were recognised, with only one on hard substrate. The habitat mapping characterised several habitat types not previously described in the area and located deepwater algal and soft coral reefs not previously reported. Seagrass beds were encountered in several locations where their occurrence was either unknown or had not previously been quantified. The representation of the derived habitat types within an existing marine protected area was assessed. Only two habitat types were represented in highly protected zones, with less than 3% of each included The study represents the most spatially comprehensive survey of epibenthos undertaken in Moreton Bay, with over 40,000 m2 surveyed. Derived habitat maps provide a robust basis for inclusion of representative examples of all habitat types in marine protected area planning in and adjacent to Moreton Bay. The utility of video data to conduct a low-cost habitat survey over a comparatively large area was also demonstrated.  The method used has potentially wide application for the survey and design of marine protected areas.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine habitats</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">Marine Protected Areas</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">benthos</field><field name="subject">benthic habitat</field><field name="subject">habitat classification</field><field name="subject">habitat mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040303.124815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lifecycle Management of Information Technology (IT) Projects in Construction</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Rodney Anthony</field><field name="description">The last twenty years has seen a tremendous change in the way companies do business. Much of this change can be attributed to the so-called information revolution. The integrated interaction between Information Technology (IT) and business processes has changed from its initial function of automating clerical tasks (e.g. payroll, inventory) to providing pertinent information for operational, managerial and executive groups within the organisation. In more recent times, IT has enabled some organisations, including those in the construction industry, to transform or re-engineer their business processes in the face of the rapidly changing business environment. As international competition continues to intensify, significant numbers of construction organisations are investing large amounts of resources into IT as they seek to gain competitive advantage. IT is increasingly being implemented for strategic reasons, so as to enable improved efficiency, better control and enhanced productivity of internal processes. The failure of realising expected IT-induced benefits has led to a growing number of senior executives to question the value of IT investments. Thus, questions like the following are typical: Are we getting our money's worth from our IT investment? ; Are we spending too much or too little on IT? ; What IT projects make the best use of our resources? ; How can we improve the return on our IT investments? This Ph.D. research study was inspired by the perceived lack of a structured framework for the selection, implementation and performance evaluation of IT projects in construction. The development of such a generic framework that could capture the IT project lifecycle management process, and the associated guidelines and procedures for its effective implementation, is a young field of research, still struggling to define its place within the large family of academic disciplines. Being a young branch of science, it might be argued that IT in construction lacks a solid methodological foundation. An IT project lifecycle management process is an integrated approach that provides for the continuous identification, selection, implementation, monitoring and performance evaluation of IT projects. This structured process should provide a systematic method for construction organisations to minimise risks while maximising returns on IT investments. To effectively employ IT in construction, the IT project lifecycle management process should have elements of three essential phases: (1) IT project(s) selection; (2) strategic IT implementation and monitoring; and (3) IT performance evaluation. However, each phase should not be viewed as a separate step. Rather, each is conducted as part of a continuous, interdependent management effort. Information gained from one phase is used to support activities in each of the other two phases. With this in mind, this research study aimed to develop an appropriate framework and associated tools for each phase of the IT project lifecycle. The developed three frameworks are detailed individually in the following paragraphs. The developed IT project(s) selection framework utilised information economics theory to encompass the full spectrum of direct and indirect costs, tangible and intangible expected benefits and the intangible risks associated with IT project proposals, considered for funding by the organisation. To incorporate the uncertainty that normally surrounds quantifying costs, benefits and risks, the framework employed a simple but powerful fuzzy logic technique to integrate all the monetary and non-monetary factors into a form that enabled the ranking of proposals. A case study was undertaken with a large international project management and development organisation to demonstrate the framework's applicability. The case study illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach for ranking IT project proposals. Once a portfolio of IT projects is selected for funding by the organisation, it needs to be strategically implemented and monitored over its lifecycle. A strategic IT implementation and monitoring framework was developed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of this phase. The framework is premised on a hybrid analysis utilising the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and SWOT analysis. A case study was undertaken to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in the strategic implementation and monitoring of a Project Management Information System (PMIS) by a large Australian construction-contracting organisation. The framework application proved to be successful in helping the organisation to develop appropriate strategies for the effective and efficient implementation of the PMIS. An IT performance evaluation framework and method was then developed for the final phase of the lifecycle. This framework was the primary focus of this Ph.D. research study and was structured using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) principles adapted to the specific requirements of the construction industry. The framework was structured using a hierarchy of IT performance perspectives, indicators and measures. Five definable perspectives were conceptually developed through analysis and synthesis of the 'IT business value' evaluation literature. These are: operational, benefits, technology/system, strategic competitiveness and user orientation. Indicators and measures were extracted from the mainstream IT literature and construction management literature, as well as the emerging literature on information economics. The preliminary list of indicators was initially screened through consultation with construction professionals and conceptual cause-and-effect mapping. The screened list of project-tier indicators was further refined through questionnaire dissemination. The questionnaire was sent to 322 construction project participants from large construction-contracting and project management organisations located within Australia. The five framework perspectives were statistically validated through the principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation. Each perspective and indicator's relative weight was numerically established using the questionnaire survey results as input to the recently developed Performance Measurement Process Framework (PMPF). The reason that the performance measures were not justified through a quantitative analysis was due to their dynamic nature. Most performance measures change, and will continue to change, with new technology. The developed perspectives, indicators and measures were all compiled into a generic 'Construct IT' BSC that can serve as a template for application at other decision-making tiers of a construction organisation. The problem of combining performance measures, with varying metrics, into commensurable units (utiles) was achieved by applying utility theory. Finally, the developed 'Construct IT' BSC was utilised for a project-tier survey to test the interrelationship between framework indicators and perspectives. Using information collected from 82 project professionals, from large construction-contracting and project management organisations, correlation and independent sample t-tests (one-tailed) provided support for the 'Construct IT' BSC. Specifically, findings suggest that the 'Construct IT' BSC can be used as a tool for monitoring the IT-induced value creation process. In addition, it appears that the proposed 'Construct IT' BSC framework and associated performance evaluation method is both flexible in design and can be modified to suit the needs of individual organisations. These characteristics make the framework continuously relevant to the dynamic nature of IT projects. In summary, the proposed IT project lifecycle management process, and its associated frameworks, provides a holistic view of IT implementation in construction and offers significant contributions to current body of knowledge on IT in construction.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">construction industry</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">IT</field><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">project lifecycle management</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030423.122317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Roles of RasGAP SH3 Domain Binding Proteins (G3BPs) in RNA Metabolism, the Cellular Stress Response and Tumorigenesis</field><field name="creator">Stirling, Susan Renee</field><field name="description">G3BP1 and G3BP2 are members of a highly conserved family of multi-functional RNA binding proteins, which appear to co-ordinate signal transduction and post-transcriptional gene regulation. Both proteins are over-expressed in cancer, and G3BP1 promotes cell proliferation and survival. Aberrant expression of various RNA binding proteins is common in cancer, and several of these proteins influence tumorigenesis. Therefore, detailed examination of RNA binding proteins, such as G3BPs, may provide insights into the post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. Tumours arise as a consequence of genetic mutation or alteration, which often result from stress-induced DNA damage. Cancer progression is facilitated by various epigenetic stress adaptation mechanisms. Stressful stimuli induce transitory translational shut-off, mediated by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor alpha;(eIF2alpha;). This phosphorylation event leads to formation of discrete cytoplasmic foci known as stress granules (SGs), which are translationally-silent sites of mRNA sorting. It was initially thought that an RNA-binding protein, T-cell internal antigen 1 (TIA-1), was instrumental in both the formation and functioning of SGs, because over-expression of TIA-1 induces spontaneous SGs and concomitantly causes a decrease in reporter gene expression. It is now clear that SG content can change depending on the type of stress, and that various proteins, including G3BP1, can induce spontaneous SGs. In vitro evidence previously implicated both G3BP1 and G3BP2 as endoribonucleases, so it was suggested that G3BPs act to target mRNA for decay at the SG. This project sought to further investigate this proposal, and in this way gain insight into the specific function of G3BPs in post-transcriptional regulation during tumorigenesis. Characterisation of G3BP1 and G3BP2 expression and localisation patterns in human cells and cancer was necessary before functional analyses in human cell systems could be undertaken. Both proteins were found to be over-expressed in breast cancer, irrespective of cancer stage or grade. G3BP1 and G3BP2 were also expressed in all human cell lines tested, despite previously observed tissue-specific expression. These results support the notion that G3BP expression is switched on in parallel with cell proliferation, and as such, may influence tumorigenesis. The results of further analyses suggested that the diverse functions attributed to G3BP1 and G3BP2 may be facilitated by isoform-specific expression, various post-translational modifications and sub-cellular localisation. Despite the absence of a canonical endoribonuclease domain, it was previously reported that site-specific phosphorylation of G3BP1 enables the protein to degrade a synthetic c-myc RNA substrate in vitro. This finding implicated G3BP in the specific regulation of a proto-oncogene. Tailored reporter assays were thus designed in order to address the in vivo consequences of G3BP's putative endoribonuclease activity. Contrary to expectations, all G3BP family members increased or maintained the expression of a range of reporters, at both the mRNA and protein level, irrespective of the presence of any particular cis-acting element, coding sequence or promoter. These results support the emerging notion that G3BPs positively affect the expression of at least some of their target mRNAs, and may also indirectly promote transcription. In contrast to the theory that G3BPs degrade proto-oncogenic mRNA/s, these findings are consistent with a role for G3BP in promoting cell proliferation and survival. Further analyses showed that G3BP1 and G3BP2 simultaneously increased reporter gene expression and induced SG formation. These findings highlighted the fact that SGs are dynamic sorting stations for mRNAs, and not merely sites of stalled translation. This result also supports the notion that a variety of proteins may be recruited to the SG to facilitate a multitude of mRNA fates. Although the precise role of the SG in stress adapation is not known, it is clear that an appropriate integrated stress response (ISR) is required for cells to survive in sub-optimal conditions. It was found that specific G3BP1 knockdown inhibited SG formation and cell survival, and this appeared to occur downstream of eIF2alpha; phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of eIFalpha; is the only factor known to be necessary for SG formation and cell survival. This data is the first to implicate SG formation itself, downstream of eIF2alpha; phosphorylation, in the survival phase of the ISR. The results also suggest that G3BP1 plays a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying stress adaptation. To facilitate future analysis of G3BP roles in the regulation of specific transcripts and in SG biology, a pilot study to identify G3BP RNA ligands was undertaken. Immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged G3BP1 from stable cell lines facilitated purification and isolation of RNA in association with G3BP1. Specific RNA transcripts were subsequently detected and identified by microarray. Many genes were enriched in the G3BP1 immunoprecipitate. Transcript enrichment in the control immunoprecipitate was comparatively weak and seemingly random, suggesting that several replicates will enable generation of a reliable target list. This work forms a promising basis for further investigations into G3BP functionality, and also provides a platform for broader and more large-scale analyses of the mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulation. The work presented in this thesis addressed the potential post-transcriptional mechanisms by which the G3BP family of proteins mediate cell proliferation and survival. Both G3BP1 and G3BP2 were shown to be over-expressed in tumours and each appeared to promote reporter gene expression. G3BP1 was also found to play a pivotal role in stress adaptation. A technique to identify novel RNA ligands was assessed, and it was found that G3BP1 may interact with various mRNA transcripts. It is hypothesised that the G3BP family of proteins, and in particular G3BP1, function to determine the fate of specific RNAs in response to cellular stress and other stimuli. In this way, G3BP proteins may facilitate appropriate responses to extra-cellular stimuli which allow for cell proliferation and survival.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RasGAP SH3 domain binding proteins</field><field name="subject">RNA metabolism</field><field name="subject">G3BP1 expression</field><field name="subject">G3BP2 expression</field><field name="subject">tumours</field><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">tumorigenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070705.175459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inter-Organisational Relationships for         Events Tourism Strategy Making in        Australian States and Territories</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Robyn L.</field><field name="description">This research examines the impact of inter-organisational relationships of public sector events agencies on events tourism strategy making within Australian state/territories. The global expansion of events tourism and sustained interest in networks and relationships as conduits to strategy underpin this topic. Although public sector institutional arrangements exist in many countries including Australia to develop events tourism, there is no known empirical research of inter-organisational relationships for strategy making in this domain. Against this background, the research problem of the thesis is:  How and why do inter-organisational relationships of public sector events agencies impact upon events tourism strategy making within Australian states and territories? Based on a review of themes and issues within the two parent theories of tourism strategy and inter-organisational relationships, a theoretical framework and four research issues are developed. These issues are: RI 1: How does the public sector institutional environment impact upon events tourism strategies and the inter-organisational relationships that shape them, and why? RI 2:  How do events tourism strategy forms and processes reflect and influence events agencies' inter-organisational relationships, and why? RI 3:	What are the forms and characteristics of events agencies' inter- organisational relationships for shaping events tourism strategies, and why? RI 4: What are the incentives and disincentives for events agencies to engage in inter-organisational relationships for events tourism strategy making, and why? Because this research explores a new field within events tourism, it adopts a realism paradigm to uncover the 'realities' of events agencies' inter-organisational relationships and strategies. Two qualitative methodologies are adopted: the convergent interview technique (Carson, Gilmore, Perry, and Gronhaug 2001b; Dick 1990) and multiple case research (Perry 1998, 2001; Yin 1994). The convergent interviews serve to explore and refine the theoretical framework and the four research issues investigated in the multiple case research. These cases are represented by the inter-organisational relationships of events agencies in six Australian states/territories.  Findings about the public sector institutional environment (research issue 1) show that events tourism strategies are influenced by different public sector policies and influences, the organisational arrangements for events tourism, the roles of events agencies and the lifecycle phase of events tourism in each state/territory. In relation to events tourism strategy forms (research issue 2), reactive/proactive strategies that respond to or address arising events or opportunities are common with a limited application of formal planning strategies. However, events agencies' strategy processes do reflect a range of strategic activities of importance. Inter-organisational relationships of events agencies (research issue 3) are typified by informal, government-led networks that influence, rather than develop, events tourism strategies. Finally, the importance of a number of incentives and disincentives for agencies to engage in inter-organisational relationships for events tourism strategy making is established. The final conceptual model depicts the themes within all four research issues and links between them to address the research problem. The conclusions of this research make a major contribution to events tourism theory and build upon theories in tourism strategy and inter-organisational relationships. Further research opportunities are presented by these conclusions and the conceptual model which may be explored using other methodologies or alternative research contexts. Practical implications of the research for policy makers and agency executives relate to policy-strategy linkages, public sector organisational arrangements for events tourism, strategy forms and processes and frameworks to engage stakeholders in inter-organisational relationships for strategy making. Knowledge of incentives and disincentives for these inter-organisational relationships also provides a platform for events agencies to reflect upon and revise their modes of governance for events tourism strategy making.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">event management</field><field name="subject">event marketing</field><field name="subject">events management</field><field name="subject">events marketing</field><field name="subject">events tourism</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">public sector agencies</field><field name="subject">strategy</field><field name="subject">strategic planning</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040218.160232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Security in WLAN With the Use of Smart Antennas</field><field name="creator">Sun, Zhaohui</field><field name="description">Wireless communication systems are increasingly deployed by family, businesses, government and SOHO users because of the freedom wireless communications afford, simplicity of installation and ease of use. Along with its rapid development, the security problem in wireless communication network has attracted more and more attention. It has been estimated that the IEEE 80.211 standard is susceptible to attacks both on data content and user authentication, such as eavesdropping, spoofing and Denial of Service. These attacks are due to the standard's inherent flaws and space signal sharing caused by the omni-directional antenna it usually uses. In recent years, few studies have been undertaken which examine the use of the smart directional antenna to mitigate the security risks in mobile wireless computing networks. One of the major reasons is the antenna size, as portability is a key requirement. Due to the dielectric-material embedding and FDTD optimal design technology, a smart antenna with controllable directionality can now achieve an overall volume reduction of 80%. This has promise for application in the wireless security realm. This thesis provides a conventional background in wireless computing networks and security theory. In addition, security level definition, program in Matlab&#153; and corresponding experimental results are provided. To show the effectiveness of improving security in WLAN with the use of a smart directional antenna, this thesis proposes a model for predicting electromagnetic environments using a directional transmission antenna based on the Finite Element method. To validate the numerical results, a new experimental method (using Network Stumbler software) to measure the signal strength in different locations is introduced. Results from experiments using the two methods are consistent. The latter method gives the users the possibility of using a laptop (with an appropriate wireless card, software and roguing around) to detect the real-time signal strength in different locations instead of using expensive measure apparatus. Such an advantage can be valuable for the efficient implementation of indoor wireless networks for security purposes. Finally, it contributes a security solution using DE-ESMB and DE-ESPAR smart antennas in WLAN. Through these simulated and experimental results, one can conclude that the security performance in WLAN can be greatly improved by using smart directional antenna. There are five chapters in this thesis: Chapter 1 introduces the wireless communication network. Information about architecture, topology and popular wireless standards is presented in this chapter. Chapter 2 investigates the security problem in IEEE 802.11 Standards. Recent improvements in security, and their limitations, are also included. This problem is investigated by performing laboratory experiments, including a real attack on 802.11 Standards and packet capture experiments using AiroPeek NX software. Chapter 3 describes the useful parameters of smart directional antennas, and then presents the security level definition in WLAN. Simple software in Matlab&#153; to determine the security level according to the beamwidth of the adopted antenna is also introduced. Chapter 4 is the important part of this thesis. Simulation results of signal strength in different locations using FEMLAB&#153; are presented, which are consistent with the follow-up experimental results carried out in a typical office area. This chapter also describes the final security solution using the newly-designed DE-ESMB and DE-ESPAR directional antennas. Chapter 5 is a summary of the thesis. It presents the conclusions and suggests area of future research for improving the security level using smart antennas in WLAN.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication</field><field name="subject">smart directional antenna</field><field name="subject">mobile wireless computing networks</field><field name="subject">Network Stumbler software</field><field name="subject">Wide Local Area Network</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070115.143811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Specific Migraine Candidate Genes Mapping to Human Chromosome 1</field><field name="creator">Sundholm, James</field><field name="description">Migraine, comprised of migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO), is a painful neurovascular disease, affecting approximately 16% of the general population. It is characterised by a wide variety of symptoms including headache, nausea and vomiting, and photo- and phonophobia. The disorder is complex involving not only multiple genes, but also specific environmental factors, which can induce attacks in genetically predisposed individuals. Hyperhomocysteinaemia is a known risk factor for cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular and coronary heart disease. The Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR) enzyme is involved in homocysteine metabolism.  Furthermore, it has been reported that a homozygous mutation (677C to T; Ala to Val) in the 5,10-MTHFR gene is associated with an elevation in plasma homocysteine levels (Frosst et al., 1995). This common mutation in the MTHFR gene has recently been associated with migraine with aura in a Japanese cohort (Kowa et al., 2000). The present study was designed to determine the prevalence of the MTHFR C677T mutation in Australian patients with migraine and to determine whether this mutation is associated with the disease in Caucasians. A large case-control study, consisting of 270 patients with migraine (167 with aura and 103 without aura), and 270 normal matched controls was investigated. Genotypic results indicated that the prevalence of the homozygous (T/T) genotype in migraine sufferers (15%) was higher than that of controls (9%) (P = 0.084). Furthermore, the frequency of the mutant (T/T) genotype in individuals with MA (19%) was significantly higher than in controls (9%) (P = 0.006).  Interestingly, the risk of MA was ~2.5-fold higher in suffers possessing the homozygous variant (OR = 2.52, CI: 1.42 - 4.47, P = 0.0012). To confirm the MTHFR allelic association with MA, family-based tests were performed in an independent pedigrees group, where only those with MA were considered affected. Results from both the Pedigree Disequilibrium Test (PDT) and Family-Based Association Test (FBAT) analysis revealed slight, although not significant (PDT test, P = 132; and FBAT test, P = 0.390), over-transmission of the mutant allele (T) from parents to affected offspring. However, despite the MTHFR variant having a high heterozygosity (0.48), there were a limited number of informative transmissions for the MTHFR variant in the pedigree group resulting in reduced power for these tests. In conclusion, our results support the trends reported in the Japanese migraine study and suggest that the homozygous 677T gene variant causing mild hyperhomocysteinaemia, is a genetic risk factor for migraine, and indicate that further studies investigating the role of this gene are warranted. Mutations in various ion channel genes are responsible for neurovascular and other neurological disorders. Inherited ion channel mutations or "channelopathies" are increasingly found to be the cause of various neurological disorders in humans. Wittekindt and colleagues (1998) reported that the calcium-activated potassium channel (hKCa3) gene is a good candidate for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD), as well as for other neurological disorders such as migraine. The hKCa3 gene is a neuronal small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, which contains a polyglutamine tract, encoded by a polymorphic CAG repeat in the gene. The hKCa3 gene encodes a protein of 731 amino acids containing two adjacent polyglutamine sequences in its N-terminal domain separated by 25 amino acids. The C-terminal polyglutamine sequence is highly polymorphic in length (Austin et al., 1999). hKCa3 plays a critical role in determining the firing pattern of neurons via the generation of slow after-polarization pulses and the regulation of intracellular calcium channels (Kohler et al., 1996). Three distinct mutations in the a1 calcium channel gene have been shown to cause SCA-6, episodic ataxia-2 and familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) (Ophoff et al., 1996). The hKCa3 gene contains a highly polymorphic CAG repeat that was initially mapped (Chandy et al., 1997) to a schizophrenia locus on chromosome 22 (Pulver et al., 1994). Recently Austin et al (1999) re-mapped hKCa3 and found it to reside on chromosome 1q21, a region that has been linked to FHM (Austin et al., 1999), a rare subtype of MA (Ducros et al., 1997; Gardner et al., 1998), and a region recently showing genetic linkage to typical migraine (Lea et al., 2002). The hKCa3 polymorphism results in small variations in polyglutamine number, similar to those that occur in the calcium channel a1a subunit gene (CACNA1A), which is encoded by CAG expansions and thought to cause Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 6 via loss of channel function (Austin et al., 1999). Given the recent linkage of FHM to the region of chromosome 1q21, to which hKCa3 resides, and also linkage of typical migraine to this region, a large case-control study investigating this hKCa3 CAG marker and consisting of 270 migraine and 270 stringently matched healthy controls was undertaken. Our results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in allele distributions for this marker between migraine and non-migraine patients (P &gt;0.05). No significant difference in the allelic distribution was observed in the MA or MO groups when compared to controls (P &gt;0.05) and there was no significant difference in CAG repeat length distribution between the migraine group and controls (P = 0.92), or between the MA and MO groups (P = 0.72) collectively.  Hence, the CAG repeat in this gene does not show expansion in migraine. Overall, our results provide no genetic evidence to suggest that the hKCa3 CAG repeat polymorphism is involved in migraine aetiology in Australian Caucasians. Thus the involvement of the hKCa3 gene in migraine is not likely, although the hKCa3 gene remains an important candidate for other neurological disorders that may be linked to the 1q21.3 chromosomal region.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">migraine</field><field name="subject">migraines</field><field name="subject">headache</field><field name="subject">headaches</field><field name="subject">migrain candidate genes</field><field name="subject">human chromosomes</field><field name="subject">gene mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030829.153348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated, Intelligent Sensor Fabrication Strategies for Environmental Monitoring</field><field name="creator">Suzuki, Takeharu</field><field name="description">The humidity, temperature, wind speed/direction micro sensors can be manufactured individually, resulting in three individual substrates. The integration of the three sensors into a single substrate is a vital challenge to achieve an integrated intelligent sensor so called a multiple sensor. This requires the integration of process flows and is a major challenge because adequate sensor performance must be maintained. Polyimide was selected as a humidity sensing material for its compatibility with conventional integrated circuit fabrication technology, negligible temperature dependence and good resistance against contamination. Nickel was selected for the temperature and wind speed/direction sensor because of its useful temperature coefficient and the advantage of its cost. Since the known wet etchant for nickel requires hard-baked photoresist, a method which does not attack the polyimide while removing the photoresist must be developed. The method developed for etching nickel employs hard-bake-free photoresist. Other challenge was ensuring good thermal isolation for the wind speed/direction sensor fabricated on a silicon nitride layer preformed on top of a silicon wafer. Since silicon acts as a good heat sink, the silicon under the sensor was etched entirely away until the silicon nitride layer was reached. This structure achieved good thermal isolation resulting in small power consumption. This low power feature is essential for sensors deployed in fields where power access or replacement of power sources is restricted. This structure was compared with the structure created by polyimide plateau on a silicon nitride layer coated on a silicon substrate as a function of power consumption. Based on the examination of thermal isolation, the multiple sensor utilizing a MEMS technique was fabricated with a single-sided mask aligner. The characteristics of humidity sensors fabricated with polyimide were examined in detail with respect to variations of electrode structures, improvement of sensitivity, effect of process temperature, temperature and frequency dependence, and stability. The humidity sensor constructed with O2 plasma treated polyimide resulted an improvement in sensitivity and hysteresis. The investigation using XPS, FTIR and AFM concluded the chemical modification of polyimide played an important role in this improvement. The design, fabrication and results of a series of humidity sensors are quantified. There is always no unique packaging solution for sensors because of the application-specific nature of the sensors. This intelligent environmental monitoring system was designed to accommodate both an environmental sensor and its signal conditioning electronics circuitry (SICONEC) into a single package. The environmental sensors need direct exposure to the environment while SICONEC needs a sealed encapsulation to avoid environmental damage. A new style of packaging addressing these requirements was demonstrated using a hot embossing machine. The hot embossing machine was used to embed an integrated circuit (IC) in a bare die condition into a polycarbonate (PC) sheet. In this case, the IC was flipped down against the PC, which protects the front side of the IC from the environmental damages. In a test phase, a die containing operational amplifiers was embossed into the PC. A humidity sensor and surface mount resisters were placed on the same surface of the PC to test the validity of this new technique. Interconnection between the embossed die and the humidity sensor was established using bonding wires. Copper tracks were also used to ensure all electrical connections for the die, the humidity sensor and the resistors. The results clarified the method developed. Details of process methods, issues and further potential improvement are reported.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polyimide</field><field name="subject">polyimides</field><field name="subject">microsensor</field><field name="subject">microsensors</field><field name="subject">multiple sensors</field><field name="subject">humidity</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">wind speed</field><field name="subject">wind direction</field><field name="subject">O2 plasma treated polyimide</field><field name="subject">environmental sensors</field><field name="subject">microelectronics</field><field name="subject">microelectronic engineering</field><field name="subject">environmental monitoring</field><field name="subject">fabrication</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040813.131206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hox Transcription Factors: Their Involvement in Human Cancer Cells and In Vitro Functional Specificity</field><field name="creator">Svingen, Terje</field><field name="description">Hox genes are regulatory genes encoding small proteins containing a highly conserved 61-amino acid motif, the homeodomain, that enables Hox proteins to bind to DNA at specifically recognised binding sites and transcriptionally activate their target genes. In mammalian species there are 39 Hox genes and they are structural and functional homologs of the Drosophila homeotic complex (Horn-C). During embryogenesis and early development the Hox genes are expressed in a spatiotemporal fashion, where they operate as master transcriptional regulators. Hox genes are further expressed in fully differentiated adult cells, potentially in a tissue-specific manner involving maintenance of the normal phenotype. In selected oncogenic transformations, dysregulated Hox gene expression has been observed, indicating an involvement of these transcriptional regulators in carcinogenesis and metastasis. Utilising quantitative real-time PCR assays, these studies investigated the expression patterns of 20 Hox genes and two wellcharacterised Hox cofactors (Pbx and Meis) in malignant and non-malignant human breast and skin cancer cells. Dysregulated Hox expression was observed for all malignancies tested, of which some misexpressed Hox genes seemed random, whereas other Hox transcripts showed altered levels potentially corresponding with the invasive capacity of the cells. Also, the Hox cofactors Pbx and Meis showed no marked changes in expression levels from the non-malignant to the malignant phenotypes, indicating that it is dysregulated Hox gene expression rather than dysregulated gene expression of Hox cofactors that potentially commit the cell to redifferentiate and undergo oncogenic transformation. Although the Hox proteins are known to be key transcriptional regulators of development, the mechanisms by which they gain their in vivo functional specificity is still largely unknown. They all show strikingly similar transcriptional specificity in vitro, yet show unique specificity in their in vivo environment. This paradox has been the subject of intense scrutiny, however very few direct Hox target genes have been identified, making it a difficult task to decipher the exact manner in which Hox proteins exert their functional potential. Therefore, the studies presented herein were aimed at identifying further Hox target genes in the human system. Utilising differential display approaches, several potential downstream target genes were isolated. Substantiated with real-time PCR assays, one of these potential targets was selected as a likely direct Hox gene target, and as such subjected to further studies. By the combination of bioinformatic analyses, transfection protocols and luciferase assays, a gene encoding the SR-related protein SRrpl3O was shown to be trans-activated in vitro by HOXD4 via a putative Hox binding element within its promoter region. This is the first reported link between Hox transcription factors and the SR and SR-related family of pre-mRNA splicing proteins, offering a new and exciting insight into the complex nature of Hox functional specificity. Finally, this thesis also puts forward new ideas regarding how the Hox proteins gain their transcriptional and functional specificity. Utilising bioinformatic tools in conjunction with performing an extensive review of the disparate catalogue of Hox-related research reports, work herein offers the first comprehensive analysis of the mammalian Hox gene targets in relation to their promoter structures, as well as with respect to the expanded Hox DNA-binding elements. This work reports that identified Hox targets generally contain TATA-less core promoters, many of which have several GC-box elements. The Hox binding elements show no apparent preference regarding their location relative to the transcription start site (TSS), as they are found both upstream and downstream of the TSS, as well as being located close to proximal core promoter elements for some genes and at more distant positions in other gene promoters. Finally, the core Hox binding element TAAT/ATTA contains only part of the necessary recognition sequence involved in Hox-DNA binding, and the notion that flanking base pairs dictate trans-regulatory potential is further explored with the hypothesis that the immediate 3' base pair dictates an activator/repressor-switch of the Hox trans-regulatory effect.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hox genes</field><field name="subject">regulatory genes</field><field name="subject">oncogenic transformations</field><field name="subject">Hox proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050830.135356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adult Adjustment to Relationship Separation</field><field name="creator">Sweeper, Susie</field><field name="description">Relationship separation is prevalent in Western society and ongoing problems for adults and children are common, resulting in high personal and social costs. A literature review revealed that no existing measure of separation adjustment assessed multiple domains of separation adjustment, and was psychometrically sound. Additionally, a literature review revealed that few studies have investigated change in separation adjustment over time using cognitive predictors. This thesis is a program of research investigating separation adjustment in recently separated adults. Five studies were conducted with three main aims: (1) to develop a multidimensional, psychometrically reliable and valid measure of separation adjustment; (2) to assess the trajectory of separation adjustment over time; and (3) to test the hypothesis that certain cognitive variables predict the trajectory of separation adjustment. A conceptualisation of separation adjustment was developed consisting of the following five domains: Connection to the former partner, loneliness and emotional negativity (referred to as lonely negativity), parenting negotiation, parent-child relationship and general psychological adjustment. The Problems After Separation Test (PAST) was developed to reflect the first four of the five domains. In Study 1, 268 participants separated for up to 18 months, were recruited to assess the factor structure and internal consistency of the PAST. In Study 2, 209 participants were recruited to assess the stability of the factor structure, and temporal stability. In Study 3, participants from Study 2 were used to obtain convergent and divergent validity. The results of the first three studies showed that separation adjustment is a multidimensional construct, and that the PAST is a reliable and valid measure of separation adjustment. Study 4 aimed to assess the trajectory of separation adjustment over a 6 month period using the PAST and another measure of general psychological adjustment. Participants from both Study 1 and 2 were used, and a longitudinal cohort sequential design was employed. The sample consisted of three cohorts: those separated for up to six months, those separated between 6 and 12 months, and those separated between 12 and 18 months. The results showed that connection to the former partner, lonely negativity, and general psychological adjustment improved over time, but parent-child relationships and parenting negotiation were stable, and chronic parenting problems were common. Men showed greater parent-child relationship problems than women, possibly because men were most likely to be the non-resident parent. Participants separating from a de facto relationship reported only slightly more problems on lonely negativity, general psychological distress and parent-child relationships than participants separating from a marriage. Study 4 also provides information on clinical and reliable change, suggested cut-offs that might be used to define normal, moderate and severe adjustment problems, and attrition analyses. Using participants from Study 2, Study 5 aimed to assess cognitive predictors of change on connection to the former partner, lonely negativity and psychological distress. The cognitions assessed at each data collection were dysfunctional attitudes, attachment style, causal attributions, threat appraisal, and self-efficacy. Causal attributions were obtained by asking participants "For three minutes tell my about the problems you had in your relationship and what lead to the separation". The responses were transcribed, a coding manual was devised, and inter-rater reliability of coding was good. Cross-sectionally, the majority of cognitions were associated with one or more domains of separation adjustment, however longitudinally, cognitions did not predict change in separation adjustment over a 6-month period. Cognitions themselves were found to be somewhat variable, which is not surprising given that stressful life events, such as relationship separation would alter cognitions. Other variables that might be responsible for changes in separation adjustment trajectory are discussed. The results of the combined 5 studies have both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, separation adjustment is a construct made up of distinct domains which have different trajectories. Connection, lonely negativity and psychological adjustment generally represent transient problems. Although the current research found that a non-trivial minority of participants continued to show distress on these domains two years post separation. On the other hand, parenting negotiation and the parent-child relationship was a chronic problem for many separated people, particularly men. Practically, the results of the current research suggests that most therapeutic attention should be directed towards improving parenting adjustment post separation. Limitations of the current research and suggestions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">separation</field><field name="subject">separated couples</field><field name="subject">divorce</field><field name="subject">divorced couples</field><field name="subject">relationship</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">partner</field><field name="subject">partners</field><field name="subject">adjustment</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">families</field><field name="subject">adult</field><field name="subject">adults</field><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">parent-child relationship</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041012.112619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exchange Rate Pass-Through in a Small Open Economy: the Case of Australian Export Prices</field><field name="creator">Swift, Robyn</field><field name="description">Expectations regarding the relationship between exchange rates and the prices of traded goOds in small open economies have traditionally been derived from the idea of the relative unimportance of a single small country when trading in much larger international markets. This concept has led to the use of distinct 'small-country' or 'dependent-economy' models to analyse the effects of macroeconomic changes. Thus for small economies like Australia, it is usually assumed that the foreign-currency prices of traded goods are fixed in perfectly competitive international markets. Accordingly, exchange rate movements must be completely absorbed in domestic-currency prices. In other words, the pass-through of exchange rate changes to destination-currency prices must be zero for Australian exports, and complete for Australian imports. Such expectations regarding the degree of exchange rate pass-through contrast sharply with those found in conventional macroeconomic models for large countries, in which pass-through is assumed to be complete for all traded goods. Moreover, they conflict with the results derived from the large theoretical and empirical literature on the microeconomic determinants of pass-through, which suggests that much international trade takes place in imperfectly competitive markets, in which the degree of less-than-complete pass-through depends on industry-specific factors. This study explores these apparent conflicts by re-examining the small-country assumption, with particular emphasis on export prices as the area of greatest divergence. Specifically, it addresses three research questions: 1) What are the theoretical conditions that underlie the small-country assumption? 2)What are the implications for the macroeconomic models of small economies if this assumption is violated? 3) In practice, is the data more consistent with the validity or otherwise of the assumption? The analysis focuses on Australia as a practical example of a small open economy with a high proportion of commodity exports. In summary, the theoretical and empirical results reported in this study suggest that the small-country assumption is unlikely to hold in practice. That is, exchange rate pass-through is more likely to be determined by industry-specific factors, rather than by the universal conclusion of zero pass-through for all Australian exports that is derived from the small-country assumption. Further, they imply that the movement in internal prices required to restore equilibrium in a small country following an external shock is likely to be both larger and more uncertain than has previously been expected. Under such circumstances, the full flexibility of the exchange rate, as the primary and most rapid source of the required adjustments, becomes particularly significant. An important policy implication for small open economies that are subject to frequent terms of trade shocks, such as Australia, is that attempts to manage the exchange rate in order to reduce apparently excessive movements may in fact result in a longer and more protracted process of adjustment through the labour market.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exchange rates</field><field name="subject">export prices</field><field name="subject">exchange rate pass through</field><field name="subject">Australian economy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050921.140213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene Expression Analysis and Genetic Studies in Multiple Sclerosis</field><field name="creator">Tajouri, Lotfi</field><field name="description">Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS). As part of this disorder the myelin sheath undergoes degeneration, leading to alterations in the conductivity of axons, and impaired function. The onset of the disease occurs in young adults and clinical pathology is characterised by varying severity. These include i) Relapsing Remitting MS (RR-MS), ii) Secondary Progressive MS (SP-MS) and iii) Primary Progressive MS (PP-MS). MS is more prevalent in women and accounts for more than two thirds of all MS sufferers. MS is considered to be a multifactorial disorder with both genetic and environmental components. The prevalence of MS is dependent on geographical localisation, with lower sunlight exposure linked to higher prevalence. Also, studies show an increased risk in close relatives, or in identical twins, indicating a significant genetic component to the disorder. There are a number of genes that may plausibly be involved in MS pathophysiology. These include myelin-related genes, such as the myelin basic protein (MBP), immune-related genes, such FC receptor and osteopontin, and heat shock proteins such as xb crystallin. These candidate genes have been implicated in a variety of ways but usually through immunological and/or genetic studies.  One of the most consistent findings in recent years has been the association of disease with alterations in the specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) localised to chromosome 6p21.3, and includes MHC I, II, III. Genome wide screens have permitted the identification of loci in the genome, which are associated with MS susceptibility. The number of genes involved in MS is unknown and several case-control association studies have been undertaken to reveal the involvement of potential candidate genes. In general terms, current research is aimed at determining allelic variation of candidate genes. Such genes have been implicated in MS because they reside within susceptible regions of the chromosome associated with MS or they have a plausible potential pathophysiological role in MS. Candidate loci investigated in this study, for association with MS susceptibility, include members of the nitric oxide synthase family of metabolic proteins (inducible NOS, iNOS/NOS2A and neuronal NOS, nNOS), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), and vitamin D receptor (VDR). The MS population used in all studies consisted of over 100 MS cases and gender, age and ethnicity matched controls. In our study of inducible and neuronal NOS genes, PCR based assays were developed to amplify a region of both promoters that contained known microsatellite variation. Supporting phyisological data suggests that the neuroinflammatory aspects of MS are associated with aberrant NO production, which may be due to aberrant regulation of NOS activity. Specific amplified products were identified by fluorescent capillary electrophoresis and allele frequencies were statistically compared using chi-squared analysis. In the nNOS and iNOS study, no association was identified with allele frequency variation and MS susceptibility (nNOS: ?2=5.63, P=0.962; iNOS: ?2=3.4; P=0.082). Similarly, no differences in allele frequencies were observed for gender or clinical course for both markers (Pvalue greater than 0.05). In short, results from this study indicate that the NOS promoter variations studied do not play a significant role in determining susceptibility to MS in the tested population. The COMT and MTHFR genes are localised at 22q12-13 and 1p36.3 respectively, regions of the genome that have been found to be positively associated with MS susceptibility. In our research, we set out to examine the G158A change in the 4th exon of the COMT gene.  This functional mutation leads to an amino acid change (valine to methionine) that is directly associated with changes in the activity of COMT.  The MTHFR enzyme plays a role in folate metabolism, and can be implicated in the turnover of homocysteine. Previous investigations have shown that high levels of homocysteine are encountered in MS patients, where it is also linked to demyelination in the CNS.  In our study the aim was to examine the C677T variation (alanine to valine amino acid change) in the exon 4 coding region of the MTHFR gene and the G158A variation in the COMT gene. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and gel electrophoresis was used to identify specific alleles for both COMT and MTHFR. However, as with the NOS study, no specific association was identified between MS susceptibility and variation for either of the tested COMT or MTHFR (Pvalue greater than 0.05) variants. In a final genomic investigation of the MS population, three variations in the VDR gene were analysed for association with MS susceptibility and pathology. Using RFLP analysis, three VDR variants were investigated with genotypes detected using the Taq I, Apa I and Fok I restriction enzymes. In contrast to previous genotypic analyses, this study did show a positive association, specifically between the functional variation in exon 9 of the VDR gene and MS (Taq I,  2= 7.22, P= 0.0072).  Interestingly, the Apa I variant of VDR was also found to be associated with MS ( 2=4.2, P=0.04). The Taq I and Apa I variants were also found to be in very strong and significant linkage disequilibrium (D'=0.96, Pvalue less than 0.0001) and their associations were more prominent with the progressive forms of MS (SP-MS and PP-MS). In addition to genotypic analysis of a clinical population, additional research was undertaken to identify novel targets for MS susceptibility studies. Global gene expression analysis was undertaken using comparative subtractive fluorescent microarray technology to examine differences in gene activity (expression) in age and sex matched MS plaque tissue and anatomically matched normal white matter (NWM). MS plaques were obtained post mortem from MS sufferers with no drug history in the last two months before death and matched anatomically to healthy white matter from donors with no previous neurological disorders. Target arrays consisted of 5000 cDNAs and analysis was conducted using the Affymetrix 428 scanner. In this way, 139 genes were shown to be differentially regulated in MS plaque tissue compared to NWM. Of these, 69 genes showed a common pattern of expression in the chronic active and acute plaque tissues investigated (Pvalue less than 0.0001, a=0.73); while 70 transcripts were uniquely differentially expressed ( 1.5-fold) in either acute or chronic active lesions. To validate the gene expression profile results, quantitative real time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR (Q-PCR) analysis was performed. 12 genes were selected because they were shown to be differentially expressed by array analysis in this study, or because of their involvement in MS pathology. These included transferrin (TF), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1), crystallin, alpha-B (CRYAB), phosphomannomutase 1 (PMM1), tubulin beta-5 (TBB5), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase B (ITPKB), calpain 1 (CAPNS1), osteopontin (SPP1 or OPN), as well as the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1). Both absolute (copy number) and comparative differences in the relative levels of expression in MS lesions and NWM were determined for each gene. The results from this study revealed a significant correlation of real time PCR results with the microarray data, while a significant correlation was also found between comparative and absolute determinations of fold.  As with the results of array analysis, a significant difference in gene expression patterning was identified between chronic active and acute plaque pathologies. For example, a up to 50-fold increase in SPP1 and ITPKB levels in acute plaques contrasted with the 5-fold or less increase in chronic active plaques (P less than 0.0.1, unpaired t-Test). Of particular note, gamma-amino butyric acid receptor ?2 (GABG2), integrin ?5 (ITGB5), complement component 4B (C4B), parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTHR1) were found up-regulated in MS and glial derived neurotropic factor ?2 (GDNFA2), insulin receptor (INSR), thyroid hormone receptor ZAKI4 (ZAKI4) were found down-regulated in MS.  Data also revealed a decreased expression of the immune related genes STAT1 and PIAS1 in acute plaques. In conclusion, this research used both genomic analysis and technologies in gene expression to investigate both known and novel markers of MS pathology and susceptibility. The study developed tools that may be used for further investigation of clinical pathology in MS and have provided interesting initial expression data to further investigate the genes that play a role in MS development and progression.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multiple sclerosis</field><field name="subject">neurodegenerative disease</field><field name="subject">multifactorial disorder</field><field name="subject">nitric oxide synthase</field><field name="subject">NOS</field><field name="subject">iNOS/NOS2A</field><field name="subject">neuronal NOS</field><field name="subject">nNos</field><field name="subject">MTHFR</field><field name="subject">COMT</field><field name="subject">VDR</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060111.123933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Primacy of Moral Philosophy: Dugald Stewart and the Scottish Enlightenment</field><field name="creator">Tannoch-Bland, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Dugald Stewart was an influential teacher and philosopher during the final years of the Scottish Enlightenment.  Until recently he has been seen as merely a significant expositor of Thomas Reid's common sense philosophy.  This thesis does not attempt to assess the novelty of Stewart's writings in relation to his Scottish predecessors such as Reid: rather, it offers a detailed historical study of aspects of his work, placing them in the political and cultural context of the period following the French Revolution. Two questions stimulated this thesis.  First, what prompted Stewart, a moral philosopher who was not an experimental philosopher, to write a major work on methodology?  Second, why was there a gap of twenty-two years between the first volume of his Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind (1792) and the second (1814), which contained his methodological treatise?  I aim to answer these questions by offering a contextual intellectual history of some important aspects of Stewart's work. The thesis argues that Stewart faced a new problem: he had to deal with attacks on moral philosophy - the core subject of the Edinburgh University curriculum - some of which were produced by institutional and political factors affecting the Scottish universities, others by the rising authority of the experimental physical sciences.  I consider a selection of Stewart's writings in the light of this problem. In 1804 Stewart's own student, Francis Jeffrey, gave public voice to the charge that the science of mind (which constituted the central part of Scottish common sense philosophy) was outdated, unscientific and useless.  Thereafter, Stewart was engaged in what he saw as an urgent task - the defence of the very status of philosophy and the role of the philosopher.  The thesis considers some of his major works (and other writings) from this perspective:  Philosophical Essays (1810) contained his first direct retort to Jeffrey;  Stewart's treatment of methodology in Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, Volume 2 (1814) and his section on intellectual character in Volume 3 (1827) are viewed as two significant components of his attempt to reassert the primacy of moral philosophy and the role of the moral philosopher.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stewart</field><field name="subject">Dugald</field><field name="subject">1753-1818--Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Scottish</field><field name="subject">common sense</field><field name="subject">Scottish Enlightenment</field><field name="subject">moral philosophy</field><field name="subject">philosophical</field><field name="subject">philosopher</field><field name="subject">philosophers</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030303.100636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Functioning in Preschool Children: Can Social Information Processing and Self-Regulation Skills Explain Sex Differences and Play a Role in Preventing Ongoing Problems?</field><field name="creator">Teague, Rosemary Judith Patricia</field><field name="description">A consistent finding in the literature is that children who demonstrate lower levels of social functioning (i.e., exhibit high levels of externalising and internalising problems and low levels of socially competent behaviour) have problems interpreting social cues and enacting appropriate behavioural responses in social situations (that is, they have poor social information processing (SIP) skills). Another consistent finding is that children who demonstrate lower levels of social functioning have problems regulating behaviour and/or emotions (that is, they have poor self-regulation skills). The research questions in this study explore two related issues: whether these associations can explain sex differences in social functioning (with girls consistently exhibiting higher levels of social competence and lower levels of externalising problems than boys) and whether an intervention targeting SIP and self-regulation skills can lead to improvements in social functioning. The study forms one component of a larger developmental prevention project (the Pathways to Prevention Project) which involves the provision of an integrated set of intervention strategies to children attending preschools in a highly disadvantaged Brisbane suburb. It also involves programs with their families, their schools and relevant ethnic communities. This study relates to a sub-sample of 308 children who participated solely in the social skills program. Children from two preschools received the program (N=174) and were compared with children from two other preschools who did not receive the program (N=134). The research questions were addressed using a repeated measures design, with data being collected from all intervention and comparison children pre- and post-intervention (that is, at the beginning and end of the school year) and at a one year follow-up at the end of Grade 1. The study is unique as it involves Australian children from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, many of whom who are non-English speaking. Few studies have involved such diverse samples and none have been implemented in an Australian context. The first two research questions seek to confirm findings from prior studies, examining whether females exhibit higher levels of social functioning than males and whether there is a significant relationship between social functioning and SIP and self-regulation skills. The third research question significantly extends prior findings by examining whether there are sex differences in SIP and self-regulation skills and whether these can account for sex differences in social functioning. This issue has been largely overlooked in the literature. The fourth research question examines whether a social skills intervention designed to improve preschool children's SIP and self-regulatory skills can lead to improvements in these skills and increase levels of social functioning. The fifth research question examines the relative effect of the intervention for boys and girls. Using pre-intervention data, the study confirmed prior research, finding significant sex differences in social functioning with girls exhibiting higher levels of social competence and lower levels of externalising problems. A significant relationship was also found between measures of SIP, self-regulation skills and social functioning. A significant sex difference was found in SIP and self-regulation skills, with girls performing better than boys on these measures. After adjusting for children's scores on the SIP measure, sex differences in social competence were no longer significant. Sex differences in externalising problems remained significant but were markedly reduced. A similar pattern of findings was observed when adjusting for self-regulation skills. These findings represent a major contribution to the understanding of sex differences in social functioning. In comparison to non-participants, participants in the social skills program demonstrated significant improvements in SIP, self-regulation skills and social competence which were sustained 12 months after the completion of the intervention. In general, program participation was not found to be associated with changes in children's levels of externalising and internalising behaviour problems, although there were strong and significant reductions in externalising behaviour problems for disruptive children who were consistently engaged with the program. Program effects were greatest where it was consistently reinforced by teachers. No significant sex differences in program effects were found. Implications for future policy are that child-focused programs designed to increase school readiness and levels of social competence should include SIP and self-regulation components. More intensive programs may be required for long term improvements in behaviour problems. In terms of future practice, it is concluded that the implementation and evaluation of programs for young disadvantaged children from a range of multi-cultural backgrounds must limit English language requirements to increase program engagement, and encourage parental involvement using strategies such as parent training groups that do not demand high levels of parental literacy. Teacher involvement also needs to be maximised either through the provision of teacher training or through intensive mentoring.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social functioning in preschool children</field><field name="subject">socially competent behaviour</field><field name="subject">social information processing</field><field name="subject">self-regulation skills</field><field name="subject">preschool children</field><field name="subject">sex differences in preschool behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061106.132840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tidal Dynamics in Coastal Aquifers</field><field name="creator">Teo, Hhih-Ting</field><field name="description">The prediction of coastal groundwater movement is necessary in coastal management. However, the study in this field is still a great challenge due to the involvement of tidal-groundwater interactions and the phenomena of hydrodynamic dispersion between salt-fresh water in the coastal region. To date, numerous theories for groundwater dynamic have been made available in analytical, numerical and also experimental forms. Nevertheless, most of them are based on the zeroth-order shallow flow, i.e. Boussinesq approximation. Two main components for coastal unconfined aquifer have been completed in this Thesis: the vertical beach model and the sloping beach model. Both solutions are solved in closed-form up to higher order with shallow water parameter ([epsilon]) and tidal amplitude parameter ([alpha]). The vertical beach solution contributes to the higher-order tidal fluctuations while the sloping beach model overcomes the shortcomings in the existing solutions. From this study, higher-order components are found to be significant especially for larger value of [alpha] and [epsilon]. Other parameters such as hydraulic conductivity (K) and the thickness of aquifer (D) also affect the water table fluctuations. The new sloping solution demonstrated the significant influence of beach slope ([beta]) on the water table fluctuations. A comprehensive comparison between previous solution and the present sloping solution have been performed mathematically and numerically and the present solution has been demonstrated to provide a better prediction</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tidal dynamics</field><field name="subject">coastal aquifers</field><field name="subject">aquifer</field><field name="subject">hydraulic conductivity</field><field name="subject">tidal fluctuation</field><field name="subject">sloping beach</field><field name="subject">soil porosity</field><field name="subject">Boussinesq equation</field><field name="subject">vertical beach</field><field name="subject">coastal groundwater movement</field><field name="subject">beaches</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030729.155028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community-Based Research: An Opportunity for Collaboration and Social Change</field><field name="creator">Thomsen, Dana Christine</field><field name="description">Natural resource managers are facing increasing challenges as environmental degradation accelerates and the need to integrate a broad spectrum of community experiences into management decisions is increasingly recognised.  To help meet these novel challenges, this study explores how professional researchers and communities can combine their skills and learn to work in partnerships to achieve shared management goals. Community-based research involves people as citizen scientists, whereby citizens actively participate in research on local issues.  The inclusive nature of community-based research has the ability to produce auxiliary benefits uncommon in conventional research. These include the development of social capital and social learning as the practice of citizen science empowers communities with new skills, knowledge and social networks, thus building capacity within communities to take an effective role in natural resource management.  Community-based research also has the potential to enrich the range of management options available by increasing the breadth of accessible knowledge.  However, despite much rhetoric about democratising science, little is known about the practice, value and problems of involving citizens as collaborators in natural resource management research projects. This thesis presents the findings from a comparative survey of the attitudes to community-based research held by 'citizen' scientists, on the one hand, and 'expert' scientists and natural resource managers, on the other.  It also draws upon a multi-site case study, set in a diverse urban-rural catchment, where an integrated research program was established for different natural resource management agencies to work with each other and community groups to develop research protocols so that community groups could participate in assessing the health of catchment areas.  This involved scientists, natural resource managers and community education/extension officers working with established community groups to develop and trial modified scientific methods for the environmental monitoring of catchment and estuarine areas.  This inter-agency/community project was continued as a case study site into the second and third years of research and was augmented in the second and third years by focusing on two of the initial community groups as second and third case study sites in their own right. Synthesis of both survey and case study analysis reveals that, despite resource and attitudinal barriers, community-based research can ensure access to local knowledge and increased relevance of research.  In addition, many participants most valued the increased feeling of connection towards their local environment and community.  I argue that citizen/expert collaboration is key to successful community-based research and best achieved in an atmosphere of mutual respect where all participants are seen as co-researchers.  However, participatory intentions are unlikely to be acted upon without sufficient opportunity.  Thus, the process of research must be re-defined from that associated with positivist science to include a greater range of participants and activities in an adaptive manner.  This more inclusive and reflective approach seems most likely to ensure the quality and utility of research data, the knowledge sharing and social learning, and the enjoyable atmosphere that underpin successful citizen/expert interactions.  Certainly, the ability to draw upon and create social capital is vital. The integration of these findings enabled the development of guidelines for effective collaboration between citizens and experts when addressing catchment management issues and undertaking participatory research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community-based research</field><field name="subject">community participation</field><field name="subject">citizen participation</field><field name="subject">environmental research</field><field name="subject">environmental scientists</field><field name="subject">natural resource management</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">partnership</field><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">scientific method</field><field name="subject">expert</field><field name="subject">expertise</field><field name="subject">experts</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050323.174017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using Quantum Feedback to Control Nonclassical Correlations in Light and Atoms</field><field name="creator">Thomsen, Laura Kathrine Wehde</field><field name="description">This thesis considers two types of applications of quantum feedback control; feedback creation of
nonclassical states of light, and controlling nonclassical properties of an ensemble of atoms. An electro-optical feedback loop will create an in-loop field with nonclassical photon statistics similar to squeezed light, resulting in fluorescence line-narrowing of a two-level atom coupled to such light. We extend this theory to study a three-level atom coupled to broadband squashed light, and confirm the two-level atom line-narrowing using a more realistic non-Markovian description of the feedback loop. The second type of application utilizes continuous QND measurement of atomic ensembles. If we measure the collective spin, then the system experiences conditional spin squeezing dependent on the measurement results. We show that feedback based on these results can continuously drive the system into the same conditioned state, resulting in deterministically reproducible spin squeezing. If we measure the atom number fluctuations of a BEC, then, due to the nonlinearity of atomic self interactions, this is also information about phase fluctuations. We show that feedback based on this information can greatly reduce the collisional broadening of the linewidth of an atom laser out-coupled from the condensate.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum feedback control</field><field name="subject">nonclassical states of light</field><field name="subject">atom</field><field name="subject">atomic</field><field name="subject">atoms</field><field name="subject">correlation</field><field name="subject">correlations</field><field name="subject">collison</field><field name="subject">collisions</field><field name="subject">spin</field><field name="subject">light</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040406.124012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constraint Weighting Local Search for Constraint Satisfaction</field><field name="creator">Thornton, John Richard</field><field name="description">One of the challenges for the constraint satisfaction community has been to develop an automated approach to solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) rather than creating specific algorithms for specific problems. Much of this work has concentrated on the development and improvement of general purpose backtracking techniques. However, the success of relatively simple local search techniques on larger satisfiability problems [Selman et a!. 1992] and CSPs such as the n-queens [Minton et al. 1992] has caused interest in applying local search to constraint satisfaction. In this thesis we look at the usefulness of constraint weighting as a local search technique for constraint satisfaction. The work is based on the clause weighting ideas of Selman and Kautz [1993] and Moths [1993] and applies, evaluates and extends these ideas from the satisfiability domain to the more general domain of CSPs. Specifically, the contributions of the thesis are: 1. The introduction of a local search taxonomy. We examine the various better known local search techniques and recognise four basic strategies: restart, randomness, memory and weighting. 2. The extension of the CSP modelling framework. In order to represent and efficiently solve more realistic problems we extend the C SP modelling framework to include array-based domains and array-based domain use constraints. 3. The empirical evaluation of constraint weighting. We compare the performance of three constraint weighting strategies on a range of CSP and satisflability problems and with several other local search techniques. We find that no one technique dominates in all problem domains. 4. The characterisation of constraint weighting performance. Based on our empirical study we identiIS' the weighting behaviours and problem features that favour constrtt weighting. We conclude weighting does better on structured problems where the algorithm can recognise a harder sub-group of constraints. 5. The extension of constraint weighting. We introduce an efficient arc weighting algorithm that additionally weights connections between constraints that are simultaneously violated at a local minimum. This algorithm is empirically shown to outperform standard constraint weighting on a range of CSPs and within a general constraint solving system. Also we look at combining constraint weighting with other local search heuristics and find that these hybrid techniques can do well on problems where the parent algorithms are evenly matched. 6. The application of constraint weighting to over constrained domains. Our empirical work suggests constraint weighting does well for problems with distinctions between constraint groups. This led us to investigate solving real-world over constrained problems with hard and soft constraint groups and to introduce two dynamic constraint weighting heuristics that maintain a distinction between hard and soft constraint groups while still adding weights to violated constraints in a local minimum. In an empirical study, the dynamic schemes are shown to outperform other fixed weighting and non-weighting systems on a range of real world problems. In addition, the performance of weighting is shown to degrade less severely when soft constraints are added to the system, suggesting constraint weighting is especially applicable to realistic, hard and soft constraint problems</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Constraint satisfaction</field><field name="subject">local search taxonomy</field><field name="subject">CSP modelling framework</field><field name="subject">constraint weighting</field><field name="subject">constraint programming</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050901.142439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Italo-Australian Press: Media and Mass Communication in the Emigration World 1900-1940</field><field name="creator">Tosco, Amedeo</field><field name="description">L'idea di questa tesi nasce da una serie di circostanze, prima tra tutte la professione dell'autore che per quindici anni ha svolto in Italia l'attivit&#224; di giornalista, lavorando prima al Messaggero di Roma, come cronista, e successivamente alla Rai - Radiotelevisione Italiana in qualit&#224; di redattore di 'giudiziaria' .  Inoltre, l'autore di questa tesi, ha fatto una interessantissima esperienza professionale  sia come critico cinematografico e sia come 'pastonista politico'  presso la redazione romana del Giornale Nuovo - coordinata in quegli anni da Cesare Zappulli - quando era direttore il grande e indimenticabile Indro Montanelli, prima cio&#232; che quell'arruffapopoli di Berlusconi affondasse completamente il giornale, trasformandolo nel bollettino parrocchiale di quel guazzabuglio politico che &#232; 'Forza  Italia' Questo non &#232; il nostro primo cimento nel campo della storia del giornalismo in quanto segue una tesi di Master, conseguita al dipartimento di Storia dell'University of Queensland e che ha avuto come relatore il  Dr. Don Dignan, dal titolo 'Press and Consensus in Fascist Italy'. In questa prima tesi &#232; stata affrontata la fascistizzazione della stampa italiana tra il 1922 ed il 1940 e il modo in cui Mussolini, che cap&#236; esattamente l'importanza dei media e del controllo dell'informazione, cre&#242; quella corrente di consenso che permise al fascismo di governare indisturbato per tutto il 'ventennio'. In quella tesi di Master &#232; stato anche affrontato e studiato il modo in cui i giornalisti (gli sceneggiatori del regime) ed i giornali, sia essi 'indipendenti' e di partito, manipolarono le notizie per darle in pasto ai propri lettori, con tutte quelle interpolazioni, ridondanze ed ombre che identificano il modo tuttora esistenze di concepire e fare  un giornale. Nella nostra tesi di Ph.D. seguiremo  una traccia similare, cercando di vedere e di analizzare se anche la stampa etnica ha usato, direttamente o indirettamente, forme di manipolazioni, di interferenze o di ridondanze nel creare e porgere le notizie al lettore italo-australiano. Inoltre &#232; nostro intento accertare fino a che punto questa stampa ha creato un consenso verso particolari scelte politiche, sociali e di costume e se questo consenso &#232; stato accettato dai lettori etnici, e in che misura. In altre parole il quesito che in linea di massima ci poniamo &#232; identificare  che influenza ha avuto la stampa etnica sulla comunit&#224; italiana.  I problemi che questo tipo di ricerca implica sono stati numerosi, soprattutto dovuti al fatto che non esiste una letteratura specifica e non vi sono studi, nel campo del giornalismo italo-australiano, dei primi quaranta anni del novecento. Inoltre la maggior parte dei giornali pubblicati in quegli anni sono andati distrutti. Si &#232; cercato inoltre di delineare una immagine dei problemi e delle aspirazioni della comunit&#224; italo-australiana attraverso l'analisi della stampa etnica, visto che la maggior parte degli autori hanno affrontato, fino ad oggi,  questo tema usando documenti ufficiali o racconti e testimonianze di persone vissute nel periodo analizzato dalla nostra tesi. Abbiamo cercato, quindi, di dare una nuova luce e, quando &#232; stato possibile, di dare la giusta dimensione agli avvenimenti accaduti dato che quanto veniva pubblicato sulle colonne dei giornali era scritto a 'caldo', senza  influenze  burocratiche e senza il filtro del tempo e delle memorie che spesso distorcono la realt&#224; creando affabulazioni lontane dalla realt&#224;.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Italo-Australian press</field><field name="subject">media in Australia</field><field name="subject">mass communication</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070215.111854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teams, Control, Cooperation and Resistance in New Workplaces</field><field name="creator">Townsend, Keith</field><field name="description">&lt;P&gt;The study of work teams has captured the attention of academics and practitioners throughout the latter stages of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century. There has been much debate and one could be forgiven for thinking that we 'know' the answers. However, there are still substantial gaps in our knowledge of the practical operations of work teams.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The are many complications involved in the study of work teams, including the lack of suitable and consistently used definitions and the failure amongst researchers to distinguish between the nature of different forms of teamworking. Furthermore, the labelling of formal work groups is rather ambiguous, even clich&#233;d. Academics and practitioners hold different perceptions about what makes a team and much of the literature reflects production processes within manufacturing organisations. With the growing size of the service economy further research must be undertaken to understand teams within this context.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the basis of these difficulties, one may expect that it is impossible to compare teams that exist in different organisations, different product markets, different labour markets and indeed, different sectors of the economy. However, reflecting upon earlier industrial sociology that compares diverse industries this thesis makes such a comparison. A Government-owned call centre and a food-processing organisation are compared throughout this thesis. Both are smaller worksites of larger organisations. The intent of this thesis is to examine such diverse teams to consider how teams influence factors such as control, cooperation and resistance within organisations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This thesis was developed to consider all employee actions in the workplace. This includes actions that would be viewed by management as positive and actions that would be considered by management as deviant or negative. Hence, a research methodology was required that was able to investigate actions that occur below the surface of formal and consensual rules and uncover any covert actions that were present in the workplace. To investigate such actions it was essential for the researcher to develop relationships with the research subjects that allowed a free exchange of information. Consequently, an ethnographic case study method was determined to be the most appropriate form of data collection. With the majority of fieldwork taking place over a period of eight months, the researcher was able to uncover some interesting actions in each workplace. Hence, a contribution to the literature can be made considering employee acts of resistance in new workplaces that are not changing to, but begin with a team structure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This thesis investigates how work teams influence the level of control, cooperation and resistance within new organisations. It has been found that the work teams have little clear influence on aspects of worker control; this is primarily driven by managerial strategy. Where management maintain a hierarchical decision-making structure (even if it is flatter than the structure could be), then limited control will be devolved to the members of the work teams. The levels of both cooperation and resistance on the other hand are influenced primarily by the amount of off-task time that the team members have. Where employees have a greater level of off-task time, they have the scope and opportunity to engage in higher levels of cooperative acts, as well as higher levels of resistance. Furthermore, this thesis adds support to the notion that teams can exist in organisations without there being a high level of teamworking present. Teams in these organisations are a structure of social organisation and managerial control rather than employee empowerment. The notion of the managerially constructed work team seems to have some longevity and hence, cannot be completely dismissed as a managerial fad.&lt;/P&gt;</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Work teams</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">organizational behavoir</field><field name="subject">teams</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060105.175835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and Problem-Finding in High Schools: a Study of Students and Their Teacher in One Queensland school</field><field name="creator">Tracy, Peter</field><field name="description">The study challenges current literature, which views the notion of problem-finding as the initial identification of a problem to be solved. The concept of problem-finding in this study is that problem-finding continues throughout the problem-solving process and is not distinct from it. This thesis aims to develop a better understanding of problem-finding by examining high school students using problem-finding to solve industrial design problems. The study seeks to find out what types of problem-finding exist and what roles they play in solving design problems. To explore problem-finding, this study uses a Think Aloud methodology to examine the thinking of three high school industrial design students and one high school industrial design teacher solving an authentic industrial design problem. Protocol data was gathered from the subjects and then transcribed, segmented and analysed in three ways, each of which became progressively more specific: Firstly, a macroscopic examination which identified problem-finding episodes occurring throughout the design process; secondly, a microscopic examination which identified four categories of problem-finding; and lastly, a microscopic examination which looked at the role played by the different problem-finding categories in solving design problems. The findings of this study are fourfold. Firstly, problem-finding was found to be used throughout the entire design process. Secondly, there were four categories of problemfinding. Thirdly, each category played an important role predominantly through interaction with other categories. Lastly, the more experienced a person was, the more able they were to use problem-finding effectively to solve design problems. Many current practices use trial and error methods to solve design problems. The importance of this study is that through a better understanding of problem-finding, designers may be able to use metacognitive strategies more efficiently in the process. Similarly, in educational practice, high school design students may be able to learn to think about the methods they use to solve design problems, and this may result in more creative designs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Problem-finding</field><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="subject">design problem solutions</field><field name="subject">educational practice</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051110.154602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of the Chemical Constituents of Two Species of Marine Sponge</field><field name="creator">Tucker, David John</field><field name="description">An investigation of the dichioromethane extract of the sponge, Xestospongia testudinaria indicated that the extract was composed of approximately 40% sterols, 30% saturated fatty acids, 10% mono-unsaturated fatty acids and 20% poly-unsaturated acids. The sterol profile was found to vary between two collections of the sponge. In the first collection the major sterol was the C30 compound, xestosterol (4), which had not previously been reported to occur in this species. In the second collection there was a wider distribution of components with cholesterol (2a) being a major constituent and xestosterol being present in a much lower percentage than in the first collection. The poly-unsaturated acid fraction contained an extremely complex mixture. The novel brominated bisacetylenic C18 (47) and brominated C28 (65) acids were found to be the major components. Another six novel brominated acetylenic acids, which were very unstable, were also identified as well as an ester of 4 with 47. The method developed for the separation of the poly-unsaturated acids from the other classes of metabolites and for the isolation of the pure compounds is discussed and their structural elucidation, largely on the basis of NIMR spectroscopy is described. From the hexane extract of Carteriospongia foliascens, two novel bisalkylated norscalarane derivatives (114 and 116) and a bisalkylated scalarane derivative (130) have been isolated. By use of high field NMR and multipulse NMR techniques a complete assignment of the 111 and 13C NMR spectra of 130 has been achieved on 1.5mg of material. This represents the first report of a complete assignment of the 1J4 NMR spectrum of a scalarane derivative. The C-4 stereochemistry of 130 was determined by use of 1H NMR spectroscopic techniques, which gave results in agreement with the previously used 13C NMR method.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Xestospongia testudinaria</field><field name="subject">brominated bisacetylenic</field><field name="subject">brominated acids</field><field name="subject">NMR spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">marine sponges</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050826.155059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of the Tripartite Model in Three Age Cohorts of Children and Youth</field><field name="creator">Turner, Cynthia Michelle</field><field name="description">A large body of literature exists to show that childhood anxiety and depression are significantly interrelated, both at the disorder and the symptom level. Clark and Watson (1991) proposed that a tripartite model could account for the observed relations between anxiety and depression. The tripartite model holds that while anxiety and depression share a substantial component of general affective distress or negative affectivity (NA), they can be meaningfully differentiated on the basis of specific symptoms. Anhedonia, or low positive affect (PA), is seen as specific to depression, and physiological arousal (PH), or somatic tension, is seen as unique to anxiety. The studies presented in this thesis were designed to investigate the tripartite model of anxiety and depression in children and youth. Although previous studies provide some support for the validity of the tripartite model in children, they have not systematically examined the generalisability of the model across the developmental spectrum. Where age differences have been explored, there is some evidence to suggest that anxiety and depression show greater differentiation across development. Therefore, the first study sought to test unitary, dual, and tripartite models of anxiety and depression in a cross-sectional design, using three distinct age cohorts of non-referred children and youth recruited from grade 3 (mean age 7.74 years), grade 6 (mean age 10.59 years), and grade 9 (mean age 13.52 years). A confirmatory factor analytic strategy was used with selected items from the Revised Children&#146;s Manifest Anxiety Scale and the Children&#146;s Depression Inventory. The study found little evidence to support the idea of increasing differentiation with age. All models provided a moderate fit to the data, although analyses indicated that a correlated three-factor tripartite model was the preferred model in all age cohorts. These results suggest that the tripartite model may be a clinically useful tool in differentiating between depressive and anxious symptoms and disorders in children of all ages. The second study then sought to examine the predictive utility of the tripartite model, using a subsample of participants from the first study. In line with the tripartite theory, it was anticipated that the dimensions of NA and PA would predict concurrent and future symptoms of hopelessness (depression). Further, it was expected that the dimensions of NA and PH would predict concurrent and future symptoms of panic (anxiety). Self-report symptoms of hopelessness and panic were measured at baseline and again 12 months later. Results revealed some consistencies and inconsistencies with respect to the predictions of the model. In accordance with predictions, results indicated that NA and PA were significant predictors of concurrent symptoms of hopelessness for grade 3 and grade 6 students, but not for grade 9 students. In addition, NA and PH were significant predictors of concurrent symptoms of panic for grade 6 students, but not for grade 3 or grade 9 students. The tripartite dimensions of NA and PA predicted future hopelessness symptoms for grade 6 students only, however the NA and PH dimensions did not predict future symptoms of panic for any students. Methodology of the study is examined in interpreting the obtained results, and limitations and directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tripartite model</field><field name="subject">anxiety</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">hopelessness</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030701.122513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generating Solutions to the Jigsaw Puzzle Problem</field><field name="creator">Tybon, Robert</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the problem of the automated re-assembly of jigsaw puzzles. The objectives of this research are as follows: to provide a clear statement of the jigsaw puzzle re-assembly problem; to find out which solution technique is best suited to this problem; to determine the level of sensitivity of the proposed solution technique when solving different variations of this problem; and to explore solution methods for solving incomplete jigsaw puzzles (puzzles with missing pieces). The jigsaw puzzle re-assembly problem has been investigated only intermittently in the research literature. This work presents an extensive examination of the suitability and efficiency of the standard solution techniques that can be applied to this problem. A detailed comparison between different solution methods including Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search and Constraint Satisfaction Programming, shows that a constraint-based approach is the most efficient method of generating solutions to the jigsaw puzzle problem. The proposed re-assembly algorithm is successful. Consequently, it can be used in development of automated solution generators for other problems in the same domain, thus creating new theoretical and applied directions in this field of research. One potential theoretical line of research concerns jigsaw puzzles that do not have a complete set of puzzle pieces. These incomplete puzzles represent a difficult aspect of this problem that is outlined but can not be resolved in the current research. The computational experiments conducted in this thesis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm being optimised to re-assemble the jigsaw puzzles is not efficient when applied to the puzzles with missing pieces. Further work was undertaken to modify the proposed algorithm to enable efficient re-assembly of incomplete jigsaw puzzles. Consequently, an original heuristic strategy, termed Empty Slot Prediction, was developed to support the proposed algorithm, and proved successful when applied to certain sub-classes of this problem. The results obtained indicate that no one algorithm can be used to solve the multitude of possible scenarios involved in the re-assembly of incomplete jigsaw puzzles. Other variations of the jigsaw puzzle problem that still remain unsolved are presented as avenues for future research. The solution of this problem involves a number of procedures with significant applications in other computer-related areas such as pattern recognition, feature and shape description, boundary-matching, and heuristic modelling. It also has more practical applications in robotic vision and reconstruction of broken artefacts in archaeology.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">jigsaw puzzle</field><field name="subject">jigsaw puzzles</field><field name="subject">reassembly</field><field name="subject">re-assembly</field><field name="subject">problem</field><field name="subject">automated</field><field name="subject">automation</field><field name="subject">Genetic Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Simulated Annealing</field><field name="subject">Tabu Search</field><field name="subject">Constraint Satisfaction Programming</field><field name="subject">heuristic programming</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041101.085937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Seawater Desalination With Waste Incineration Energy Using Dynamic Systems Approach</field><field name="creator">Udono, Ken</field><field name="description">Water shortage issues have been growing concerns in many cities around the world in recent years, especially in Eastern cities of Australia, which is the driest continent on the earth. The aim of this PhD thesis is a development of a model to study the use of waste incineration energy supplemented by alternative energy to power seawater desalination. It is to aid the freshwater supply of a drought stricken city in Eastern Australia. My work contributes to a development of efficient model in a simpler understandable way to reduce efforts required for modelling complex multi domain problems. This research is motivated by the successive severe drought conditions that affected many Australian cities in the past few years, compounded with an additional strain from a fast growing population. While we dump our waste into the Australian landscape, in more densely populated cities in Europe and Asia, the waste is incinerated to obtain thermal energy for various purposes. The waste is used as an energy source while at the same time reducing the amount of space needed for landfill. Seawater desalination has been uccessfully practiced for quite some time particularly in the Middle Eastern countries. To deal with increasing water shortage crisis, many cities around the world have opted or are considering seawater desalination to supplement their freshwater supply. The combination of both - waste incineration and seawater desalination - has rarely been studied. This is a twofold problem that requires modelling the problem of water demand and supply together with waste incineration to find a sustainable solution. This is a complex task. The effort needed for this can be reduced by using a modelling approach that is more efficient than the traditionally used statistical approaches. In this thesis, I present a comprehensive model developed using a dynamic system approach combined with artificial neural networks. It simulates water demand and supply as well as the possible amount of the desalinated water that can be produced using the energy from clean city waste incineration. This is done while taking in various influential factors including population growth and irregular weather patterns. This research comprises a literature review on seawater desalination and waste incineration, the establishment of water demand and supply dynamics of Gold Coast City as my case study and identifying any modelling difficulties that need to be overcome. This is followed by the development of a comprehensive model and its components, model calibration and simulation experiments. It was found that with the energy of waste incineration, up to 60% of the freshwater demand could be fulfilled by seawater desalination in a sustainable way.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water shortage (Australia</field><field name="subject">Eastern Cities)</field><field name="subject">severe drought conditions</field><field name="subject">fast growing population</field><field name="subject">seawater desalination</field><field name="subject">water demand and supply</field><field name="subject">dynamic systems approach</field><field name="subject">waste incineration energy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070110.164750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community Participation in Australian Community Broadcasting: A Comparative Study of Rural, Regional and Remote Radio</field><field name="creator">van Vuuren, Catharina Cornelia Maria (Kitty)</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationship between media and democracy with a particular focus on Australian community broadcasting.  I put forward the thesis that the value and purpose of community broadcasting are located in its community development function, rather than in its ability to transmit alternative information.  This suggests that an analysis should emphasise community rather than media.  Community development promotes the empowerment of ordinary people so that they can confidently participate in management and decision-making - that is, the procedures and norms that underpin democratic practices.  In the case of community media, the relationship between democracy and media is located primarily in its volunteers. To understand this relationship, I link together concepts of the public sphere and social capital.  The public sphere is understood as multiple and diverse and linked to other publics via the web of relationships forged among people with shared interests and norms.  I argue that a community public sphere should be understood as a cultural resource and managed as a common property.  The public sphere is thus conceived to have a more or less porous boundary that serves to regulate membership.  Understood as a bounded domain, the public sphere can be analysed in terms of its ideological structure, its management practices and its alliances with other publics.  This approach also allows for a comparison with other similar public spheres. The study identifies two main ideological constellations that have shaped the development of Australian community broadcasting - professionalism and community development, with the former gaining prominence as the sector expands into rural and regional communities.  The ascendancy of professional and quasi-commercial practices is of concern as it can undermine the community development potential of community broadcasting, a function that appears to be little understood and one which has attracted little research. The study presents a case study of three regional and remote rural community radio stations and compares them from a social capital perspective.  Social capital is a framework for understanding the relationship between the individual and the community and explores this relationship in terms of participation in networks, reciprocal benefits among groups and individuals and the nature of active participation. Demographic and organisational structures of the three stations are also compared.  By taking this approach, each station's capacity for community development and empowerment is addressed. The results of the fieldwork reveal that the success of a community radio station is related to 'community spirit' and demographic structure.  They reveal that the community radio station in the smallest community with the lowest per capita income was best able to meet the needs of its community and its volunteers.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">community radio</field><field name="subject">community broadcasting</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">regional</field><field name="subject">remote</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="subject">democracy</field><field name="subject">democratic</field><field name="subject">mass media</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">volunteer</field><field name="subject">volunteers</field><field name="subject">voluntary</field><field name="subject">voluntarism</field><field name="subject">news</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040720.153812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Placental Oxidative Stress in Preeclampsia</field><field name="creator">Vanderlelie, Jessica</field><field name="description">Affecting 6-8% of all pregnancies, preeclampsia is the leading cause of maternal morbidity in the western world and is charactensed by hypertension, proteinuria, edema and platelet aggregation. Despite its prevalence and severity, no comprehensive theory or single factor has been suggested to explain the pathophysiology of this multi system disorder of pregnancy, with the only therapies being bed rest, pharmacological symptom management and if necessary early delivery. Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, resulting from defective trophoblast invasion, reductions in placental perfusion and placental hypoxia/reoxygenation. The inability of endogenous antioxidant systems up regulated in normal pregnancy, to control increased levels of oxidative stress, is suggested as a possible factor in the feed forward generation of reactive oxygen species and placental oxidative stress. That in turn may stimulate increased syncytiotrophoblast apoptosis, endothelial cell activation and the maternal hyper immune response characteristic of preeclampsia. Analysis of the research literature revealed that previous evaluations of placental oxidation and antioxidant enzyme activity in preeclampsia were by no means comprehensive, and exhibited significant inter-study variations. It was the aim of this thesis to clarify the placental oxidative state and the endogenous antioxidant activity of glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, thioredoxin and superoxide dismutase in human placentae in an attempt to determine if variations in antioxidant function were due to changes in gene expression or protein oxidation. The findings reported in this thesis indicate the presence of increased levels of oxidative stress in the preeclamptic placenta, associated with significant reductions in antioxidant enzyme capacity. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of placental samples revealed that deceases in antioxidant capacity in the placenta are more likely to be related to the significant oxidative burden within the tissue rather than reductions in gene expression. A number of animal models exist to investigate components of preeclampsia pathophysiology, however the ability of these models to mimic the oxidative and antioxidant features of preeclampsia remains unclear. The exposure of pregnant rats to N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester is a widely used model of endothelial cell dysfunction during preeclampsia. It was the aim of this thesis to determine the biochemical characteristics of this model in an attempt to assess its effectiveness in mimicking oxidative changes in the preeclamptic placenta. Although this model is capable of producing a syndiome in rats similar to the disorder in terms of physiology, this is not manifest in terms of placental biochemistry. The importance of selenium in the synthesis of selenobased antioxidants such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase is well documented. Increasing demand for selenium by the developing fetus may be linked to reductions in selenium status during pregnancy. Considering preeclampsia is associated with significant reductions in selenium status it may be hypothesised that reductions in antioxidant function may be linked to selenium inadequacy. The modulation of dietary selenium in pregnant rats was used to determine the importance of selenium during pregnancy and its effect on antioxidant function and placental oxidative stress. The results of this analysis revealed that selenium deficiency causes a pregnancy specific condition similar to preeclampsia. This condition was found to be associated with increased placental oxidative stress and significant reductions in the systemic activity of selenobased antioxidants that could be modified through selenium supplementation. In summary, data obtained in this thesis indicate that placental oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant enzyme activity play a significant role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. These studies support the hypothesis that antioxidant sufficiency is crucial in the maintenance of oxidative balance and that antioxidant dysfunction may result in damage to the placenta and the progression of the disease. These novel data further our understanding of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and provide new insight into the pathogenesis of clinical complications exhibited in this condition, suggesting antioxidant therapy as a possible means for improving the health outcomes of both mother and baby.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Preeclampsia</field><field name="subject">placental oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">maternal morbidity</field><field name="subject">defective trophoblast invasion</field><field name="subject">placental perfusion</field><field name="subject">placental hypoxia/reoxygenation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060918.161726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying Genes Influencing Bone Mineral Density</field><field name="creator">Vaughan, Tanya</field><field name="description">Bone mineral density (BMD) is a reflection of the action of osteoblasts compared to osteoclasts.  An imbalance in the activity of osteoblasts or osteoclasts, results in bone disease such as osteoporosis caused by overactive osteoclasts.  BMD is influenced by genetic and environmental factors as demonstrated through twin studies, association studies and linkage analysis (Ralston, 1999).  Several polymorphisms involved in the determination of BMD have been identified, with Vitamin D receptor and Collagen Type 1 showing reproducible associations.  To identify genes influencing BMD two distinct strategies have been employed: 1) To determine if DNA polymorphism within the runt related transcription factor (RUNX2) gene is a determinant of BMD and fracture in women. 2) The identification of RANKL target genes in osteoclastogenesis.   RUNX2 is a runt domain transcription factor (Werner et al., 1999) essential for osteoblast differentiation (Lee et al., 1997).  RUNX2 gene knock-out mice have no osteoblasts due to a failure in osteoblast differentiation and consequently unmineralised skeletons, (Komori et al., 1997; Otto et al., 1997).  In humans, mutations in RUNX2 cause cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), a disorder characterised by hypoplasia or aplasia of the clavicles, short stature, supernumerary teeth, patent fontanelles and other changes in skeletal patterning and growth (Mundlos et al., 1997).  RUNX2 contains a poly-glutamine poly-alanine (polyQ/polyA) repeat where mutations causing cleidocranial dysplasia have been observed.  BMD has not been routinely examined in CCD, two studies have identified CCD patients with lower BMD with one fracture case identified (Quack et al., 1999; Bergwitz et al., 2001).  The central role of RUNX2 in determining osteoblast differentiation makes RUNX2 a prime candidate gene for regulating adult bone density. To determine if polymorphism was present in the polyQ/polyA tract the repeat was amplified within the upper and lower deciles of femoral neck (FN) BMD in the Geelong Osteoporosis study (GOS).  The upper and lower deciles of FN BMD acted as a surrogate for genotyping the entire cohort.  This study identified two common variants within the polyA repeat: an 18 base pair deletion (11Ala) and a synonymous alanine codon polymorphism with alleles, GCA and GCG (noted as A and G alleles, respectively).  The 11Ala and SNP polymorphism are found on codon 64 and 66 respectively (RUNX2 MRIPV variant).  A allele frequencies were significantly different in a comparison of the upper and lower deciles of FN BMD (p=0.019).  In 495 randomly selected women of the Geelong Osteoporosis Study (GOS), the A allele was associated with higher BMD at all sites tested.  The association was maximal at the ultra-distal radius (p=0.001).  In a separate fracture study, the A allele was significantly protective against Colles' fracture in elderly women but not spine and hip fracture. The 11Ala polymorphism was not related to BMD in GOS. To further decipher the role of the RUNX2 A allele we genotyped 992 women from a Scottish cohort.  The alleles of RUNX2 within the glutamine/alanine repeat were determined by MspA1I restriction digest.  To examine the possible influence on estrogen related therapies or estrogen status on the potential genetic effect conferred by RUNX2, we divided the cohort by menopausal and hormone replacement therapy status.  Within postmenopausal Scottish women the RUNX2 A allele was associated with significantly higher FN BMD (p=0.028, n=312) but not lumbar spine (LS) BMD.  The A allele was associated with higher FN BMD (p=0.035) within a postmenopausal subgroup of the population (n=312).  To investigate the effect of weight on the RUNX2 alleles the Scottish cohort was segregated into thin/normal (BMI &#8805; 25 kg/m2) and overweight /obese (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2).  RUNX2 A allele showed a stronger effect on FN BMD in postmenopausal women above the median BMI.  The 11Ala RUNX2 deletion allele was significantly associated with decreased LS BMD (p=0.018) within overweight/obese women (n=546).  The 11Ala allele was significantly associated with increased levels of pyridinoline (p=0.014) and deoxypyridinoline (p=0.038) in the HRT treated subgroup of the population (n=492).  Glutamine variants and an alanine insertion were identified within the group.  These data suggest that the RUNX2 11Ala and A alleles exert differing affects on BMD showing preference for different skeletal sites in a weight dependent manner. We genotyped 78 individuals from an osteoarthritic population to elucidate the role of the RUNX2 alleles on markers of bone turnover and inflammation.  The RUNX2 11Ala allele was significantly associated with decreased osteocalcin (OC) serum levels (p = 0.01).  The RUNX2 A allele was significantly related to reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) serum levels (p = 0.004).  RUNX2 is known to bind to the OC promoter.  An OC promoter polymorphism is found 7bp upstream from a putative RUNX2 binding site.  We hypothesized that OC polymorphism may effect the RUNX2 transactivation of the OC gene and thus affect OC serum levels.  OC promoter polymorphism was not related to OC serum levels (n=78).  These data present a novel link between RUNX2 alleles and OC and TNF serum levels, providing putative mechanisms of action for the RUNX2 alleles.  Further studies in larger populations are required to confirm these findings. Ten individuals within the GOS and the Scottish cohort were found to carry rare mutations of the polyQ/polyA repeat.  All polyQ variants had a normal polyA repeat (17 amino acids) and were heterozygous for a normal 23Q/17A allele.  Variants observed were 15, 16, 24 and 30Q.  One individual was observed with an extended polyA repeat (24A).  Patient records indicated otherwise unremarkable clinical history except for fracture in 4/10 individuals from GOS (hip and spine).  BMD data from the LS and the FN were expressed as T-scores, a measure that relates BMD in terms of standard deviations below the young normal value.  In addition, BMD data were also expressed as Z-scores around the age-mean.  Under the null hypothesis, where RUNX2 Q repeat variation has no effect on BMD, Z scores would be expected to be distributed around a mean of zero.  However, when all variants were pooled the BMD was significantly lower than expected.  This effect persisted when deletion variants were considered alone.  The effect was stronger on FN BMD (p=0.001) rather than LS BMD (p=0.096), reflecting either difference in precision of BMD measurements at these sites or perhaps a differential genetic effect on different skeletal sites.  These data suggest that polyQ and polyA variants are associated with significantly lower BMD, and may be an important determinant for fracture.  Glutamine variants exist at high frequency (~0.7%): this rate of mutation could be important when considering large populations at risk of age related osteoporosis.  Considering that these subjects are heterozygous for a normal allele, it suggests that a more severe phenotype might be expected in rare subjects homozygous for glutamine repeat variants. In summary, this study investigated the role of novel polymorphisms and rare variants of the RUNX2 gene in influencing BMD, fracture and markers of bone turnover.  Two common polymorphisms were identified within the polyA repeat: an 18 base pair deletion and a synonymous alanine codon polymorphism with alleles, A and G.  The A allele was associated with increased BMD and was protective against a common form of osteoporotic fracture within a Geelong population.  To verify these findings the RUNX2 alleles were genotyped in 992 women from a Scottish cohort.  The magnitude and the direction of the effect of the A allele was maintained in the Scottish cohort.  Interestingly, the A allele was shown to exert a menopause specific effect, with postmenopausal women showing the strongest effect.  On re-analysis of the GOS data the post-menopausal women were found to drive the significance identified in the cohort.  The magnitude of the effect of the A allele on BMD was greater in overweight/obese postmenopausal women indicating a gene-weight interaction for RUNX2.  The RUNX2 11Ala allele showed a significant relationship with decreased LS BMD in overweight/obese Scottish women.  The 11Ala allele was also associated with higher levels of urinary PYD and DPD in women treated with HRT, indicating higher levels of bone turnover in carriers of the 11Ala allele.  In contrast to the Scottish cohort, no significant association with heterozygous carriers of 11Ala was observed in GOS, although a significant association was detected for homozygous carriers and LS BMAD.  The 11 Ala RUNX2 allele was significantly associated with decreased serum osteocalcin levels and the A allele was significantly associated with TNF in OA patients.  Glutamine variants and an alanine insertion were identified within Geelong and Scottish cohorts, which showed low Z and T scores suggesting that RUNX2 variants may be related to genetic effects on BMD and osteoporosis.  Polymorphism of the polyQ/polyA region of RUNX2 were identified within this study were shown to associate with significant differences in BMD.  The A allele showed a significant association with increased BMD in postmenopausal women from a Geelong and Scottish cohort, with a decreased frequency of the A allele observed in Colles' fracture patients from Geelong.  The 11Ala deletion allele was significantly associated with decreased LS BMD and increases in markers of bone turnover in the Scottish cohort.  A significant decrease in OC serum levels was observed in OA patients suggesting a direct effect of the allele on the transactivation of the RUNX2 gene.  Rare variants of RUNX2 were identified which showed low BMD.  These studies have provided insight into the role of RUNX2 in influencing BMD, further studies are required to verify the role of the A allele on BMD and fracture, the role of the rare variants and to identify the precise mechanisms behind the observed changes in BMD. - 2) The identification of RANKL target genes in osteoclastogenesis. Osteoclastogenesis is regulated in vivo by the action of osteoblast/stromal cells that express membrane bound, receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL).  Monocytes treated in vitro with a soluble form of RANKL and macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) differentiate to osteoclasts, whereas monocytes treated with M-CSF alone differentiate to macrophage-like cells.  The gene expression profile of human osteoclasts has not been extensively explored.  Genes highly expressed by rabbit osteoclasts were identified through random sequencing of an osteoclast cDNA library (Sakai et al., 1995).  Differential gene expression of mouse osteoclastogenesis was elucidated by array analysis (Cappellen et al., 2002).  To identify genes important for human osteoclastogenesis, total RNA was isolated from monocytes treated for three weeks with either M-CSF alone or with RANKL and M-CSF.  RANKL treatment for 3 weeks and 12 hours was investigated in this study, to complement previous data.  Differential display was performed on RNA (12 hour treatment with RANKL) and differential gene expression profiles examined.  The differential display products were pooled to generate a probe for screening a gene array system derived from a human osteoclast cDNA library. cDNA (3 week treatment with RANKL) hybridisation experiments against the array revealed additional regulated genes.  Gene clones that showed significant regulation in M-CSF and RANKL treated cells compared M-CSF treated cells represent genes that are targets for RANKL-specific regulation.  Osteopontin, creatine kinase and various mitochondrial genes were up regulated by the treatment of RANKL.  Changes in gene expression observed in the array data were confirmed with real-time PCR using mRNA derived from in vitro induced osteoclasts.  Cathepsin K gene expression was more than 300 fold greater in osteoclasts compared to macrophage-like cells after one week treatment with RANKL and M-CSF.  Cystatin C expression showed a six-fold induction at two weeks of RANKL and M-CSF treatment and cystatin B showed a steady increase in expression.

The text is a thread in the web, as are elements of context, yet the threads are in a symbiotic and constantly changing relationship with each other, as the web is constantly in a state of renewal and change. At the same time, the text itself is a web, as are the various contexts. The threads are both ephemeral and fleeting, while incredibly strong. This thesis is about the polysemy of science fiction film: its subject is the films of the fifties that belong to the genre of science fiction. But the area of study began as an investigation of the science in science fiction films; the way in which films construct that science, the end result of that construction and the totality of the discourse of science in relation to other discourses of power and influence. The investigation of those issues involves a multi-layered investigation into science fiction, in a similar way to Tulloch and Alvarado's approach to the Dr Who television series.1 Approaching science fiction films from a perspective of genre, as in chapter one, uncovers a set of arguments about the science in science fiction, as well as establishing the global nature of some science fiction. These concerns lead into the discussion in chapter two of the social and historical context of the fifties, specifically in the US. Science plays a major role in these contexts, in the sense of the importance of science in creating these contexts (from this perspective) as well as the effects of the application of this science. But the historical and cultural contexts tend to suggest that science fiction films are in large part both a response to the social and historical context, and also create that context. This would not be quite accurate: the production of many science fiction films mobilise other arguments, arguments relating to the industry of Hollywood, and the specific industrial context that gave rise to some very financially successful science fiction films, as well as some films where the budget was good for a few days filming. Science and technology are sometimes important elements in this industrial context as well. Part II traces the nature of science in these films, using the contexts in Part I to anchor the science and its implications and effects. Foregrounded is the debate in which science is both key player and, in many cases, antagonist. The debate is traced and the various representations of science and its nature are tracked and highlighted. Science can cause change, by virtue of its nature of uncovering superstition, but the worth or desirability of that change is open to question. The control of science is a related issue. The thesis examines science at a period that saw the efflorescence of science fiction films. The examination of those films tells us a great deal about the concerns of the time, as well as the science that figures so powerfully in the webs of culture of the fifties.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Science fiction films</field><field name="subject">1950's science fiction</field><field name="subject">Dr Who television series</field><field name="subject">science and technology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051012.112131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquisition of Fuzzy Measures in Multicriteria Decision Making Using Similarity-based Reasoning</field><field name="creator">Wagholikar, Amol S</field><field name="description">Continuous development has been occurring in the area of decision support systems. Modern systems focus on applying decision models that can provide intelligent support to the decision maker. These systems focus on modelling the human reasoning process in situations requiring decision. This task may be achieved by using an appropriate decision model. Multicriteria decision making (MCDM) is a common decision making approach. This research investigates and seeks a way to resolve various issues associated with the application of this model. MCDM is a formal and systematic decision making approach that evaluates a given set of alternatives against a given set of criteria. The global evaluation of alternatives is determined through the process of aggregation. It is well established that the aggregation process should consider the importance of criteria while determining the overall worth of an alternative. The importance of individual criteria and of sub-sets of the criteria affects the global evaluation. The aggregation also needs to consider the importance of the sub-set of criteria. Most decision problems involve dependent criteria and the interaction between the criteria needs to be modelled. Traditional aggregation approaches, such as weighted average, do not model the interaction between the criteria. Non-additive measures such as fuzzy measures model the interaction between the criteria. However, determination of non-additive measures in a practical application is problematic. Various approaches have been proposed to resolve the difficulty in acquisition of fuzzy measures. These approaches mainly propose use of past precedents. This research extends this notion and proposes an approach based on similarity-based reasoning. Solutions to the past problems can be used to solve the new decision problems. This is the central idea behind the proposed methodology. The methodology itself applies the theory of reasoning by analogy for solving MCDM problems.  This methodology uses a repository of cases of past decision problems. This case base is used to determine the fuzzy measures for the new decision problem. This work also analyses various similarity measures. The illustration of the proposed methodology in a case-based decision support system shows that interactive models are suitable tools for determining fuzzy measures in a given decision problem. This research makes an important contribution by proposing a similarity-based approach for acquisition of fuzzy measures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Similarity-based Reasoning</field><field name="subject">Fuzzy Measures</field><field name="subject">Multicriteria Decision Making</field><field name="subject">MCDM</field><field name="subject">decision support systems</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071214.152324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Macrolide Antibiotics in Chronic Rhinosinusitis</field><field name="creator">Wallwork, Benjamin</field><field name="description">Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common disorder of chronic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. It is associated with significant symptoms and impairment of the quality of life of sufferers. Despite recent advances in the medical and surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis, there remains a population of patients who fail to obtain relief from their symptoms. Chronic inflammation of the mucosa of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses is one of the hallmarks of chronic rhinosinusitis. This inflammation is demonstrated by an increased number of chronic inflammatory cells, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased expression of adhesion molecules and metaplastic changes in the epithelium. The current medical treatments for chronic sinusitis aim to reduce this inflammation and consequently improve symptoms. In recent years, evidence has emerged that macrolide antibiotics have an anti-inflammatory effect that is separate from their anti-bacterial effect. This effect was first described in the treatment of diffuse panbronchiolitis, a disorder of chronic inflammation of the lower respiratory tract. Following the success of macrolides in treating this condition it was trialed in chronic rhinosinusitis. Several open-label trials have subsequently demonstrated a beneficial effect. Laboratory studies have investigated the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of macrolides. These have shown that macrolides effect cytokine production, inflammatory cell apoptosis, expression of adhesion molecules, neutrophil oxidative burst, bacterial virulence and mucociliary function. In this thesis we report a series of experiments designed to further investigate the mechanism of action and clinical effect of macrolides. In vitro studies using whole sections of chronic rhinosinusitis mucosa cultured for 24 hours in macrolide, prednisolone or control showed that macrolide and prednisolone produced significant reductions in the production of interleukin-5, interleukin-8 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. The same cultured specimens also showed a reduction in expression of transforming growth factor-?. No reduction was seen in the expression of the key pro-inflammatory nuclear transcription factor Nuclear factor-?B. In our in vivo experiments, biopsies were taken from chronic rhinosinusitis patients who had received a 3-month course of macrolide. These biopsies showed a reduction in the number of neutrophils present following treatment. There was no reduction in the number of other inflammatory cells or in the expression of TGF-? and NK-?B. We have performed the first ever double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of macrolide in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. Patients receiving macrolide showed significant improvements in saccharine transit time, nasal endoscopic scoring and symptom scores following a 12 week course. Patients with low levels of serum immunoglobulin E showed significantly improved outcomes compared to those with high levels. Interleukin-8 levels in nasal lavage fluid were significantly reduced in the patients with low levels of IgE following macrolide treatment. No improvements in any of the objective or subjective outcome measures were seen in the placebo-treated patients. We have performed a series of experiments investigating the anti-inflammatory effect of macrolide antibiotics from 'the bench to the bedside'. These experiments have provided insight into the mechanism of action of macrolides in the laboratory setting and evidence of a beneficial effect in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis patients.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhinosinusitis</field><field name="subject">upper respiratory tract</field><field name="subject">paranasal sinuses</field><field name="subject">macrolide antbiotics</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070201.160023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Relationships Between Educational Activities and the Well-Being and Life Satisfaction of Members of Chinese Community Groups</field><field name="creator">Wang, Wan-Sheng</field><field name="description">Most immigrants have to adjust their lives to living in a new country, especially when moving from an Eastern to a Western society. Chinese immigrants may face multiple difficulties, including cultural differences and the English language barrier, which are a particularly problem for older immigrants. To overcome these difficulties, many Chinese immigrants either form new community groups or join those currently operating. Normally, Chinese community groups provide a wide range of activities for members. The literature (e.g., Diener, 1984; Cantor &amp; Sanderson, 1999; Csikszentmihalyi, 1975) provides some understanding of the value for new immigrants in attending these group activities. Participating members report improved life satisfaction within new society and have a more positive outcome as a result of their involvement. However, the magnitude of the influence life satisfaction and well-being is not as clear. This research aimed to better understand the relationships between participation in community group activities and the life satisfaction and well-being of participating members. A quantitative research method was adopted for this study to investigate the relationships between the variables. The study utilised a questionnaire that focused on specific demographic characteristics of participants, a 5-item life satisfaction measure (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &amp; Griffin, 1985), a short 18-item measure (Ryff, 1989a) of the six dimensions of psychological well-being, and on other factors likely to impinge on life satisfaction and well-being. The 7-point agreement scale asked participants the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with the statements. The questionnaire was offered to participants in both English and Chinese. Questionnaires were completed by 600 Chinese-speaking immigrants from Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore who were participants in educational activities and/or other activities offered through 21 different Chinese community groups in Brisbane. Four hundred took part in 20 different educational group activities, and 200 in 25 different non-educational group activities. Most participants were female, and approximately two thirds were over 50 years of age. Using AMOS, a number of structural equations models (SEMs) were tested to investigate the conceptually proposed links between the various variables. This study supports other literature, finding that both educational and general activities provided by the community groups positively influence the participating members' life satisfaction and feelings of well-being. The majority of participants in this study reported that they considered participating in community group educational activities (74.2% agreed), and general activities (66.6%), had the most impact on their life satisfaction and well-being. Most participants (70%) found that community group activities, both educational and general, were interesting. However, only around 53% of them claimed to have achieved their goals in these activities. The findings of this study indicate the complexity of the influences on life satisfaction and well-being levels facing this cohort of Chinese immigrants. Although results suggest that demographic variables such as year of migration and employment status have a greater influence on life satisfaction and well-being than educational activities and general activities, the outcomes of this study support the conclusion that the participating members have benefited from the variety of programs offered by Chinese community groups.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese immigrants (Brisbane</field><field name="subject">Australia)</field><field name="subject">Chinese immigrant quality of life</field><field name="subject">Chinese immigrant community activities</field><field name="subject">Chinese speaking immigrants (Brisbane</field><field name="subject">Australia)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070104.153050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feature Extraction and Dimensionality Reduction in Pattern Recognition and Their Application in Speech Recognition</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xuechuan</field><field name="description">Conventional pattern recognition systems have two components: feature analysis and pattern classification. Feature analysis is achieved in two steps: parameter extraction step and feature extraction step. In the parameter extraction step, information relevant for pattern classification is extracted from the input data in the form of parameter vector. In the feature extraction step, the parameter vector is transformed to a feature vector. Feature extraction can be conducted independently or jointly with either parameter extraction or classification. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are the two popular independent feature extraction algorithms. Both of them extract features by projecting the parameter vectors into a new feature space through a linear transformation matrix. But they optimize the transformation matrix with different intentions. PCA optimizes the transformation matrix by finding the largest variations in the original feature space. LDA pursues the largest ratio of between-class variation and within-class variation when projecting the original feature space to a subspace. The drawback of independent feature extraction algorithms is that their optimization criteria are different from the classifier&#146;s minimum classification error criterion, which may cause inconsistency between feature extraction and the classification stages of a pattern recognizer and consequently, degrade the performance of classifiers. A direct way to overcome this problem is to conduct feature extraction and classification jointly with a consistent criterion. Minimum classification Error (MCE) training algorithm provides such an integrated framework. MCE algorithm was first proposed for optimizing classifiers. It is a type of discriminative learning algorithm but achieves minimum classification error directly. The flexibility of the framework of MCE algorithm makes it convenient to conduct feature extraction and classification jointly. Conventional feature extraction and pattern classification algorithms, LDA, PCA, MCE training algorithm, minimum distance classifier, likelihood classifier and Bayesian classifier, are linear algorithms. The advantage of linear algorithms is their simplicity and ability to reduce feature dimensionalities. However, they have the limitation that the decision boundaries generated are linear and have little computational flexibility. SVM is a recently developed integrated pattern classification algorithm with non-linear formulation. It is based on the idea that the classification that a.ords dot-products can be computed efficiently in higher dimensional feature spaces. The classes which are not linearly separable in the original parametric space can be linearly separated in the higher dimensional feature space. Because of this, SVM has the advantage that it can handle the classes with complex nonlinear decision boundaries. However, SVM is a highly integrated and closed pattern classification system. It is very difficult to adopt feature extraction into SVM&#146;s framework. Thus SVM is unable to conduct feature extraction tasks. This thesis investigates LDA and PCA for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction and proposes the application of MCE training algorithms for joint feature extraction and classification tasks. A generalized MCE (GMCE) training algorithm is proposed to mend the shortcomings of the MCE training algorithms in joint feature and classification tasks. SVM, as a non-linear pattern classification system is also investigated in this thesis. A reduced-dimensional SVM (RDSVM) is proposed to enable SVM to conduct feature extraction and classification jointly. All of the investigated and proposed algorithms are tested and compared firstly on a number of small databases, such as Deterding Vowels Database, Fisher&#146;s IRIS database and German&#146;s GLASS database. Then they are tested in a large-scale speech recognition experiment based on TIMIT database.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feature extraction</field><field name="subject">dimensionality</field><field name="subject">pattern recognition</field><field name="subject">speech recognition</field><field name="subject">Linear Discriminant Analysis</field><field name="subject">LDA</field><field name="subject">Principal Component Analysis</field><field name="subject">PCA</field><field name="subject">Minimum Classification Error algorithm</field><field name="subject">MCE</field><field name="subject">Support Vector Machine</field><field name="subject">SVM</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030619.162803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information Technology Investment Decisions and Evaluation in Large Australian Companies: Theory and Practice Compared</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yen-Tsai</field><field name="description">Today's business environment is characterised by organisational dependence on information and communication technology. At the same time, this reliance on information technology and systems (IT/IS, hereafter IT) has given rise to concerns about how to evaluate IT investment initiatives. Issues such as the popular 'productivity paradox' and the broader 'value for IT money' (e.g., Brynjolfsson and Hitt 1998; Davern and Kauffman 2000) debate have further fuelled the extensive research in the area of IT investment and assessment. However, a review of current literature reveals a number of differences between IT investment assessment literature and traditional capital budgeting literature, particularly in the way that the entire decision making process is rarely discussed in IT investment decision making research. Instead, much attention has been focused on project justification or evaluation alone. Thus, it was argued for this research that an emphasis on the entire decision making process - from IT planning and analysis to post-implementation evaluation - is important, as potential organisational and other contextual variables that may not be apparent at the evaluation stage, can be better identified and appreciated. Another theme that this research seeks to investigate is the applicability and practicability of current IT decision making theories and evaluation methods discussed in the literature. Considering the breadth and depth of existing research in this area, IT investment decision making is, however, still seen as problematic today (e.g., Mahmood and Mann 2000). In particular, the literature reports a polarisation of empirical evidence towards the use of either over-optimistic or over-pessimistic forecasts of IT performance and return on investment (e.g., Irani et al. 1997). Thus, the usefulness of these theoretical models and techniques cannot be seen as clearly established. As a result, no single theory or technique can be said to be unequivocally successful in helping firms to evaluate IT investment opportunities and to identify where IT value lies. This discrepancy between the desired and the actual outcomes of IT investment decision making highlights a possible gap between what is offered in theory by researchers and what is used by practitioners. Gaining an understanding of the underlying issues associated with this gap is important, as its existence raises questions about the veracity of recent theoretical developments in IT investment decision making methodology. Hence, the research problem investigated in this research is: What is the level of applicability and practicability of the current theories and techniques relevant to IT investment decision making and evaluation, as observed in large Australian companies? To address the research question, this research was conducted by two studies. The first study adopted a survey methodology to establish the specific decision making content and process involved in IT investment. The collected data from this part of the research were used for both descriptive and inferential statistics analysis purposes. The second study consisted of three convergent interviews, which examined the significant institutional contexts that might influence the decision outcome, further adding meaning to the findings of the first study. The key findings of the research are that the planning, evaluation, and post-implementation evaluation activities for IT investments have not been performed widely and consistently. Although sophisticated evaluation methods have been developed over the years, they do not appear to have provided a satisfactory answer to improve IT decision making practice. It appears that the underlying problem with IT investment decision making cannot be explained by the inadequacy of the adopted evaluation techniques alone, and answers must also lie elsewhere. Two potential problem areas were found to be organisations' unenthusiastic attitude towards IT, and a general lack of applicability and practicability of current decision making and evaluation theories. The unenthusiastic attitude towards IT is explained by several factors as identified in this research. Particularly, they were related to: (1) difficulty with forecasting future business needs, (2) lack of time for sufficient IT planning, (3) performance of past IT investments leading to IT conservatism, (4) IT being generally seen as operating costs, (5) budgetary constraint, (6) competitors' imitation leading to undifferentiated or similar technology/process, (7) technologies fast becoming obsolete, and (8) organisation complexity, power structure, and existing policy and procedures all making change difficult. It was suggested that without fundamentally changing the way technology is perceived and treated by the business community, the value of IT will continue to be questioned and IT investment decision making will continue to be difficult. The lack of applicability and practicability of contemporary decision making and evaluation theories was also found to be significant, with very few organisations considering them to be useful. Four key factors impeding adequate system planning and evaluation were also uncovered: (1) business necessity remains a main IT driver, (2) IT is accepted as a cost of being in business, (3) users' IT needs must be met responsively, and (4) IT is inherently difficult to evaluate with any accuracy. As a result, organisations were often found to adopt the following evaluation strategies: (1) situational, rather than systematic evaluation, (2) a cost-management approach to evaluation, often resulting in the use of an excessive discount rate or cost of capital, (3) waiting for the technology in question to mature before investing. The contribution of this research is that it has both theoretical and practical significance. The theoretical significance of this research arises from insights into the existing body of theory and further, from theorising about the decision making practices as adopted by large Australian companies. At the same time, this research also serves as a practical reference for the development of decision making practice and policy. Only with a clear understanding of the important aspects involved in IT investment decision making, can organisations define and approach their investment tasks more successfully.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Australian companies</field><field name="subject">business environment</field><field name="subject">information technology systems</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070716.175827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Inquiry Into Oral-Visual Interaction Via Internet-Based Desktop Videoconferencing for Language Acquisition at a Distance</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yuping</field><field name="description">The research contained in this thesis involves three interdisciplinary dimensions: Distance Language Education (DLE) as the context of the research, videoconferencing as the technology, and the provision of oral and visual interaction in DLE as the core research problem. Though DLE is increasingly gaining importance at the start of 21st century, the inadequate provision of real-time oral-visual interaction still remains a major deficiency. To be more precise, DLE is still producing language learners who cannot speak the target language. I have outlined the urgency in solving this problem (Wang, 2004a), and it is precisely this urgency that grounds this research. This thesis therefore aims to answer the following central research question: in what ways is oral-visual interaction via videoconferencing able to facilitate L2 acquisition at a distance? In the course of answering the central research question, the following subsidiary questions are closely investigated: 1. What are the needs of distance learners in terms of L2 acquisition? 2. What are the benefits and limitations of videoconferencing-supported oral and visual interaction in the process of L2 acquisition? 3. What are the implications and potential of such interaction for L2 acquisition in distance mode? This thesis is set against a background of research on the importance of interaction in second language (L2) acquisition and the capabilities of Computer Mediated Communication (CMC).  Interaction has been regarded as an integral part of communicative language learning, which promotes L2 acquisition (see Gass, 2003; Hall, 1995; Kitade, 2000; Lantolf, 1994; Mitchell &amp; Myles, 1998; Ohta, 1995; Swain &amp; Lapkin,1995). However, the preliminary study in this research established that, in the context of DLE, this interactive dimension has been inadequately provided, and that distance language learners do need an improved platform for L2 acquisition, especially in terms of acquiring speaking skills.  The distance factor in distance language education calls for the employment of technology as a medium to provide an interactive platform for oral and visual interaction.  Thus, the empirical dimension of this research, involving the participation of both on-campus and distance language learners, witnesses a two-stage evaluation of a particular Internet-based desktop videoconferencing tool, NetMeeting. In this evaluation, NetMeeting was used to conduct videoconferencing sessions, in which the teacher and participants could see and hear each other during the completion of meaning-based tasks. A great deal of original data was collected from the qualitative evaluation in regard to the benefits and limitations of videoconferencing-supported oral and visual interaction in the process of L2 acquisition in distance mode. This evaluation is approached from two aspects: the technological capabilities and pedagogical values of videoconferencing. Recommendations on the use of videoconferencing and videoconferencing task designs are proposed on the basis of the research findings. These recommendations are highly significant for practitioners in this field. Following Murray (1999), a combination of data collection methods was employed in an attempt to effectively explore the scope and depth of the participants' learning experience through videoconferencing. These methods include pre- and post-trial written surveys, in-depth post-session and post-trial interviews, videotaped videoconferencing sessions and the researcher's personal observation. Qualitative data analysis methods were adopted. Particularly important is the use of Varonis and Gass's (1985) model for analysing the negotiation routines during meaning-based task completion. The contributions of this research are manifold. Theoretically, the research updates key definitions in DLE and CMC in keeping with recent developments in each respective field. In so doing, this thesis puts forward a theory of an emerging fourth generation DLE with synchronous oral-visual interaction as its defining feature (Wang &amp; Sun, 2001), and also proposes a new taxonomy in CMC (Wang, 2004). Both theories categorize more precisely the different roles played by different technologies and their implications for different learner goals. Empirically, this research first develops criteria for selecting appropriate videoconferencing tools (Wang &amp; Sun, 2001) and criteria for evaluating the appropriateness of videoconferencing tasks. These two sets of criteria were then applied in the two-stage evaluation of NetMeeting, yielding useful data (Wang, 2004a; Wang, 2004b). This research also contributes to our understanding of videoconferencing task design and performance principles. The significant findings from this research confirm that Internet-based desktop videoconferencing is capable of supporting oral-visual interaction in DLE and leads to significant improvements in L2 acquisition. Most importantly, this study informs future research into the nature of oral-visual interaction enabled by videoconferencing by demonstrating how and in what ways such interaction facilitates L2 acquisition. The rapid development of computer technology makes publishing the contributions of this study an ongoing part of this research, in order to maintain the originality of this study.  Some of the findings have been published in top-ranking international journals (see Wang and Sun, 2001; Wang, 2004a; Wang, 2004b). This study addresses a real and urgent need in distance language learning - the provision of oral-visual interaction.  Findings from this research shed light on many issues untreated in the literature and in the practices of DLE. They also point to possible future trends in the globalisation of education because the effects of the pedagogical distance between the learner and education provider may be neutralized, or at least, minimized, through the use of CMC.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Distance language education</field><field name="subject">videoconferencing in language education</field><field name="subject">oral and visual interaction in education</field><field name="subject">computer mediated communication</field><field name="subject">NetMeeting</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070215.132816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prospective Memory: Early Developmental Trajectory and Effects of Paediatric Traumatic Brain Injury on its Functioning</field><field name="creator">Ward, Heather Jean</field><field name="description">Very little is known about the effects of paediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) on prospective memory, the memory for future intentions such as remembering to post a letter in the morning or do homework.  The main aim of this thesis was to redress that shortcoming in the literature.  To investigate the effects of paediatric TBI on prospective memory as reliably and fully as possible, the study of children and adolescents with brain injuries was preceded by a developmental study. Given that the process of recovery from brain injury is imposed on the ongoing process of development, it is important to understand more about the normal developmental trajectory of prospective memory first of all.  Study 1 compared the prospective-memory performance of 88 normally developing children, adolescents and young adults.  The main task was computerised, and its design was influenced by a prefrontal-lobe model because prospective memory is believed to be mediated by the prefrontal regions of the brain. Variables associated with prefrontal-lobe capacity were manipulated:  the cognitive demand of an ongoing task, and the importance of the prospective task. Results of Study 1 found that children remembered to respond to fewer prospective cues than adolescents or adults, but that adolescents and adults remembered similarly. Further, the differences between the children's performance and the adolescents' and adults' widened as the cognitive demand of the ongoing task increased.  However, the effects of increasing the cognitive demand did not vary between the adolescents and adults.  It made no difference to anyone's performance whether the importance of remembering the prospective cues was stressed or not.  On the other hand, performance on executive functions, as measured by the Self-Ordered Pointing Task (SOPT), the Stroop Colour Word Interference Test (Stroop), and the Tower of London (TOL), which are also believed to be affected by prefrontal capacity, produced the same age effects as were produced on the computerised prospective-memory task.  Further, performance on the SOPT and Stroop predicted performance on the high-demand level of the prospective-memory task.  Study 2 compared 34 children and adolescents with TBI with the non-injured children and adolescents from Study 1 on the same tasks.  Results revealed that overall those with TBI had poorer prospective-memory performance than their non-injured peers.  However, a different pattern of impairment was evident in the children than in the adolescents.  Specifically, the children with TBI performed similarly to their non-injured peers, but the adolescents with TBI were significantly worse than the non-injured adolescents. This trend was most noticeable as the cognitive demand of the ongoing task increased.  Further, the age and injury effects were reflected in the performances on the executive-function tests, and the TOL predicted performance on the high-demand, prospective-memory task in those with TBI.  Study 3 aimed to examine the ecological validity of Study 2, by investigating whether the impairments in prospective memory in young people with TBI measured quantitatively, were matched with qualitative data.  Twelve parents of children and adolescents with mild to severe TBI were interviewed about whether or not their children's injuries impacted on their memory (retrospective and prospective) in everyday life.  Results showed that in general most children suffered memory losses as a result of their brain injuries, and that prospective-memory loss caused particular hardships for the children and their families.  Taken together, the results of the current research revealed that the development of prospective memory reaches a peak of maturity in adolescence, and that adolescents with TBI show greater decrements in prospective memory than adolescents without TBI, but that this pattern is not evident in children, where those with TBI were not significantly different from those without.  These findings give support to the prefrontal-lobe model of prospective memory by showing that prefrontal maturity, which reaches a peak during adolescence, reflects the prospective-memory performance of healthy adolescents, and prefrontal injury, which is very common with TBI, shows the effects of deficits more during adolescence than in earlier years when the prefrontal regions are not yet fully developed.

As a follow up it is recommended that rehabilitation strategies be designed to assist young people with prospective-memory impairments adjust better to school and the demands of everyday living.

It shows that the types of interpretation people make when reading such texts often differ from those they make when they are hearing the same texts read aloud. The extent of the difference is demonstrated in ten studies where theories relating to reading and hearing are applied to the Greek text of Mark 6:30-8:27a. The biblical texts used in the studies vary in the size, as do the themes and issues investigated. Despite this diversity the results are consistent across all ten studies. Almost all the assessments made in these studies are verified by independent data, such as the published opinions of biblical scholars and literary analyses of the Greek text. As elucidated in the thesis; the results attained, the method utilised and the theories employed are relevant for assessing the types of interpretation people are likely to make when reading and listening to other biblical stories. Because the research encompasses a literary issue and concerns the processes that are used in communication, the approach adopted is a literary one and the methodology incorporates media criticism and audience criticism. Other techniques, such as narrative criticism, rhetorical criticism, and reader response criticism are utilised extensively in the various analyses and assessments. The ten studies are preceded in the thesis by data as to the processes people use in reading texts and in listening to non-reciprocal speech. Such data includes information relating to experiments and studies into the communicative processes that have been carried out over the past fifty years. There is also data as to the theories that have been developed by scholars based on the results of such experiments and studies. These are the theories that are used in this thesis. There are also several analyses in the thesis which collectively demonstrate that texts used in Church liturgies should be those that have been specifically translated to meet the needs of listeners. This is a very important issue, because, even in very literate communities, there are still more Christians who listen to biblical texts being read than those who read such texts for themselves.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biblical text</field><field name="subject">Greek biblical text</field><field name="subject">Church liturgies</field><field name="subject">listening and reading</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051107.144940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the decision to adopt multiple unit franchising arrangements</field><field name="creator">Weaven, Scott</field><field name="description">Franchising performs an important role in the production and distribution of goods and services.  Current research suggests that much of the future growth in franchising in many world economies will be attributable to the growth in multiple unit franchising arrangements.  Multiple unit franchising refers to an organisational arrangement in which franchisees are permitted to own more than one unit in the same franchise system.  Although the Australian franchising sector has reached an early stage of maturity, the limited acceptance of multiple unit practices contrasts with overseas experiences.  This remains a curious anomaly, as significantly higher levels of multiple unit ownership are observable in comparably mature markets in other countries. Multiple unit franchising appears a conceptually unsound alternative to traditional dyadic revenue sharing franchising relationships as it does not benefit from the structural and operational synergies commensurate with ownership attention at the unit level.  Therefore, from the franchisor's perspective, multiple unit franchising appears a suboptimal alternative to traditional franchising.  From the franchisee's perspective, alternative investment opportunities may present superior choices to multiple unit arrangements.  Franchisees have only limited control of their organisation, pay substantial percentages of their gross revenues in the form of fees and royalties, and forgo the ability to capitalise on the growth in the value of their intangible assets. While these apparent disadvantages may be overcome by an individual's desire to 'buy a job', the reasons explaining a franchisee's desire to own multiple units is less clear.  Recent research has attempted to explain the ubiquity and increasing popularity of this organisational form, given these operational disadvantages, albeit mostly from the perspective of the franchisor.    Previous empirical research in the United States views multiple unit franchising as a driver of system growth, promoting system-wide adaptation to competition.  However, this conventional wisdom fails to consider additional franchisor motivational incentives.  Moreover, anecdotal evidence in the Australian franchising sector contrasts markedly with the relationships exposed in multiple unit analyses overseas. Thus, existing franchising research does not adequately capture the range of incentives motivating an entrepreneur's decision to elect the franchising channel of distribution.  In addition, at this time no theoretical framework exists espousing the reasons that lead to a franchisee's adoption of these hybridised organisational forms.  This has led some researchers to conclude that multiple unit franchising is in an embryonic stage.  Further complicating our understanding of the choice of this organisational form is the absence of multiple unit incentives analysis in Australia.   In addition to gaining valuable insights into current managerial practice, the first purpose of this research is to support informed decision-making in the future through an investigation of the fundamental and under-researched question of why franchisors choose to grow and expand through multiple unit arrangements.  This research focuses upon theory development by integrating known concepts with newly identified motivational incentives that caveat the adoption of this organisational arrangement.  These incentives are incorporated in a model of multiple unit franchising from the perspective of the franchisor.  The model describes multiple unit franchising as a function of the context of franchise system context (age, system corporatisation, plurality of distribution, geographic dispersion of available units and level of existing intra-firm conflict), and strategic (ownership redirection, perceived future agency cost minimisation, and system rewards) factors.  In an attempt to extend the cross cultural boundaries of previous franchising research, a given level of multiple unit expansion is described through the predicted outcome of franchise system growth.  Secondly, this research investigates the reasons why franchisees become multiple unit holders.  This process involved the integration of existing theories drawn from different disciplines and presents an integrated theoretical model explaining why individuals are driven to create their own subsystems within a franchisor-owned network.  The multi-perspective approach is critical to advancing our understanding of the genesis of this organisational arrangement, and specifically the issues of who should engage in multiple unit franchising arrangements, and when franchisors and franchisees should sanction and adopt mini-chains within a single franchising system.  Thus, this proposal addresses gaps in the literature by investigating the research question: What are the motivational incentives that influence franchisors and franchisees to adopt multiple unit franchising? That is, this thesis aims to identify the reasons that justify the existence of multiple unit franchising forms from the franchisor and franchisee perspectives.  A three-stage methodological approach is used in this research.  Franchisor motivations are examined within stages one and two.  Franchisee motivations are detailed in section three.  An examination of the parent disciplines of resource scarcity theory, agency theory, and the immediate discipline of multiple unit franchising resulted in the development of a preliminary conceptual model and general set of propositions explaining why franchisors choose to engage in multiple unit franchising arrangements.  In stage one an exploratory survey of seven franchisors from a range of industries of different type, size and age was conducted using a convergent interviewing technique, to gather insights and reasons into multiple unit practices.  The stage one findings were used to clarify and confirm the appropriateness of the conceptual model of multiple unit franchising.	 Permission was granted by the Franchise Council of Australia to include a limited number of questions in the Franchising Australia 2002 survey.  In the (second) stage of this research, a sample of the population of franchisors in Australia was surveyed by an electronic questionnaire administered on the World Wide Web in June and July 2002.  The resultant data was analysed to test a revised theoretical model of franchisor motivations to adopt multiple unit franchising arrangements.  Inferential statistical tests were used to test the relationships hypothesised in the model of multiple unit franchising from the franchisor's perspective.  The results built upon the inductive stage of the research, providing a descriptive snapshot of multiple unit franchising in Australia.  The third stage of this research explored the factors influencing a franchisee's decision to become a multiple unit owner.  Following a review of the predominantly single unit literature, a model and series of general propositions explaining multiple unit franchising was developed explaining multiple unit ownership in terms of subsystem size (expected decision making power and anticipated subsystem economies of scale), franchisee context (franchisee liquidity, entrepreneurial orientation), and strategic (pre-empt future intra-system competition) factors.  The appropriateness of the conceptual model and propositions were tested through convergent interviews with ten multiple unit and nine single unit franchisees within a prominent fast-food system.  This resulted in a revised conceptual model and general set of propositions that contribute to the development of existing theory and will form the basis of future empirical assessment.  This research makes an original contribution to the body of knowledge about multiple unit practice through inductive analysis that not only recognises the reach of this franchising phenomenon, but also develops our theoretical understanding of why franchisors and franchisees engage in intra-firm mini-chain development.  So, apart from gaining valuable insight into current managerial motivations and practice in Australia, a concomitant aim of this research is to enhance the generalisability of prior franchising theory developed in the United States through examination of the under-researched areas of why franchisors allow, and franchisees choose, to own more than one unit within the same franchising system. This research has contributed to the body of knowledge on franchising.  Based upon the extant literature and exploratory analyses, models of multiple unit franchising from the franchisor and franchisee perspective were developed.  It is the first empirical analysis of multiple unit franchising in Australia and provides a starting point for future research.  This research has made a valuable contribution in being the first to: investigate multiple unit franchising in an Australian setting using primary data sources; utilise an inductive convergent interviewing technique to clarify and confirm the appropriateness of theories derived from the extant literatures; survey a large representative sample of Australian franchisors about multiple unit franchising; survey a sample of franchisees about multiple unit franchising; incorporate aspects of agency theory, resource constraints theory and multiple unit franchising to develop a model of multiple unit franchising; use a three-stage methodology involving qualitative and quantitative analyses; investigate motivations and factors influencing multiple unit franchising choice; introduce new constructs and reposition existing constructs into multiple unit franchising theory. In conclusion, this original and comprehensive research has found that more experienced Australian franchisors appear to adopt multiple unit franchising, possibly as a method of sustaining growth in units and system-wide sales. Furthermore, entrepreneurial franchisees appear to source private sources of equity in order to grow their holdings sequentially as they anticipate savings accruing from economies of scale while limiting competition within their franchise system.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">franchises</field><field name="subject">franchising</field><field name="subject">multiple unit franchising</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041014.161109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolic Responses to Supramaximal Exercise and Training: A Gender Comparison</field><field name="creator">Weber, Clare L.</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this thesis was to investigate the gender-specific responses to supramaximal cycling and to examine the changes in anaerobic and aerobic metabolism that occur in response to high-intensity interval training (HIT).  All subjects in the present experiments were untrained, healthy young adults aged between 18 and 35 yr.  Cycle ergometry was used for all experimental test procedures and training programs.  The accumulated oxygen (AO2) deficit was used to quantify the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via anaerobic metabolism during supramaximal cycling.  In addition, pulmonary oxygen uptake measured at the onset of exercise was described using mathematical modeling to determine the rate response of the aerobic energy system during exercise. The purpose of experiment one was to examine the test-retest reliability of the maximal accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD) measured at 110% and 120% of peak oxygen uptake for cycling in seven untrained male and seven untrained female subjects.  After one familiarization trial, all subjects performed two MAOD tests at a power output corresponding to 110% and two tests at 120% of peak oxygen uptake in random order.  MAOD was calculated for each subject as the difference between the estimated AO2 demand and the AO2 uptake measured during the exercise bout.  The mean&#177;standard error time to exhaustion (TE) for the group was not significantly different between trial one (226&#177;13 s) and trial two (223&#177;14 s) of the 110% test.  Likewise, the difference in the TE between trial one (158&#177;11 s) and trial two (159&#177;10 s) was not significant for the 120% test.  The intra-class correlation coefficients for the TE were 0.95 for the 110% test and 0.98 for the 120% test.  The mean MAOD value obtained in trial one (2.62&#177;0.17 L) was not significantly different from the mean value obtained in trial two (2.54&#177;0.19 L) for the 110% test.  Additionally, the mean values for the two trials did not differ significantly for MAOD (2.64&#177;0.21 L for trial one and 2.63&#177;0.19 L for trial two) in the 120% test.  The intra-class correlation coefficients for MAOD were 0.95 for the 110% test and 0.97 for the 120% test.  All intra-class correlation coefficients were significant at p &lt; 0.001.  When conducted under standardized conditions, the determination of MAOD for cycling was highly repeatable at both 110% and 120% of peak oxygen uptake in untrained male and female subjects. The results observed in experiment one suggest that the MAOD may be used to compare the anaerobic capacity (AC) of men and women and to examine changes in the contribution of the anaerobic energy systems before and after training.  Experiment two examined the gender-specific differences in MAOD before and after 4 and 8 wk of HIT.  Untrained men (n=7) and women (n=7) cycled at 120% of pre-training peak oxygen uptake to exhaustion (MAOD test) pre-, mid-, and post-training.  A post-training timed test was also completed at the MAOD test power output, but this test was stopped at the TE achieved during the pre-training MAOD test.  The 14.3&#177;5.2% increase in MAOD observed in males after 4 wk of training was not different from the 14.0&#177;3.0% increase seen in females (p &gt; 0.05).  MAOD increased by a further 6.6&#177;1.9% in males and this change was not different from the additional 5.1&#177;2.3% increase observed in females after the final 4 wk of training.  Peak oxygen uptake  measured during incremental cycling increased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) in male but not in female subjects after 8 wk of training.  Moreover, the AO2 uptake was higher in men during the post-training timed test compared to the pre-training MAOD test (p &lt; 0.01).  In contrast, the AO2 uptake was unchanged from pre- to post-training in female subjects.  The increase in MAOD with training was not different between men and women suggesting an enhanced ability to produce ATP anaerobically in both groups.  However, the increase in peak oxygen uptake and AO2 uptake obtained in male subjects following training indicates improved oxidative metabolism in men but not in women.  It was concluded that there are basic gender differences that may predispose males and females to specific metabolic adaptations following an 8-wk period of HIT. Increases in AO2 uptake during supramaximal cycling demonstrated in men after training led to the hypothesis that peak oxygen uptake kinetics are speeded in male subjects with short-term HIT.  It was suggested that training does not improve peak oxygen uptake kinetics in women as no change in AO2 uptake was found after 8 wk of HIT in female subjects.  The purpose of experiment three was to examine peak oxygen uptake kinetics before and after 8 wk of HIT in six men and six women during cycling at 50% (50% test) and 110% (110% test) of pre-training peak oxygen uptake.  A single-term exponential equation was used to model the peak oxygen uptake response (after phase I) during the 50% and 110% tests pre- and post-training.  In addition, phase II and III of the peak oxygen uptake response during the 110% tests were examined using a two-term equation.  The end of the phase I peak oxygen uptake response was identified visually and omitted from the modeling process.  The duration of phase I determined during all experimental tests was not different between men and women and did not change with training in either group.  Before training, men obtained a phase II peak oxygen uptake time constant (t2) of 29.0&#177;3.3 s during the 50% test which was not different to the t2 of 28.8&#177;2.2 s attained by women.  In addition, the t2 determined during the 50% test was unchanged after 8 wk of HIT in both groups.  The peak oxygen uptake kinetics examined during the 110% tests before training were well described by a single-term model in all male and female subjects.  The t2 determined before training for the 110% test was significantly faster in men than in women.  Furthermore, peak oxygen uptake was unchanged in female subjects and the t2 remained unaltered with 8 wk HIT (pre 45.5&#177;2.2; post 44.8&#177;2.3 s).  In contrast, male subjects achieved a significantly higher peak oxygen uptake after training and the t2 determined for men during the 110% test was faster after training (36.4&#177;1.6 s) than before training (40.1&#177; 1.9 s).  Improved model fits were obtained with the two-term equation compared to the single-term equation in two of the six male subjects during the 110% test post-training.  It was found that the onset of the peak oxygen uptake slow component occurred at a mean time of 63.5&#177;2.5 s and the t2 was reduced to 18.4&#177;1.7 s.  Using a Wilcoxon Signed Ranks z-test, the t2 described by the single-term equation in the remaining four subjects was determined to be significantly faster after training than before training, thus confirming the results obtained from the original group (n=6) of male subjects.  End exercise heart rate (HREE) values obtained during the 50% and 110% tests were not different between men and women.  During the 50% test, HREE values were unchanged, whereas HREE was significantly decreased during the 110% test after training in both groups.  These data show that HIT might improve oxidative metabolism in men but not in women as reflected by a greater peak oxygen uptake and faster peak oxygen uptake kinetics during supramaximal work rates.  We further suggest that the faster peak oxygen uptake kinetics demonstrated in men after training are probably not due to an improvement in cardiac function.  Finally, the augmentation of oxidative metabolism during exercise after HIT in men might be dependent on the intensity of the exercise bout at which the peak oxygen uptake response is examined. The findings presented in this thesis suggest that MAOD is a reliable measure in both male and female subjects and can be used to monitor changes in anaerobic ATP production during supramaximal cycling.  Moreover, these data suggest that 4 and 8 wk of HIT produce similar changes in anaerobic ATP generation in men and women.  Finally, 8 wk of HIT results in the increase of peak oxygen uptake and AO2 uptake as well as the speeding of peak oxygen uptake kinetics during supramaximal cycling in male subjects.  There was no evidence to suggest that oxidative metabolism was improved in women after short-term HIT.  In conclusion, improvement in supramaximal exercise performances should be examined specifically for changes in the anaerobic and aerobic contributions to energy production.  In addition, it is suggested that gender should be of primary consideration when designing exercise-training programs where improvement in both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism is required.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metabolic responses</field><field name="subject">supramaximal exercise and training</field><field name="subject">gender differences</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030407.155407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Ecological Approach to the Prevention of Anxiety Disorders during Childhood</field><field name="creator">Webster, Hayley Monique</field><field name="description">Research shows that anxiety disorders are common and problematic in children. Treatment studies demonstrate that cognitive-behavioural interventions for children can successfully minimise these problems. Further, when implemented as early intervention or prevention programs, these interventions can prevent the onset of anxiety problems in 7 to 14 year olds and reduce existing levels of anxiety. This type of preventive approach has enormous potential for improving community mental health in a low cost model of service delivery. Yet, to develop this as a viable service model, these programs need to be evaluated under 'real world' conditions as opposed to specialist university clinical teams.   In this research, the long-term effectiveness of an ecological model of the prevention of anxiety disorders for children was conducted.  In the first study, teachers  (N = 17) were trained intensively in the principles of anxiety and the FRIENDS anxiety prevention program (Barrett, Lowry-Webster &amp; Holmes, 1999).  Measures were taken of the PROXIMAL effects of training on the knowledge and self-efficacy of participating teachers at two points in time.  Compared to teachers in a control group (N= 17) and a group comprised of psychologists regarded as experts in the FRIENDS anxiety program (N= 22), trained teachers demonstrated significant increases in the levels of knowledge and self-efficacy at time two.  These increases approached levels exhibited by experts in terms of knowledge, and were not significantly different from experts in their levels of self-efficacy to implement the FRIENDS program following training.  This study also explored the quality or fidelity of program implementation by these trained teachers (INTERMEDIATE EFFECTS).  Results demonstrated that trained teachers implemented the program with high levels of integrity in accordance with the FRIENDS intervention manual.   The second study sought to investigate the outcomes for participating children in terms of actually preventing and reducing existing levels of anxiety.  Also of interest was the impact this intervention had on levels of depression.  Participants were 594 children aged 10-13 years from 7 schools in Brisbane Australia.  Children, and parents reported on children's social, emotional and behavioural characteristics at three-assessment points over 12 months.  Results were examined universally (for all children) and for children who scored above the clinical cut-off for anxiety at pre-test.  Results revealed that children in the FRIENDS intervention group reported fewer anxiety symptoms regardless of their risk status at posttest.  In terms of reported levels of depression, only the high anxiety group who completed the FRIENDS intervention evidenced significant improvements at posttest.  The results indicated that intervention gains were maintained over a period of 12 months, as measured by self-reports and diagnostic interviews.  Moreover, evidence of a prevention effect was also demonstrated, with a significantly greater percentage of children in the control group progressed to "at risk" or "remained at risk" compared to children in the intervention group.  Additionally, 85% of children in the intervention group who were scoring above the clinical cut-off for anxiety and depression were diagnosis free in the intervention condition at 12-month follow-up, compared to only 31.2% of children in the control group. Implications of these findings are examined, alongside limitations of the study and directions for future research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child psychology</field><field name="subject">anxiety disorders</field><field name="subject">anxiety disorders in children</field><field name="subject">cognitive-behavioural therapy</field><field name="subject">FRIENDS anxiety program</field><field name="subject">preventive mental health services</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030807.105928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Existential Framework of Spirituality for Education</field><field name="creator">Webster, Robert Scott</field><field name="description">The research reported here addressed the questions 'what is spirituality?' and 'how should spiritual development be provided in education?'.  The literature reviewed indicated confusion and uncertainty over the meaning of the concept spirituality, and the only guidance as to how spiritual development should be facilitated, was mainly from a religious perspective.  This however, proved to be problematic for adoption into state-run educational institutions, where religious education is not provided for. As spiritual development is an aspect of the overall educative development of individuals, attention was given to what is meant by both 'education' and the 'educated person'.  This initial research provided the context by which spiritual development could be understood and grounded in accepted and well argued notions of what interventions into the development of the individual are to count as educational.  This also clarified the context for which the formulated framework of spirituality was to have implications. The major approach of this research was philosophical, in that an existential perspective was sought to develop a framework of spirituality that was able to embrace both religious and secular contexts of education.   The major works examined were those written by S&#248;ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger, because these were argued to have most relevance for spirituality and spiritual development of the educated person.  While these works were analysed one philosopher at a time, the existential perspective that was relevant for spirituality was developed using common themes found in their writings.  Consequently this approach produced a rather eclectic view of Existentialism that down-plays the many differences that exist between these philosophers. An existential framework of spirituality was then formulated using the philosophy of these contributors as the foundation.  This framework is argued to be more effective than the other frameworks of spirituality that were identified in the literature reviewed.  Its implications for education practice were developed and argued.  The evaluative applicability of the framework was then illustrated and tested through a critique of an educational project in Queensland.  It was beyond the scope of this thesis to test the framework any further than this particular case.  However, further research is recognised as being required to test other aspects of the framework.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spirituality for education</field><field name="subject">teaching (religious aspects)</field><field name="subject">existentialism</field><field name="subject">spiritual formation</field><field name="subject">spiritual direction</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070215.170759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Top-Level Structuring and Teacher Education: A Case Study of Four Early Childhood Student Teachers</field><field name="creator">Wegner, Alicia Cortes</field><field name="description">A central tenet of this study is the notion that a reader's metacognition affects understanding. Identifying the organisational structure of text is a valuable tool for comprehending and recalling the writer's message. In this study, participants learned to identify text structure and to direct use of that knowledge toward facilitating their academic work. The research is about students acquiring a new strategy and adjusting it to meet the academic requirements of authentic tasks in their real life context. Theoretical bases for this research included metacognition, strategy acquisition, and top-level structure strategy. A review of the literature was conducted into teacher education, lifelong literacy, and top-level structure strategy. It uncovered limited data on strategic behaviour involving the target strategy in authentic contexts. Using case study method I examined if and how student teachers developed learning behaviour using top-level structure strategy (TLS) as the target strategy. This provided a theorization of the process by which each participant became a strategist. The theory describes and predicts that some learners adopt a strategy and find it useful, some adopt a strategy and then adapt it to suit perceived needs and complement existing strategies, and others try the target strategy, decide it is not effective, and reject it. The theory, while attractive, needs to be tested beyond limitations of the method used here, and warrants replication studies, particularly broader research using quantitative methods. A qualitative, case study design was used to examine and describe the effects of strategic instructional intervention. The study was conducted in the school of early childhood teacher education in which the researcher works as lecturer and Year 1 Dean. Ethical consideration was given to the recruitment process to ensure participants' well-being and volunteers were sought from among Year 2 students. Four women participated in the study, three enrolled full-time, and one enrolled part-time. Data were gathered from pre- and post-intervention tasks and questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and written journals. They were analysed using thematic methods of analysis. A final member-check with participants was conducted eight months after the end of intervention and data collection. Study findings provided insights into students' academic experiences. Prior to an instructional intervention, participants used a range of study strategies in academic work with limited metacognitive awareness. Instruction about top-level strategy benefited them in direct ways by providing a top-level structuring technique for completing academic tasks, and in indirect ways by providing a metalanguage for thinking about strategic behaviour, evaluating it, and customizing their technique. Comparison of task performance and questionnaire responses demonstrated qualitative changes in participants' approaches to reading text after instruction. Findings provided the basis for theorizing about participants' metacognitive development across the intervention. Interviews and focus groups provided additional information regarding participants' cognitive self-awareness, active engagement in learning, and application and adaptation of target strategy. Journal entries exemplified participants' authentic applications of the strategy and provided descriptions of their strategic behaviour. The instructional intervention affected participants' perceptions of the academic experience. They became more overtly reflective about how they read and wrote, particularly in relation to assessment items, and more expressive about the nature of their own learning. Study findings based on four participants in one particular context are sufficiently robust as case study research to warrant a broader quantitative study to test their generalization. Such an extension would provide guidance for teacher educators with decisions of policy and practice that might influence explicit attention to how student teachers in early childhood education learn about learning as part of their preparation for the profession.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metacognition</field><field name="subject">strategy acquisition</field><field name="subject">top-level structure strategy</field><field name="subject">target strategy</field><field name="subject">academic experiences</field><field name="subject">student teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070327.161435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Future of International Media Coverage of Military Operations</field><field name="creator">Weiland, John</field><field name="description">Given the nature of modem warfare and the impact that technology has in contemporary war reporting, the primary objective of this thesis is to identify the most likely means by which the international media will cover future military operations. Initial research concentrates on the cultural and systemic ethos of the military and media professions and examines whether any differences have an adverse impact on how they operate during periods of armed conflict. A brief review of the history of war reporting is undertaken for several purposes; firstly, to discover if any differences between the professions have had a historical basis and, secondly, to ascertain whether there is any historical evidence of the media compromising military operations when covering operations during armed conflict. It was found that one of the principle reasons why the military and the meha have been traditional adversaries is that the military sees secrecy as vital for the successful conduct of its operations. The media, on the other hand, seeks complete disclosure. In what is considered to be the first of its type undertaken in Australia, a comprehensive survey was conducted to identify how each profession viewed the other. Research concentrated on the US and Australian models, examining how modern technology has made it more difficult for the dtary to control the media than in past conflicts. Research further identified that in the context of modern armed conflict, the military and the media have predominantly different and frequently competing interests. It was also found that the protection and advancement of their interests are affected by technological changes which are redefining the nature of modern warfare, and the means and capacity of the media to report it. The way the media gathers news during conflict was shown to have changed dramatically over the past ten years, particularly with its use of technology in transmitting news live from a battlefield back to a parent media organisation. The military was further seen as dramatically changing the manner in which it conducts warfare, including the introduction of initiatives aimed at neutralising the media's impact on operational security. Somewhat alarmingly, these initiatives not only minimise possible compromises of security but overall media criticism as well. Research also found that the tensions currently existing between the military and media can be resolved by both parties agreeing to a more effective way of reconciling their differences. However, it was found that any well meaning initiatives by the military and the media to work closer together during periods of conflict will be difficult to achieve if the ever-present political manipulation of news is not addressed. The thesis concludes by recommending changes to current military and media doctrine in order that future conflicts may be covered in a manner that fulfils the 'public's right to know,' while at the same time, allows the military to conduct operations without fear that security may be compromised by the subsequent media coverage.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">War reporting</field><field name="subject">media coverage of war</field><field name="subject">military security</field><field name="subject">public's right to know</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051104.143303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ANCI Competencies: An Investigation of Uniqueness and Importance</field><field name="creator">Wells, Elaine</field><field name="description">This study investigates the uniqueness and importance of the Australian National Competency Committee (ANCI) competencies to nurses and other health professionals. Very few Australian studies (Battersby, 1994; Hearn, Smith, Southerly &amp; Close, 1995) have addressed this issue. Although there is widespread confusion of the term "competency", professional bodies regard competency standards as a process for supporting the integrity and control of their respective professions. The problem is that there is confusion across the health professions about competencies and their agenda. ANCI suggest that the nursing competencies reflect unique characteristics of nursing as well as those common with other professions. However, competencies that are unique to nursing have not been identified. ANCI have also not identified how competencies can enhance the development of nursing as a profession. The identification of differences in perceptions of uniqueness and importance of the ANCI competencies within nursing and across health professional groups may contribute to the debate on what is needed to achieve competence and those factors that may influence nursing autonomy, education, and future professional development. This study is important to assist in the identification of nursing as a profession in its own right. It will assist the arguments for and against economic reform in professional education courses and transfer of skills and competence across professions. This study compares the perceptions of nurses, physiotherapists, speech pathologists, and occupational therapists about the uniqueness and importance of the ANCI competencies to their professions. Participants completed a questionnaire that listed the ANCI competencies. They were asked to rate each competency first on uniqueness to their profession, and second, on importance to their profession. Two surveys were conducted; one in 1997 and the second in 2000. Surveys examined any change in perception over time by different cohort groups. The study takes a quantitative approach to data collection and analysis. Inferential analysis determined statistically significant differences and similarities of the four participating health professional groups. The differences are examined in relation to the characteristics that define a profession and implications for nursing are examined in relation to research, autonomy, and patient advocacy within an evidence-based practice framework. Eight hundred and thirty-one of questionnaires distributed were used in this study. The results showed that nursing emerged as significantly different to the other three health professions on perception of uniqueness of the competencies. Nineteen of the sixty-five competencies were perceived by nurses to be more unique to the nursing profession. This perception of uniqueness was found across all the four domains of the ANCI competencies. Although ANCI (2000) claimed that the competencies reflect the unique characteristics of nursing these characteristics have not previously been identified. This finding provides some support for the claim made by ANCI by identifying those competencies nurses perceive as more unique. The study findings showed also that the four participating health professions rated the ANCI competencies as important. However, there was a significant difference between nurses and the other three professional groups on the ratings of importance of the competencies of professional and ethical practice. The study found that nurses rated the competencies of this domain as more important than the other three professions rated these competencies. The findings indicate that the rank orders of importance of the competencies are different across the four professions. This reflects and indicates the different priorities and work roles of each of the four professional groups. It is interesting as well as being of concern to nursing that the participating nurses ranked research and management of care as being the least important of all of the competencies. This finding may help to explain why nursing research has been slow to develop in spite of changes to nursing education. Nurses have a subordinate past and are often described as doers rather than thinkers. It appears that this may not have changed. Current practice also reflects a dependency on other health professions such as the medical profession (Adamson &amp; Harris, 1996). Finally, the study found that there was no change in nurses' perceptions of uniqueness over time. However, there was a slight increase in the nurses' ratings of importance of Critical Thinking and Analysis. There were no statistical significant differences for age, gender, year of graduation, state of residence, and employment status. The discussion chapter commences with an outline of the perceived importance of the competencies across the different health professions. Discussion compares the findings and methods of two important Australian studies of competencies (Battersby, 1994; Hearn et al. 1995, 1996) to this study. Discussion examines professionalism and identifies areas where nursing's perceptions of the competencies meet the criteria of a profession and where the four health professions have similar and different perspectives and qualities. Six characteristics of a profession that are discussed in relation to the perceptions of the ANCI competencies are: high intellectual functioning, special body of knowledge, responsibility and accountability, code of ethics, autonomy, and collegiality. The third part of the discussion highlights the implications of this studies' findings in relation to ANCI competencies as an evaluation tool, the empowerment of nurses, generic courses, scope of nursing, professional development, and curriculum development. The thesis concludes by arguing that 1) The ANCI competencies have the potential to increase the professionalism of nursing; 2) Nurses value accountability and responsibility, the code of ethics, and collegiality; 3) Nurses appear uncomfortable with the concept of autonomy; 4) Nurses undervalue high intellectual functioning and the importance of a body of knowledge; and 5) Perceptions are influenced by the context of competencies. The final chapter highlights a number of recommendations for nursing practice that include the need for further investigation of the uniqueness of the ANCI competencies. It is argued that there is a need for a number of changes to the ANCI competency list as well as a greater emphasis on research and management of care and support for discipline specific courses.It is apparent from the findings of this study that nursing education and clinical practice would benefit from the placement of more emphasis on the importance of research. Furthermore, nurses need to take better responsibility for pursing opportunities and funding for research and practice management. It is concluded that nursing research will increase the body of knowledge for the profession and will also increase professional autonomy with an outcome of better client care. Nurses need encouragement from administrators and educators to value management of care and the nursing process, as this will also encourage independence and quality of care provision. It is argued that commonalities in the perception of uniqueness and importance of competencies are not grounds for politicians to suggest the implementation of generic health professional courses. The commonality of the competencies being important to all four professions can be attributed to the complex nature of nursing practice, which captures aspects of other health professional roles and many of the competencies contribute to the characteristics that define a profession. There are differences in the rankings that can be attributed to the nature of knowledge, context, and priorities of the different professions. Each profession has its own governing body that ensures its members obtain an acceptable standard of professional competence and education. It has, and always will be, the responsibility of the profession to shape the service it provides (Pyne, 1998). This study highlights nurses' perceptions of competencies. The recognition of these perceptions could be used to guide nursing's strive toward autonomy, professional development, and recognition as a profession in its own right.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">competency</field><field name="subject">competencies</field><field name="subject">competency-based assessment</field><field name="subject">nurse education</field><field name="subject">nursing profession</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030527.132438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scattering of Spin Polarized Electrons from Heavy Atoms: Krypton and Rubidium</field><field name="creator">Went, Michael Ray</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a set of measurements of spin asymmetries from the heavy atoms krypton and rubidium. These investigations allow examination of the spin orbit interaction for electron scattering from the target atoms. These measurements utilise spin polarized electrons in a crossed beam experiment to measure the Sherman function from krypton and the A2 parameter from the 52P state of rubidium. The measurements utilise a new spin polarized electron energy spectrometer which is designed to operate in the 20-200 eV range. The apparatus consists of a standard gallium arsenide polarized electron source, a 180 degrees hemispherical electron analyser to detect scattered electrons and a Mott detector to measure electron polarization. A series of measurements of the elastic Sherman function were performed on krypton at incident electron energies of 20, 50, 60, 65, 100, 150 and 200 eV. Scattered electrons are measured over an angular range of 30-130 degrees. These measurements are compared with calculations of the Sherman function which are obtained by solution of the Dirac-Fock equations. These calculations include potentials to account for dynamic polarization and loss of flux into inelastic channels. At the energies 50, 60 and 65 eV, experimental agreement with theory is seen to be extremely dependent on the theoretical model used. Measurement of the A2 parameter from the combined 52P1/2,3/2 state of rubidium are performed at an incident energy of 20 eV. The scattered electrons are measured over an angular range of 30-110 degrees. This measurement represents the first such measurement of this parameter for rubidium. Agreement with preliminary calculations performed using the R-matrix technique are good and are expected to improve with further theoretical development.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spin polarized electrons</field><field name="subject">electron scattering</field><field name="subject">krypton</field><field name="subject">rubidium</field><field name="subject">spin polarized electron energy spectrometer</field><field name="subject">elastic Sherman function</field><field name="subject">Dirac-Fock equations</field><field name="subject">R-matrix technique</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040220.134142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Cause-Related Marketing on Consumer Attitude to the Brand and Purchase Intention: A Comparison with Sponsorship and Sales Promotion</field><field name="creator">Westberg, Kathleen J.</field><field name="description">Cause-related marketing is an emerging area within the marketing discipline, originating in the United States in the 1980s. This thesis defines the term cause-related marketing as a marketing strategy whereby the firm makes a contribution, financial or otherwise, to a nonprofit organisation(s) contingent upon the customer engaging in a revenue providing exchange that satisfies business and individual objectives.  This strategy may include additional elements such as sponsorship, sales promotion, co-branding and employee involvement.  -- In examining the literature relating to cause-related marketing, a need for further research was identified for a number of reasons.  First, there is considerable investment and growth in this strategy both in Australia and overseas.  Second, academic and practitioner research have indicated strong consumer support for the concept of cause-related marketing, yet there has been limited evidence to date regarding the effectiveness of this strategy, especially in comparison to other marketing strategies.  Finally, in an increasingly challenging business environment, marketing practitioners are seeking to explore new strategies and the efficacy of traditional forms of marketing communications is subject to debate.  As such, this thesis explored the following research questions: What is the impact of cause-related marketing on the consumer's response in terms of attitude to the strategy, attitude toward the brand and purchase intention?  Do consumers respond more positively toward cause-related marketing than toward sponsorship or sales promotion? To address these questions, an experimental research design incorporating self-administered questionnaires was used.  The major finding of this research is that consumers may have a more favourable attitude to cause-related marketing than to either sponsorship or sales promotion, however the brand must be perceived to have a natural association or fit with the cause.  Further, cause-related marketing has the ability to engender a more favourable change in attitude to the brand than does sales promotion.  This change in attitude is affected by the consumer's attitude to the strategy itself.  This study did not, however, demonstrate that exposure to cause-related marketing, sponsorship or sales promotion had a significant effect on purchase intention.  Finally, neither gender nor personal values have been shown to influence the above outcomes.  The findings of this research have a number of practical implications for the effective use of cause-related marketing.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cause-related marketing</field><field name="subject">consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">consumers</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050211.124210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Olfactory Stem Cells From Adult Rats</field><field name="creator">Wetzig, Andrew R</field><field name="description">The formation of neurospheres was important in demonstrating that neurogenesis in the adult brain may be fuelled by a stem cell population. The olfactory mucosa is another site of neurogenesis which, in humans, has been observed to contain a stem cell population through the formation of neurospheres (Murrell et al., 2005). Stem cells can be defined as cells capable of self-renewal and multipotency. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of rat olfactory stem cells growing as neurospheres. The hypothesis is that the rat olfactory mucosa contains a 'true' stem cell population that can be cultured as neurospheres and that will demonstrate multipotency by differentiating into 'non-olfactory' cell types and possess the capacity for self-renewal, if provided with the appropriate environmental niche. Here it was found that adult rat olfactory mucosa is capable of generating neurospheres when cultured in EGF and bFGF. Evidence of self-renewal was provided by the formation of six generations of neurospheres, the formation of neurospheres from single cells and the expression of markers associated with self-renewal by neurosphere cells. The multipotency of olfactory neurosphere cells was demonstrated through manipulation of the stem cell niche. In defined culture conditions, extracellular matrix molecules and growth factors were able to induce the differentiation of neurosphere cells down the dopaminergic lineage pathway. When co-cultured with differentiating cells, neonatal myoblasts and 3T3-L1 cells, olfactory neurosphere cells were able to differentiate and incorporate into a skeletal muscle myotube and differentiate into adipocytes, respectively. In conclusion it was found that the adult rat olfactory mucosa is capable of generating neurospheres. When presented with an appropriate niche neurosphere cells are able to self-renew and demonstrate multipotency.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Olfactory stem cells</field><field name="subject">neurospheres</field><field name="subject">neurogenesis</field><field name="subject">multipotency</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070724.121953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Criteria for the Design and Evaluation of Technology Education Facilities: A Study Involving the Development and Trial of Appropriate Design Criteria</field><field name="creator">Wheeler, Brian James</field><field name="description">As education systems, in particular Technology Education, adapt to new expectations for secondary students entering an uncertain workforce, the time is appropriate to investigate the need for school facilities to meet these present demands and those that continue to change curricula. This study has been conducted in order to determine the facility requirements for the delivery of the evolving technology/manual arts curriculum in Queensland. A set of validated design criteria for evaluating technology education and vocational education settings was developed and trialed to assist the designer of such facilities to meet the needs of this area on schools designed in different eras from the 1 960s to the present. A review of the published literature would indicate that little has been written on this aspect of facilities design. While related studies have been conducted in North America, they were not confined to the designing of the facilities and only had specific relevance in that country. An expert group consisting of prominent Queensland educators provided the impetus for developing the criteria which had been generated through a systematic search of the literature. The methodology utilised to involve the expert group was the Nominal Group Technique. After the criteria had been developed, they were validated by questionnaire through a 30% random sample of practicing heads of department across Queensland in both state and independent systems. A trial evaluation using current facilities was subsequently conducted to determine the effectiveness of the criteria in terms of teacher acceptability as well as establishing a pattern of needs for modification. Practitioners who use the facility for teaching technology education and/or vocational education could use the set of criteria to evaluate their facility in a similar manner to that of evaluating their students. Such evaluations could then become the basis for ffiture school planning and budgetary allocations as well as asset management of existing facilities. The study proved to be valuable as the validated criteria have the potential of being used as a tool by teachers to evaluate their facilities. At the systems level of operation, the criteria will provide assistance for designers, architects and teachers to prepare informal educational briefs. Such briefs would provide a consistent approach to the some times difficult task of clearly defining the function of a facility. The modem facility must meet the needs of current curriculum and be sufficiently flexible and adaptable to provide the educational requirements well into the twenty-first century. These developed criteria will greatly assist in this process.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technology education</field><field name="subject">Nominal Group technique</field><field name="subject">education facilities</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">design criteria</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050906.132938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education and Training For Effective Environmental Advocacy</field><field name="creator">Whelan, James M.</field><field name="description">Research on environmental advocacy has tended to focus on outcomes and achievements rather than the processes through which these are achieved. In addition, minimal research has attended in detail to the complexity of environmental advocacy, or explored measures to through which to enhance advocates&#146; prospects of success. The environment movement itself has given scarce attention to promoting the skills, abilities and predispositions that contribute to effective advocacy. Indeed, most environmental non-government organisations (ENGOs) in Australia appear to believe that scientific or expert knowledge will be sufficient to influence environmental decision-makers and consequently provide minimal training or education to enhance advocacy. This thesis is a response to these problems. It seeks to develop an understanding of, and model for, activist education and training in the Australian environment movement.  The two main bodies of literature that inform the study are social movement and adult education literature. The former provides the context for the study. Social movement theorists present various explanations of how and why environmental activists work for change. These theorists also discuss the organisational structures and modes of operation typically adopted by activists. The second body of literature is utilised in this thesis to provide a synthesis of relevant educational orientations, traditions and practices. Popular, experiential and adult environmental education offer promising strategies for advocacy organisations that seek to enhance activists&#146; skills and abilities. The research questions posed in this study lie at the convergence of these two bodies of literature.  Two empirical studies were undertaken during this inquiry. The first was conducted with the Queensland Conservation Council, an environmental advocacy organisation where the researcher was employed for five years. The study drew on methods and techniques associated with ethnography and action research to identify, implement and evaluate a range of interventions which aimed to educate and train advocates. Three cycles of inquiry generated useful insights into environmental advocacy and identified useful strategies through which advocacy may be enhanced. The second study, a case study based on interviews and observation, explored the Heart Politics movement. The ethnographic research methods utilised in this case study resulted in a rich description and critical appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of Heart Politics gatherings as activist education. These two studies contributed to the development of a grounded and endogenous theory of education and training for environmental advocacy. This theory is based on a set of observations concerning the provision of activist education: (1) that most activist learning occurs informally and unintentionally through participation in social action such as environmental campaigns; (2) that this learning can be assessed according to a five-category framework and tends to favour specific categories including the development of social action and organisational development skills rather than alternative categories such as political analysis and personal development; (3) that this informal learning can be harnessed and enhanced through strategies which situate learning in the context of action and promote heightened awareness of the learning dimension of social action; and (4) that a key obstacle to education and training in the environment movement is a conspicuous lack of professional development or support for the people involved in facilitating and coordinating activist education activities and programs. These people are often volunteers and infrequently possess qualifications as educators or facilitators but are more likely to be seasoned activists. They tend to work in isolation as activist education activities are sporadic, geographically diffuse and ad hoc. These observations along with other insights acquired through participatory action research and ethnographic inquiry led to a set of conclusions, some of which have already been implemented or initiated during the course of this study. The first conclusion is that strategies to promote the professional development of activist educators may benefit from the development of texts tailored to the tactical orientations and political and other circumstances of Australian environmental advocacy groups. Texts, alone, are considered an inadequate response. The study also concludes that informal networks, formal and informal courses and other strategies to assist collaboration and peer learning among activist educators offer considerable benefits. Other conclusions pertain to the benefits of collaborating with adult educators and tertiary institutions, and professionals, to the relative merits of activist workshops and other forms of delivery, to the opportunities for activist training presented by regular environment movement gatherings and conferences and to the significant merits of promoting and supporting mentorship relationships between novice and experienced activists.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental advocacy</field><field name="subject">environmental activism</field><field name="subject">activists</field><field name="subject">Queensland Conservation Council</field><field name="subject">Heart Politics movement</field><field name="subject">social activism</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040526.140105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpersonal Communication and Appraisal : The Application of Cognitive Appraisal Theory to Difficult Communication at Work</field><field name="creator">Whicker, Leanne</field><field name="description">The program of research reported here was concerned with what makes difficult face-to-face communication in work settings difficult.  A framework for analysing this problem was developed by bringing together the disparate literatures of communications theory and cognitive appraisal theory. The framework identified the outcome of an instance of face-to-face communication at work as a function of features of the situation, the appraisal that the worker makes in the situation, and the response strategies selected for dealing with the situation.  The research program was directed to operationalising these constructs and studying their interrelationship. The first two studies reported in the thesis (Studies 1 and 2) revealed the types of communication encounters that are most difficult to manage at work, and offered insight into why these situations are difficult.  Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered and the quantitative data analysed using multidimensional scaling techniques.  The results provided a taxonomy of difficult communication situations in the workplace. The next two studies (Studies 3 and 4) focused on the development of measures of primary and secondary appraisal, and on a taxonomy of response strategies applicable to work settings. A new measure of primary appraisal was developed from qualitative data pertaining specifically to the domain of difficult communication contexts.  Principal components analysis was used in the development of the response strategies instrument. Study 5, the final study, reported the results of the application of cognitive appraisal theory to the context of difficult communication at work. In this study, the theory was applied to four difficult communication situations identified in Study 1, and the relationships among appraisal, response strategy, and outcome were investigated using principal components analysis and, subsequently, hierarchical regression analysis. The results indicated that, as the appraisal of the context varies, so too does the choice of response strategy, lending support to the transactional model. Appraisal contributes significantly to response strategy choice and to the outcome of the situation over and above that offered by response strategies alone. In addition, the findings revealed that appraisal of the situation differ across situations and according to the status of the other person in the encounter. The findings of the series of studies reported here point to the value of viewing difficult communication situations in the workplace in terms of the interrelated constructs of situations, appraisals, strategies rather than, as more commonly, in terms of characteristics of &#145;difficult&#146; persons.  Some situations are inherently more difficult than others, appraisals alter the difficulty level of situations, and the availability of response strategies influence outcome.  Appraisal is, however, a construct of central importance, in much the same way it is in the research context from which it was appropriated, viz stress research.  Appraisal contributes significantly to choice of response strategy and directly to outcome over an above the contribution of response strategy. The research program was not without its shortcomings, among them the reliance on retrospective reports of participants about their behaviour, and these need to be addressed in future research.  The findings as they stand do, however, point to more useful ways of conceptualising difficult situations at work and devising methods of intervention that will ensure better outcomes, in a significant area of life in the modern workplace.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">workplace communication</field><field name="subject">interpersonal communication</field><field name="subject">appraisal</field><field name="subject">cognitive appraisal theory</field><field name="subject">interpersonal conflict</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030808.150552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of Catalyst Particle Emissions From a Fluidized Catalytic Cracker Unit</field><field name="creator">Whitcombe, Joshua Matthew</field><field name="description">The control of particle emissions from an oil refinery is often difficult, due to changing operational conditions and the limited range of available treatment options. Excessive particle emissions have often been attributed start up problems with Fluidized Catalytic Cracker Units (FCCU) and little information is available regarding the exact composition and nature of these excessive emissions.  Due to the complex nature of a FCCU, it has in the past been difficult to identify and control emissions, without the use of expensive end of pipe technologies.  An Australian Oil Refinery, concerned with their catalyst emissions, sponsored this study of FCCU particle emissions.  Due to the industrial nature of the project, a holistic approach to the management of emissions was taken, instead of a detailed investigation of a single issue.  By looking at the broader range of issues, practical and useful outcomes can be achieved for the refinery.  Initially, detailed emissions samplings were conducted to investigate the degree of particle emissions under start up conditions.   Stack emissions were collected during a standard start up, and analysed to determine the particle size distribution and metal concentration of the emitted material. Three distinct stages of emissions were discovered, initially a high concentration of larger particles, followed by a peak in the very fine particles and finally a reduction of particle emissions to a more steady or normal operational state.  The variation in particle emissions was caused by operational conditions, hardware design and catalyst characteristics.  Fluctuations in the gas velocity through the system altered the ability of the cyclones to collect catalyst material. Also, the low bed level allowed air bypass to occur more readily, contributing to the increased emissions levels seen during the initial stage of the start up.  Reduced fluidity characteristics of the circulating catalyst also affected the diplegs operations, altering the collection efficiency of the cyclone.  During the loading of catalyst into the system, abraded material was quickly lost due to its particle size, contributing to fine particle emissions levels.  More importantly, thermal fracturing of catalyst particles occurred when the cold catalyst was fed into the hot regenerator.  Catalyst particles split causing the generation of large amounts of fine particle material, which is easily lost from the system.  This loading of catalyst directly linked to the period of high concentration of fine particles in the emissions stream.  It was found that metals, and in particular iron, calcium and silicon form a thick layer on the outside of the catalyst, with large irregular shaped metal ridges, forming along the surface of the particle.  These ridges reduce the fluidity of the catalyst, leading to potential disruptions in the regenerator. In addition to this, the metal rich ridges are preferentially removed via attrition, causing metal rich material to be emitted into the atmosphere.  To overcome these high particle emissions rates from the FCCU the refinery should only use calcinated catalyst to reduce the influence of thermal process and particle fracture and generation.  Although the calcinated catalyst can fracture when added to the system, it is far less than that obtained with uncalicinated catalyst.  To further reduce the risk of particle fracture due to thermal stresses the refinery should consider reducing the temperature gradients between the hot and cold catalyst.  Due to the economics involved with the regenerator, possible pre-warming of catalyst before addition into system is the preferred option.  This pre-heating of catalyst should also incorporate a controlled attrition stage to help remove the build up of metals on the surface of the particles whilst allowing this material to be collected before it can be released into the atmosphere.  The remove of the metal crust will also improve the fluidity of the system and reduce the chance of catalyst blockages occurring.  Finally, modelling of the system has shown that control of key parameters such as particle size and gas velocity are essential to the management of air emissions.  The refinery should look at adjusting start up procedures to remove fluctuations in these key parameters.  Also the refinery should be careful in using correlation found in the literature to predicted operational conditions in the system as these correlations are misleading when used under industrial situations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">particle emissions</field><field name="subject">particulate emissions</field><field name="subject">particulates</field><field name="subject">oil refineries</field><field name="subject">catalytic cracking</field><field name="subject">Fluidized Catalytic Cracker Units</field><field name="subject">FCCU</field><field name="subject">FCCUs</field><field name="subject">flue gases</field><field name="subject">stack gases</field><field name="subject">air pollution</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031003.152200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energetics of Mouse Papillary Muscle</field><field name="creator">Widen, Cecilia</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this Thesis was to characterise the energetic properties of the mouse papillary muscle as this preparation could become a useful model to study alterations of energetic aspects of cardiac pathologies and heart-focussed genetic changes. Measurements of resting and active metabolism of the papillary muscles were made in vitro using the myothermic technique. In the first study the mechanism underlying impaired contractility of post-ischaemic rat papillary muscle was investigated. The rat preparation is well established and was used to develop protocols and approaches that could later be used as the basis for studies with mouse papillary muscle. The muscles were exposed to simulated ischaemia for 60 min and change in energetics was studied 30 min into the reperfusion phase. The work output was reduced to 66 &#177; 3% of the pre-ischaemia value and the enthalpy output decreased to 71 &#177; 3% of pre-ischaemia value. However, there was no change in either initial, 19 &#177; 3%, or net mechanical efficiency, 9.0 &#177; 0.9%. These data, in combination with studies of Ca2+ handling, suggests that the reduced work output was caused by attachment of fewer cross-bridges in each twitch, but with no change in work generated by each cross-bridge. The following two studies involved characterisation of the energetics of the mouse papillary muscle and included measurements of resting and active metabolism. The resting metabolic rate varied with muscle size but the mean initial value was tilda 25 mW g-1 and the estimated steady value tilda 5 mW g-1 . The resting metabolic rate declined exponentially with time towards a steady value, with a time constant of 18 &#177; 2 min. There was no alteration in isometric force output during this time. The magnitude of resting metabolism depended inversely on muscle mass, more than doubled following a change in substrate from glucose to pyruvate and was increased 2.5-fold when the osmolarity of the bathing solution was increased by addition of 300 mM sucrose. Addition of 30 mM BDM affected neither the time course of the decline in metabolic rate nor the eventual steady value. The energy requirements associated with contractile activity were tilda7 mJ g-1 twitch-1 at a contraction frequency of 1 Hz. The enthalpy output was not affected by changing substrate from glucose to pyruvate but did decrease with an increase in temperature. The enthalpy output was partitioned into force-dependent and force-independent components using BDM to selectively inhibit cross-bridge cycling. The force-independent enthalpy output was 18.6 &#177; 1.9% of the initial enthalpy output. Muscle initial efficiency was &amp;tilda32% and net efficiency tilda 17% when shortening at a realistic velocity. The enthalpy output decreased with increased contraction frequency but was independent of shortening velocity. On the basis of these values, it was calculated that the twitch energetics were consistent with ATP splitting by half the cross-bridges and the pumping of one Ca 2+ into the SR for every three cross-bridge cycles. The lack of influence of shortening velocity on energy cost supports the idea that the amount of energy to be used is determined early in a twitch and is not greatly influenced by events that occur during the contraction. The suitability of the mouse papillary muscle as a model to study ischaemia and reperfusion damage was also assessed. This preparation is excellent for studying muscle specific changes in work and enthalpy output; however, due to the long-term instability and variability amongst preparations, the suitability of this preparation in prolonged experiments remains uncertain.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mouse papillary muscle</field><field name="subject">myothermic technique</field><field name="subject">ischaemia and reperfusion damage</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070228.121312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Text-Independent Speaker Recognition Using Source Based Features</field><field name="creator">Wildermoth, Brett Richard</field><field name="description">Speech signal is basically meant to carry the information about the linguistic message. But, it also contains the speaker-specific information. It is generated by acoustically exciting the cavities of the mouth and nose, and can be used to recognize (identify/verify) a person. This thesis deals with the speaker identification task; i.e., to find the identity of a person using his/her speech from a group of persons already enrolled during the training phase. Listeners use many audible cues in identifying speakers. These cues range from high level cues such as semantics and linguistics of the speech, to low level cues relating to the speaker's vocal tract and voice source characteristics. Generally, the vocal tract characteristics are modeled in modern day speaker identification systems by cepstral coefficients. Although, these coeficients are good at representing vocal tract information, they can be supplemented by using both pitch and voicing information. Pitch provides very important and useful information for identifying speakers. In the current speaker recognition systems, it is very rarely used as it cannot be reliably extracted, and is not always present in the speech signal. In this thesis, an attempt is made to utilize this pitch and voicing information for speaker identification. This thesis illustrates, through the use of a text-independent speaker identification system, the reasonable performance of the cepstral coefficients, achieving an identification error of 6%. Using pitch as a feature in a straight forward manner results in identification errors in the range of 86% to 94%, and this is not very helpful. The two main reasons why the direct use of pitch as a feature does not work for speaker recognition are listed below. First, the speech is not always periodic; only about half of the frames are voiced. Thus, pitch can not be estimated for half of the frames (i.e. for unvoiced frames). The problem is how to account for pitch information for the unvoiced frames during recognition phase. Second, the pitch estimation methods are not very reliable. They classify some of the frames unvoiced when they are really voiced. Also, they make pitch estimation errors (such as doubling or halving of pitch value depending on the method). In order to use pitch information for speaker recognition, we have to overcome these problems. We need a method which does not use the pitch value directly as feature and which should work for voiced as well as unvoiced frames in a reliable manner. We propose here a method which uses the autocorrelation function of the given frame to derive pitch-related features. We call these features the maximum autocorrelation value (MACV) features. These features can be extracted for voiced as well as unvoiced frames and do not suffer from the pitch doubling or halving type of pitch estimation errors. Using these MACV features along with the cepstral features, the speaker identification performance is improved by 45%.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speaker recognition systems</field><field name="subject">speaker identification systems</field><field name="subject">voice recognition</field><field name="subject">voice identification</field><field name="subject">vocal recognition</field><field name="subject">vocal identification</field><field name="subject">pitch</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040831.115646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Structural Model of Satisfaction and Brand Attitude in Hotels</field><field name="creator">Wilkins, Hugh Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the customer experience in hotels. The thesis evaluates the customer experience in relation to the antecedents of behavioural loyalty. Behavioural loyalty is evaluated in relation to customer satisfaction, brand trust and brand attitude. Customer satisfaction is also evaluated in relation to the antecedents of hotel performance, service quality and perceived value. The broad research underpinning this research is: How do consumers perceive and relate to luxury and first class hotel brands? The hotel industry is a large and highly diverse industry that includes a wide range of property styles, uses and qualities (Chon &amp; Sparrowe, 2000; Go &amp; Pine, 1995; Olsen, 1996; Powers &amp; Barrows, 1999).  The industry covers the spectrum of small, medium and large enterprises (Brotherton, 2003; Jones, 2002) and makes a significant contribution to national and international economies. The research incorporated data collection in three stages. The first stage was a qualitative study of consumers who self selected as first class or luxury consumers. The data from the focus groups were used to develop items for inclusion in a survey instrument. The focus groups data, together with information gathered from a literature review, were used to develop scales across a number of hotel performance dimensions. In addition scales were included in the survey instrument on customer satisfaction, perceived value, brand trust, brand attitude and behavioural loyalty. The second stage of the research was a pilot study with the survey instrument being distributed to a convenience sample. The data collected at this stage were used to purify and refine the survey instrument. The final stage was data collected from consumers in a number of Australian hotels. The resultant data set comprised 693 completed and useable responses. The data were examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to confirm the hotel performance and other dimensions. The resultant dimensions showed good psychometric properties. A number of hypotheses were proposed in the thesis and examined using structural equation modelling. Although two hypotheses were rejected the resultant structural model showed strong relationships between the dimensions included. The research identified that service quality is a strong contributor to behavioural loyalty.  The stronger pathway from service quality to behavioural loyalty was through customer satisfaction (  = 0.63) although the pathway through brand attitude (  = 0.22) was also significant.  Both customer satisfaction and service quality had a significant effect on brand trust and service quality also influenced brand attitude. A number of recommendations for further research were made.  These included the replication of this study in different geographic and industry contexts.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">hotel management</field><field name="subject">accommodation industry</field><field name="subject">hospitality industry</field><field name="subject">brand attitude</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061023.160143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adenosine and Ischaemia in Young To Aged Hearts</field><field name="creator">Willems, Laura E</field><field name="description">Ischaemic heart disease is a major contributor to premature death and heart failure in the Westernised world. Ischaemic injury within the heart may be beneficially modulated by the nucleoside adenosine. Derived from catabolism of ATP, adenosine was initially known as a potent bradycardic and hypotensive agent. However, more recently the protective function of adenosine has been investigated. The protective effects of adenosine are mediated via activation of adenosine receptors: A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors. Activation of these potentially protective (or retaliatory) adenosine receptors hinges upon accumulation of adenosine during ischaemia-reperfusion. This Thesis examines the role and mechanisms of adenosine mediated cardioprotection in young and aged hearts, exploring endogenous and exogenous adenosine receptor activation, genetic manipulation of A1 receptors and adenosine deaminase and pharmacological manipulation of adenosine metabolism. The effects of age on ischaemic responses and adenosine handling and protection are also assessed. The core approach to assess each of the above issues involved the Langendorff isolated mouse heart preparation. Experiments within Chapter 3 focuses on the contractile effects of adenosine receptors in normoxic hearts. This study indicates A2A receptors have no direct effect on contractility, while adenosine exerts positive inotropy independently of coronary flow and perfusion pressure (i.e. Independent of the Gregg phenomenon). In addition, investigations in genetically modified hearts hint at positive inotropy in response to A1 receptors. Since the latter is only evidenced in modified lines, it is possible A1-mediated inotropy may be abnormal or supraphysiological. In Chapter 4 the impact of genetic 'deletion' of A1ARs and/or adenosine deaminase (ADA) on intrinsic tolerance to ischaemia were studied. Data demonstrate that genetic deletion of A1 receptors significantly limits the ability of the mouse myocardium to withstand injury during ischaemic insult. Thus, providing strong support for a role of A1ARs in determining intrinsic tolerance to ischaemia-reperfusion. ADA KO mice confirm protection afforded by endogenous adenosine and the notion of adenosine metabolism modification as a protective strategy. Interestingly, effects of A1AR KO differ from A1AR overexpression or A1AR agonism in that the latter decrease contractile diastolic dysfunction while A1AR KO selectively increase systolic dysfunction and increase oncosis without altering diastolic injury. This challenges current dogma regarding the action of A1 adenosine receptors on ischaemic injury. In Chapter 5 the effects of adenosine metabolism inhibition (via adenosine deaminase (ADA) and adenosine kinase (AK) inhibitors) were studied. Inhibition of adenosine deaminase with the drug EHNA, and adenosine phosphorylation with iodotubercidin significantly protected mouse hearts from ischaemia-reperfusion, reducing contractile dysfunction and cardiac enzyme efflux. However, inhibitors failed to improve the outcome of the aged myocardium. 8-SPT and 5-HD reduced the protective effects of EHNA and iodotubercidin demonstrating thus; cardioprotection via ADA and AK appears to rely on adenosine receptor activation and involves a mitoK ATP dependent mechanism. Since aging is of considerable importance with regard to outcomes of ischaemic heart disease, experiments in Chapter 6 focused on effects of aging (and gender) on cardiovascular function and injury during ischaemia-reperfusion. In assessing post ischaemic outcomes in hearts from young adult (2-4 months), mature adult (8 months), middle aged (12 months), aged (18 months) and senescent (24-28 months) C57/BL/6J mice, data reveal a substantial age-related decline in ischaemic tolerance (which appears selective for myocardial vs. vascular injury). The decline in ischaemic tolerance is expressed primarily within the initial 12 months in both males and females with relatively little further decline with continued aging. There is evidence of a modest improvement in tolerance in senescence vs. aged hearts possibly reflecting selection of a protected phenotype in senescent populations. In addition, mature and middle-aged female hearts showed improved tolerance to ischaemia-reperfusion compared to males, supporting a role for hormonal changes. Effects of aging and purine metabolism were studied in Chapter 7. Data suggest impaired tolerance to ischaemia-reperfusion in older hearts may stem in part from shifts in myocardial purine catabolism. Data reveal reduced accumulation of salvageable and cardioprotective adenosine and enhanced accumulation of poorly salvaged (and potentially injurious) hypoxanthine and xanthine. These changes may potentially predispose the aged myocardium to ischaemic injury and radical generation via the xanthine oxidase reaction. The final data Chapter of this Thesis describes preliminary data regarding aging, signalling and adenosine mediated protection. It was found that protein kinase C (PKC) and A1 receptors mediate protection in young hearts and also that A1 receptors appear to mediate protection via a PKC LindependentLi signalling cascade. In addition, experiments in aged hearts (attempting to elucidate mechanisms behind impaired adenosinergic protection with age) suggest a PKC-independent A1-mediated protection path may be preserved with aging, since A1 receptors continue to offer some protection while PKC activation does not. It is possible the failure of exogenous adenosine to offer protection in aged hearts may result from a lesion at or downstream of PKC.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ischaemia</field><field name="subject">adenosine</field><field name="subject">ischaemic heart disease</field><field name="subject">adenosine mediated cardioprotection</field><field name="subject">ischaemia-reperfusion</field><field name="subject">adenosine deaminase</field><field name="subject">adenosine kinase</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061011.163451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Doing Environment Business With China Through Cross-Cultural Networks: A Dynamic Model for Small-to-Medium Australian Enterprises</field><field name="creator">Williams, Donna Clare</field><field name="description">The research is a critical analysis of the operational aspects of doing environment business with China through cross-cultural networks. In particular the investigation involved establishing an intensively documented, longitudinal profile of a single network. This network comprised Australian Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and Chinese players based in the People's Republic of China. This profile covers a period of two decades. The research adopted a broad multi-disciplinary and inductive approach, using action research, case study methods, and systems analysis techniques. An innovative approach used time values as a constant to analyse the relativity of player connections, activities and structural levels in the network. This approach drew its applied orientation from the environmental sciences, and its theoretical base from the social science disciplines of marketing and international business. The specific field of study was the structure and evolutionary dynamics of networks. The outcome of the research is a model Australian SMEs can use for doing environment business with China. This model sets environment business in the context of a wider trading network of Chinese, Australian, South East Asian, and Middle Eastern players. The cornerstone of this model is the corporate role of the academic sector in accessing the Chinese environmental market. The research shows in detail how Australian SMEs can, and do, use cross-cultural academic linkages for trade. Such linkages facilitate market research, negotiation, risk management, product development, and the establishment of distribution channels in Asian markets. The study also demonstrates the importance of using a number of parallel nets of Chinese players to facilitate trade and overcome interruptions or obstacles. The research has contributed to knowledge by establishing an Asia-oriented, empirically derived model that differs substantially from the mono-cultural models in current practice in the Australian environment industry. The intensive investigation of the network of SMEs and Chinese players has identified the entrepreneurial strengths of SMEs in the international marketplace. This finding contrasts with the prevailing view that SMEs must depend on larger players for export success. In addition, the research has established that this kind of network has a clan-like structure. This finding is central to the model. The research demonstrates that a clan-like structure is a flexible framework that is compatible with the independence and capacity of small firms to adapt to change and to make decisions. This characteristic of SMEs enables them to proceed without, and at times in spite of, the encumbrances of large and unwieldy corporate and institutional structures. This finding is directly contrary to the belief prevalent in the Australian environment industry that SMEs depend on larger players to enter international markets. The finding also challenges the established view that Chinese networks are relatively closed systems based on family ties. The research shows that Australian SMEs can become part of these systems either directly or through links, and have many common attributes with their Chinese counterparts. The research has made a key contribution to theory by using these findings to develop an organic network model that differs from the so-called contrived network. This empirically derived theoretical model represents the seven dimensions of cross-cultural collaboration. The four social dimensions are the personal, organisational, sectoral and regional levels of a person-centred network, composed of nets of individuals with extensive linkages to other individuals and to organisations. The three dynamic dimensions are the triadic, the temporal, and the trading levels of interaction between the players. This theoretical model also demonstrates the depth of cross-connection between the nets of individual, and the embeddedness of the network in other networks. The model emphasises the centrality of time as the key connector between the social dimensions of the network and the exchange processes that characterise clan-like interactions. The model also represents the layers of evolutionary development that characterise the exchange processes in the network. These layers include adaptive processes, short-term exchanges, and long-term exchanges, and exchanges that derive from particular arrangements of players and market openings at critical points in time. This model extends concepts that have emerged from the original International Industrial  Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) Interaction Model, and gives empirical credence to recent philosophical, but untested, views on the relevance of time as a context for interaction.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental science</field><field name="subject">environmental business</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural networks</field><field name="subject">Australia and China</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060313.140417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A 'Journey Of Her Own'?: The Impact Of Constraints On Women's Solo Travel</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Erica Christine</field><field name="description">Women are increasingly active in the participation and consumption of travel, and are now recognised as a growing force within the tourism industry.  This trend is linked to changing social and political circumstances for Western women around the world.  Within Australia specifically, women's opportunities for education and for earning equitable incomes through employment have improved.  Furthermore, traditional ideologies of the family have shifted, so that social expectations of marriage and the production of children do not yield as much power as they once did.  As a result of these shifts, women living in contemporary Australia have a wider range of resources and opportunities with which to access an ever-increasing array of leisure/travel choices. It appears that one of the many ways in which women have been exercising their relatively recent financial and social autonomy is through independent travel.  The solo woman traveller represents a growing market segment, with research showing that increasing numbers of females are choosing to travel alone, without the assistance or company of partners, husbands or packaged tour groups.  However, little empirical research has explored the touristic experiences of solo women travellers, or examined the constraints and challenges they may face when journeying alone. 'Constraints' have been described variously as factors which hinder one's ability to participate in desired leisure activities, to spend more time in those activities, or to attain anticipated levels of satisfaction and benefit.  While the investigation of constraints has contributed to the leisure studies discipline for a number of decades, the exploration of their influence on tourist behaviour and the tourist experience has been virtually overlooked.  Research has shown that despite the choices and opportunities women have today, the freedom they have to consume those choices, and to access satisfying leisure and travel experiences, may be constrained by their social and gendered location as females.  Although theorisations of constraint have remained largely in the field of leisure studies, it is argued and demonstrated in this thesis that there is potential in extending constraints theory to the inquiry of the tourist experience.  Grounded in theoretical frameworks offered by gender studies, feminist geography, sociology and leisure, this qualitative study set out to explore the impact of constraints on women's solo travel experiences.  Forty in-depth interviews were held with Australian women who had travelled solo at some stage of their adult lives.  Adopting an interpretive and feminist-influenced research paradigm, it was important to allow the women to speak of their lives, constraints and experiences in their own voices and on their own terms.  In line with qualitative methodologies, it is these women's words which form the data for this study.  Based on a 'grounded' approach to data analysis, the results reveal that constraints do exist and exert influence on these women's lives and travel experiences in a myriad of ways.  Four inter-linking categories of constraint were identified, namely socio-cultural, personal, practical and spatial.  Further definition of these categories evolved, depending on where the women were situated in their stage of the solo travel experience (that is, pre-travel or during-travel).  The results of this study show that there are identifiable and very real constraints facing solo women travellers.  These constraints could stem from the contexts of their home environments, or from the socio-cultural structures of the destinations through which they travelled.  However, these constraints were not immutable, insurmountable or even necessarily consciously recognised by many of the women interviewed.  In fact, it became increasingly evident that women were findings ways and means to 'negotiate' their constraints, challenges and limitations.  Three dominant negotiation responses to constraint could be identified; the women could choose to seek access to solo travel when faced with pre-travel constraints: they could withdraw from solo travel because of those same constraints, or they could decide to continue their journeys as a result of their in-situ constraints. Evidence of women negotiating suggests that constraints are not insurmountable barriers, and confirms that constraints do not necessarily foreclose access to travel.  Furthermore, a focus on negotiation re-positions women as active agents in determining the course of their lives and the enjoyment of their solo travel experiences, rather than as passive acceptors of circumstance and constraint.  Linking with the concept of negotiation, solo travel was also shown to be a site of resistance, freedom and empowerment for these forty women.  Through solo travel, it was apparent that the women could transgress the structures and roles which influenced and governed their lives. This thesis shows that, through solo travel, the women interviewed found an autonomous and self-determining 'journey of their own'.  At the same time, the extent to which this really was a journey of their own was questioned and revealed to be problematic under a feminist/gendered lens.  Thus a more appropriate concept of women's solo travel is that it is a 'relative escape'.  That is, their journeys, escapes and experiences were always situated relative to the societal expectations and perceptions of home; relative to the gendered perceptions and ideologies of the destination, and relative to the limited spatial freedoms as a result of a socially constructed geography of fear.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women travellers</field><field name="subject">travelers</field><field name="subject">solo travel</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">gender studies</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">feminist geography</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050209.110742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plane Wave Propagation Problems in Electrically Anisotropic and Inhomogeneous Media with Geophysical Applications</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Glenn Andrew</field><field name="description">Boundary value problems required for modelling plane wave propagation in electrically anisotropic and inhomogeneous media relevant to the surface impedance methods in electromagnetic geophysics are formally posed and treated. For a homogeneous TM-type wave propagating in a half space with both vertical and horizontal inhomogeneities where the TM-type wave is aligned with one of the elements of the conductivity tensor, it is shown using exact solutions that the shearing term in the homogeneous Helmholtz equation for inclined anisotropic media: [Equation 1],  unequivocally vanishes and solutions need only be sought to the homogeneous Helmholtz equation for biaxial media: [Equation 2]. This implies that those problems posed with an inclined uniaxial conductivity tensor can be identically stated with a fundamental biaxial conductivity tensor, provided that the conductivity values are the reciprocal of the diagonal terms from the Euler rotated resistivity tensor: [Equation 3], [Equation 4], [Equation 5]. The applications of this consequence for numerical methods of solving arbitrary two-dimensional problems for a homogeneous TM-type wave is that they need only to approximate the homogeneous Helmholtz equation and neglect the corresponding shearing term. The self-consistent impedance method, a two-dimensional finite-difference approximation based on a network analogy, is demonstrated to accurately solve for problems with inclined uniaxial anisotropy using the fundamental biaxial anisotropy equivalence.  The problem of a homogeneous plane wave at skew incidence upon an inclined anisotropic half space is then formally treated. In the half space, both TM- and TE-type waves are coupled and the linearly polarised incident TM- and TE-type waves reflect TE- and TM-type components. Equations for all elements of the impedance tensor are derived for both TM- and TE-type incidence. This offers potential as a method of predicting the direction of anisotropic strike from tensor impedance measurements in sedimentary environments.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical anisotropy</field><field name="subject">electromagnetic geophysics</field><field name="subject">numerical techniques</field><field name="subject">analytical techniques</field><field name="subject">surface impedance</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030325.210206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High Frequency Transformer for Switching Mode Power Supplies</field><field name="creator">Wong, Fu Keung</field><field name="description">A power supply is an essential part of all electronic devices. A switching mode power supply is a light weight power solution for most modern electronic equipment. The high frequency transformer is the backbone of modern switched mode power supplies. The skin effect and proximity effects are major problems in high frequency transformer design, because of induced eddy currents. These effects can result in transformers being destroyed and losing their power transferring function at high frequencies. Therefore, eddy currents are unwanted currents in high frequency transformers. Leakage inductance and the unbalanced magnetic flux distribution are two further obstacles for the development of high frequency transformers. Winding structures of power transformers are also a critical part of transformer design and manufacture, especially for high frequency applications. A new planar transformer with a helical winding structure has been designed and can maintain the advantages of existing planar transformers and significantly reduce the eddy currents in the windings. The maximum eddy current density can be reduced to 27% of the density of the planar transformer with meander type winding structure and 33% of the density of the transformer with circular spiral winding structure at an operating frequency of 1MHz. The voltage ratio of the transformer with helical winding structure is effectively improved to 150% of the voltage ratio of the planar transformer with circular spiral coils. With the evenly distributed magnetic flux around the winding, the planar transformer with helical winding structure is excellent for high frequency switching mode power supplies in the 21st Century.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">power supply</field><field name="subject">switched mode power supply</field><field name="subject">switching mode power supply</field><field name="subject">microelectronics</field><field name="subject">high frequency transformers</field><field name="subject">planar transformers</field><field name="subject">eddy currents</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050211.110915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite Element Analysis and Improvement of Impeller Blade Geometry</field><field name="creator">Wong, Vui-Hong</field><field name="description">Stratification of water in large reservoirs occurs in summer, or at anytime in hot climates where the water surface is exposed long-term to sunlight and the water surface is heated.  Natural mixing will not occur due to the cooler and denser water always staying at the lower levels.  Therefore, mechanical circulators are designed to prevent water quality problems related to stratification and depletion of dissolved oxygen.  Impellers that produce the flow in mechanical circulators are available in different sizes and these impellers are designed to produce different flow rates.  Due to hydraulic loadings, impellers have to be strong and durable.  Loadings on impellers depend on their geometries and therefore, a durable impeller is a good combination of the use of correct materials and good geometry. Long and slender impellers are prone to failure when subjected to high hydrodynamic loadings.  Nowadays, designers have very limited information on predicting the stresses on impellers and the deflection patterns of impellers because there are no design rules in designing these impeller blades and there is no such thing as "best geometry".  A good impeller blade design is by guesswork and experience.  In order to design the geometry that suits this application, trial-and-error finite element analyses have been conducted in this project to minimize stress levels on the blades. This research involves the use of finite element analysis (FEA) to predict stress and deflection of impeller blades used on large (5m diameter) ducted axial flow impellers as the first step in the design process.  Then, based on the results, improvements have been done to the models until the final design was made.  As far as the author has been able to determine, this has not been researched before.  Finite Element Analysis has been used on wind turbine blades, rudders and hulls of boats but not on axial flow impeller blades of the type used in this project. For the purpose of this project, commercial finite element computer program packages STRAND6 and STRAND7 were used as the main analysis tools.  A static line load increasing linearly with radius along the blade has been used to simulate the assumed hydrodynamic loading, and applied to all FEA blade models.  The analysis results proved the stresses on blades are largely dependant on the blade geometry.  From the analysis results, the author modified the stacking arrangement of the FEA elements in order to minimize both the tensile stresses and the displacements of the blades at the tip.  Parametric studies have been done in order to obtain the best FEA impeller blade model.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water stratification</field><field name="subject">water temperature</field><field name="subject">reservoirs</field><field name="subject">impellers</field><field name="subject">axial flow impeller blades</field><field name="subject">finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">loading</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030825.150853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods For Understanding Bacterial Metabolic Activity In Activated Sludge</field><field name="creator">Wos, Melissa Louise</field><field name="description">Biological wastewater treatment relies on the diverse and complex metabolic activities of bacteria to remove pollutants. Its success depends on the metabolic efficiency of the bacteria. Activated sludge models use parameters that attempt to depict bacterial growth and metabolic processes. However, current methods do not separate metabolic activity from growth and maintenance. As a result, activated sludge processes are misinterpreted or over-simplified. Alternative methods for gauging bacterial activity have been proposed and include the measurements of cellular derived compounds that relate specifically to energy cycling and include Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide [NADH]. To date, NADH has been largely measured within activated sludge using commercial online fluorimeters with in situ probes. However, this current method provides a measure of the 'bulk' (raw) fluorescence within the system, resulting in difficulties when interpreting fluorescence data and poor sensitivity for detecting changes in intracellular [NADH]. This study has developed a more reliable method for estimating intracellular [NADH] and thus metabolic activity within activated sludge systems. Separating extracellular from intracellular [NADH] in samples was crucial because NADH was released and accumulates in the extracellular environment at a concentration of 200 ~M immediately following bacterial death or lysis. This concentration did not decline overtime. This not only caused high background fluorescence but also reduced the sensitivity of detection for changes in intracellular [NADH]. In particular, considerably higher [NADH] values to those from the extracellular suspensions were obtained following extraction of the intracellular material, suggesting that the cell membranes were not being penetrated by the excitable light source. Of the extraction procedures examined, filtration followed by extraction of the intracellular material with a hot Tris buffer was the most efficient and was recommended for accurate estimates of intracellular [NADH] in situ. In addition, standards were used to quantify NADH (moles per cell and/or unit volume) from unknown samples. The limits of detection were found to be 1.058 - 353 uM, whereas concentrations above 353 jAM self-quenched. Sample concentrations were always within these limits of detection. Hence, the sensitivity, reliability and experimental application of the original method was improved upon and able to be used for the direct measurement of microbial metabolic activity, something that has not been demonstrated before now. This study found that bacteria have between 106~ I 08 NADH molecules per cell depending on their metabolic state. A highly metabolically active bacterial cell had between 1O6~ tO7 NADH molecules, while a less active bacterial cell had between to7 -to8 NADH molecules. These measurements of metabolic activity were simultaneously monitored alongside other measures of bacterial growth, such as the incorporation of radiolabelled thymidine into DNA as a direct measure of DNA replication (new cell synthesis), the incorporation of radiolabelled leucine into protein as a direct measure of protein synthesis, oxygen uptake rates (OUR) as a direct measure of respiration, ATP as a measure of potential energy and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a measure of substrate assimilation. As OUR deceased, bacterial growth (using both the thymidine and leucine assays), specific [NADH] and specific [ATP] increased. High OUR and substrate oxidation rates simultaneous with low specific [NADH] indicated high rates of electron transport and thus efficient metabolic activity. Also, low OUR and substrate oxidation rates simultaneous with high specific [NADHI indicated inefficient rates of electron transport, therefore inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation (ATP production). A lack of oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor did not efficiently reoxidise NADH to NAD and resulted in an accumulation of NADH within the cell. Thus, a measure of low specific [NADHI was linked to the efficient rate of reoxidation of NADH to NAD* and reflects high metabolic efficiency. DNA and protein syntheses were coupled following substrate enrichment (glucose or acetate), indicating that bacteria were in balanced growth. However, DNA and protein syntheses became uncoupled once substrate was depleted, indicating unbalanced growth. An average Leu:TdR ratio of 7.4 was determined for activated sludge and was comparable to values published from marine systems. This ratio increased during log growth phase and decreased during stationary growth phases. Specific growth rates determined using the [3HITdR and [3H]Leu assay yielded values ranging from 2 - 10.5 d' and from 2.5 - 6 d1, respectively and were comparable to published values. Changes in OUR, NADH, ATE', DNA replication and protein synthesis were statistically ordinated using multidimensional scaling, and changes (in magnitude and direction) in bacterial metabolic activity were observed. Such methods enable the tracing of where bacteria divert their energies, such as to growth or maintenance and thus provide a greater understanding of bacterial behaviour in activated sludge. While studying anoxic and anaerobic conditions were beyond the scope of this work, the use of such methods to monitor bacterial metabolic activity under such conditions is warranted.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bacterial metabolic activity</field><field name="subject">activated sludge</field><field name="subject">biological wastewater treatment</field><field name="subject">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide</field><field name="subject">NADH molecules</field><field name="subject">oxygen uptake rates</field><field name="subject">disolved organic carbon</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061031.151641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensory Processing in Dyslexic Children</field><field name="creator">Wright, Craig</field><field name="description">This study tested the prediction that a group of dyslexic children (n = 70) would be less sensitive to auditory and visual temporal stimuli than a control group (n = 52).  In the auditory domain, detection thresholds for 2 Hz FM, 2 Hz AM and 20 Hz AM were assessed.  The modulations in these stimuli are detected on the basis of temporal cues.  In contrast, the modulations in the control stimulus 240 Hz FM modulate too rapidly to be detected with temporal cues.  The dyslexic group were significantly less sensitive than the control group to the temporal and non-temporal measures at initial testing (Phase 1) and again nine months later (Phase 4).  These data demonstrated that the auditory deficit in the dyslexic group was more general in nature than had previously been suggested.  In the visual domain, sensitivity to global coherent motion was assessed.  The dyslexic group were significantly less sensitive than the control group on this measure at both phases of the study. Despite the overall between group differences, the magnitude of the effects were low to moderate.  There was also substantial overlap between the performance of the two groups on the sensory processing measures.  A deviance analysis was conducted to determine the proportion of dyslexic individuals who had sensory processing deficits.  When data from each phase was examined separately, the incidence of sensory processing deficits in the dyslexic group was comparable to previous studies.  However, when the data from both phases was combined, only 5-18% of the dyslexic group had impairments on any of the sensory tasks that were stable across time.  Nevertheless, these results do not preclude sensory processing making a contribution to reading difficulties in some children.  When the relationship between sensory processing thresholds and reading ability was considered, sensitivity to auditory and visual temporal measures accounted for significant unique variance in phonological processing, orthographic coding and overall reading skill, even after accounting for IQ and vigilance. This study was also tested the prediction that visual attention can explain the link between visual temporal processing and reading.  Vidyasagar (1999) proposed that the magnocellular (M) system, which processes temporal stimuli (e.g., motion), is also important for efficient functioning of an attentional spotlight.  This spotlight is proposed to arise in parietal cortex (a major endpoint of the M system), and is involved in highlighting areas for detailed visual processing when performing visual tasks, such as visual search or reading.  It was predicted that only those dyslexic participants with motion detection impairments would also be impaired on a serial search task that required the attentional spotlight.  On average, the dyslexic group had significantly slower serial search than the control group.  However, the magnitude of effect was small and a deviance analysis demonstrated that only 8.5% of the dyslexic group had stable impairments relative to the control group.  Furthermore, only one of the six dyslexic participants with a visual attention impairment had a co-existing deficit in detecting coherent motion.  Thus, visual attention deficits of this type appear to exist independently of coherent motion deficits. This study also provided important evidence on the reliability of measurement for the sensory processing tasks.  The data showed that the test-retest reliability of the sensory measures was only moderate over a nine month period.  Test-retest for other cognitive measures over the same time frame was high - including that for an orthographic coding task, which had similar procedure and task demands to the sensory measures.  The results also demonstrated that a high proportion of participants in both groups performed inconsistently across time (i.e., they had a threshold indicative of a deficit at one phase and performance within normal limits at the other).  Up to 32% of the dyslexic group and 19% of the control group had inconsistent performance on the sensory measures across time.  The importance of developing more reliable methods of estimating sensory sensitivity is discussed, as is the need for normative data on sensory processing tasks in order to more accurately make decisions about the incidence of sensory deficits.  In summary, this study provided evidence for a relationship between sensory processing and reading.  However, the current data demonstrated that sensory processing deficits are not characteristic of all dyslexic individuals.  Future research should focus on explaining why only a sub-group of dyslexics have sensory deficits, and also why some control participants have deficits.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dyslexic children</field><field name="subject">sensory processing</field><field name="subject">cognitive learning</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061018.153411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leveraging Single-User Applications for Multi-User Collaboration</field><field name="creator">Xia, Qian</field><field name="description">People rely on off-the-shelf commercial single-user software systems in their daily lives and work to perform single-user tasks. People also need groupware systems to perform collaborative or group tasks. The goal of this thesis work is to develop innovative techniques for building computer applications that combine conventional single-user functionalities with advanced collaboration capabilities to effectively support people's individual and group work. This thesis work contributes an innovative Transparent Adaptation (TA) approach and associated supporting techniques that can be used to convert existing or new single-user applications into real-time multi-user collaborative versions without changing their source code. The transparently adapted collaborative systems not only support unconstrained collaboration and other collaboration features that were previously seen only in advanced groupware research prototypes, but also maintain the conventional functionalities and interface features that were previously seen only in commercial off-the-shelf single-user applications. Major technical contributions of the TA approach include techniques for adapting the single-user application programming interface to the data and operation models of the underlying generic collaboration technique and a generic system architecture for collaborative systems. The Operation Transformation (OT) technique has been chosen as the underlying collaboration technique for the TA approach due to its capability of supporting unconstrained collaboration and application independence. This thesis work has also made important contributions to OT by extending OT from supporting only collaborative plain text editing to supporting collaboration on complex data structures and comprehensive functionalities. To support the adaptation of complex data and operation models in a range of applications, this thesis work has contributed a package of advanced adaptation techniques for collaborative table editing and graphic object grouping. These techniques have not only increased the capability of TA, but have also advanced the state-of-the-art of collaborative editing techniques. To facilitate natural and smooth collaboration, this thesis work has contributed a multi-functional workspace awareness framework which is able to reduce the effort for developing workspace awareness features, and to be extended to support new workspace awareness features. Most importantly, this framework is able to deliver correct and precise workspace awareness information in the face of dynamic content and view changes in TA-based systems, which is an innovative feature unavailable in existing techniques. The TA approach and supporting techniques were developed and tested in the process of transparently converting two commercial off-the-shelf single-user applications - Microsoft Word and PowerPoint - into real-time collaborative applications, called CoWord and CoPowerPoint, respectively. CoWord and CoPowerPoint not only retain the functionalities and the 'look-and-feel' of their single-user counterparts, but also provide advanced multi-user collaboration capabilities for supporting multiple interaction paradigms, ranging from concurrent and free interaction to sequential and synchronized interaction, and for supporting detailed workspace awareness, including multi-user tele-pointers and radar views. The TA-based collaborative system architecture and the generic collaboration engine software component developed from this work can be reused in adapting a wide range of single-user applications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Single-user software</field><field name="subject">groupware systems</field><field name="subject">transparent adaptation</field><field name="subject">operation transformation</field><field name="subject">CoWord</field><field name="subject">CoPowerPoint</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070216.093300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrogen Cycling in Leucaena Alley Cropping</field><field name="creator">Xu, Zhihong</field><field name="description">Field experiments were conducted on an Alfisol in the semi-arid tropics of northern Australia to investigate nitrogen (N) cycling in the leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) alley cropping system. This is a farming system in which maize (Zea mays L.) is grown in alleys formed by leucaena hedgerows spaced 4.5 metres apart. Mineralization of N from Ieucaena (prunings) and maize residues was studied under field conditions. Response of maize growth to addition of N fertilizer and plant residues was evaluated both in field plot and microplot experiments. The fate of fertilizer N and leucaena N was examined over four consecutive seasons. The decomposition (loss of mass) of dry, cut 15N-labelled leucaena residues differed from that of intact fresh leucaena prunings in the first cropping season although no difference was detected after one year. At the end of one cropping season, 3 months after application, 58-72% of 15N-labelled leucaena had decomposed compared to only 34-36% of fresh leucaena prunings. Similar trends occurred at 20 and 52 days after application. The extent of decomposition of fresh leucaena prunings (28-33%) was similar at two loading rates (2.4 and 4.7 t DM ha -1) by 3 months after addition. About 72% of young 15N labelled maize residues was decomposed by 3 months after addition in the presence of fresh leucaena prunings. Decomposition of 15N-labelled leucaena residues and unlabelled fresh prunings was 91% and 88% respectively 14 months after addition. After 2 years the corresponding values were 96% and 94%. When N content of the recovered residues was taken into account, the values were 95% and 94% after 14 months, and the same (97%) after 2 years. Maize yield and N uptake were significantly increased following addition of either unlabelled fresh leucaena residues or 15N-labelled thy Ieucaena residues. Application of N ferilizer produced a thither increase in the presence of the residues. The maize yield and N uptake with the 15N-labelled leucaena were not different from those with the unlabelled residues. There was a significant positive interaction between N fertilizer and leucaena prunings which increased maize production. Addition of maize residues decreased the yield and N uptake of maize compared with that obtained in the presence of N fertilizer at 40 kg N ha~1 and leucaena residues (2.4 t DM ha-1). There was a marked residual benefit of N fertilizer applied in the first season at 36 kgN hat in the presence of leucaena prunings on the second maize crop yield and N uptake, but not on the third crop. However, a significant residual benefit of leucaena prunings added in the first season was found in DM yield and N uptake of the second and third maize crop. The short-term fate of 15N applied in plant residues was examined during two separate cropping seasons. By 20 days after application of separate 15N-labelled leucaena leaves, stems and petioles, 3-9% of the added 15N could be found in maize plants, 33-49% was in surface residues, 36-48% in the 2 m soil proffle and 0.3-22% unaccounted for. In a separate experiment when leucaena components were not separated, 5% of 15N applied in leucaena residues was taken up by maize 52 days after addition, 45% was in residues, 25% was in soil and 25% was unaccounted for. Jn another experiment, maize recovered 6% of added leucaena 15N after 2 months, 39% remained in residues, 28% was in soil and 27% was not recovered. Incorporation of 15N-labelled leucaena residues in the soil did not increase recoveiy of leucaena 15N by maize compared with placement of the residues on the soil surface. By the end of one cropping season (3 months after application), 9% of added 15N was recovered by maize from 15N-labelled leucaena. There was a similar 15N recoveiy from 15N-labelled maize residues applied as mulch at 1.7 t DM ha1 together with unlabelled leucaena prunings at 2.4 t DM ha ~. In both cases, 30-32% of added 15N was detected in soil, 28% in residues, and 31-34% apparently lost. The short-term fate of fertilizer 15N was different from that of 15N added in plant residues. In a 52-day experiment, maize recovered 65-79% of fertilizer 15N applied at low rates (6.1 and 12.2 kg N ha -1) in the presence of leucaena prunings, 21-34% was present in soil, and less than 1% was not recovered. By 2 months after application, recoveiy of fertilizer 15N by maize was 41% from N fertilizer added at 80 kg N ha -1, 35% from N fertilizer at 40 kg N ha -1 in the presence of leucaena prunings, and 24% from N fertilizer at 40 kg N ha -1 in the presence of maize residues and leucaena prunings. The corresponding deficits (unaccounted-for 15N) were 37%, 38% and 47% respectively. A small but significant amount of the fertilizer 15N was present in the unlabelled leucaena residues (3%) and in the mixture of unlabelled leucaena and maize residues (7%) present on the soil surface. However, application of the plant residues did not affect recoveiy of the fertilizer 15N in soil (21-24%). When N fertilizer was applied at 40 kg N hi1 in the presence of leucaena prunings, 43% of fertilizer 15N was recovered by maize at the end of cropping season, 20% in soil, 2% in residues, and 35% unaccounted for. The long-term fate of fertilizer 15N was compared with that of leucaena 15N in an experiment over four cropping seasons. In the first season, maize tops recovered 50% of the fertilizer 15N but only 4% of the leucaena 15N. In the second, third and fourth seasons, maize (tops + roots) recovered 0.7%, 0.4% and 0.3% of the initial fertilizer 15N compared with 2.6%, 1.8% and 1.4% of the initial leucaena 15N. In the second, third and fourth seasons, recovery of the initial fertilizer 15N (12-14%) in soil was much lower than that of the initial leucaena 15N (38-40%). There was no further loss of the fertilizer 15N after the first season. However, the cumulative 15N deficit for the leucaena 1N in the first two seasons was 50%--thissuggested an additional loss of 23% since the end of the first season. There was no further loss of 15N from either residual fertilizer 15N or residual leucaena 15N in the third and fourth seasons. In conclusion, application of leucaena prunings could substantially increase maize yield and N uptake although some supplementary N fertilizer may be required to achieve maximum crop yield. Maize recovered only a small amount of added leucaena N in the first year. Most of the leucaena residue N was present in the soil and remaining residues after one season. This residue N would be gradually available for plant uptake by subsequent crops. Of course, annual additions of leucaena prunings would appreciably increase the pool of available N over time. Thus, application of leucaena prunings could substantially improve soil fertility in the long term.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nitrogen cycling</field><field name="subject">leucaena</field><field name="subject">alfisol</field><field name="subject">Zea mays L.</field><field name="subject">maize yield</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050906.155955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Settlemnet Stress and Health Needs of Migrant Women From the People's Republic of China in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Yan, Ru</field><field name="description">The late 1980s saw the onset of a rapid expansion of Chinese immigration into Australia. While this influx of Chinese migrants has produced a proliferation of research on the more affluent migrants from Hong Kong and Taiwan, studies on migrants especially women from the People's Republic of China (PRC) have remained few and far between.  Among those few studies on PRC-born migrant women, all of them identified settlement stress and its health implications as a major concern among PRC-born migrant, yet there has been little concerted effort on why this is the case, particularly in the area of health needs and solutions. Considering the increasing presence of PRC-born migrant women in Australia, there is a clear need for a comprehensive in-depth investigation into their settlement stress, to address their social and health needs and to provide solutions. This study aims to examine in-depth the PRC-born migrant women's settlement experience in Brisbane, focusing especially on their stress, social and health needs. This study employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. Since this study paid more attention to these migrant women's own life experiences, it is mainly a qualitative one, using informant interview, focus group and in-depth interviews to explore how best their stress could be alleviated. Quantitative method is based on secondary data analysis to provide a community profile of PRC-born migrant women in Brisbane and Queensland. This study firstly draws on literature reviews to explain historical, social, cultural and gender based factors underpinning PRC-born migrant women's settlement stress and health status. Findings reviews that settlement stress comes from social isolation and loneliness; cultural difficulties; lack of support prior to and after childbirth, as well as assistance with childcare; conflicts in both marital and familial relations; academic stress; and finally, problems in utilising public transport.  Particularly, this study highlights that downward mobility; barriers to access health services; and language barriers are a major source of stress and the cause of health problems for PRC-born migrant women when settling in Brisbane. As strategies, this study adapts health promotion strategies named as empowerment framework and Ottawa Charter action framework to address the needs highlighted in this study. Settlement stress affects health particularly mental health. Strategies provided in this study can also help migrant women from other non-English speaking countries. More significantly, this study encourages governments and service providers to pay more attention to migrant women's settlement processes in order to help them integrate into Australian society smoothly and quickly.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese migration</field><field name="subject">settlement experience</field><field name="subject">Brisbane</field><field name="subject">language barriers</field><field name="subject">isolation and lonliness</field><field name="subject">health needs</field><field name="subject">migrant women</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050824.110000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal Algorithmic Techniques of LASIK Procedures</field><field name="creator">Yi, Fan</field><field name="description">Clinical wavefront-guided corneal ablation has been now the most technologically advanced method to reduce the dependence of glasses and contact lenses. It has the potential not only to eliminate spherocylindrical errors but also to reduce higher-order aberrations (HOA). Recent statistics show that more than 96% of the patients who received laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) treatment reported their satisfaction about the improvement on vision, six months after the surgery. However, there are still patients complaining that their vision performance did not achieve the expectation or was even worse than before surgery. The reasons causing the unexpected post-surgical outcome include undercorrection, overcorrection, induced HOA, and other postoperative diseases, most of which are caused by inaccurate ablation besides other pathological factors. Therefore, to find out the method to optimize the LASIK procedures and provide a higher surgical precision has become increasingly important. A proper method to calculate ablation profile and an effective way to control the laser beam size and shape are key aspects in this research to resolve the problem. Here in this Master of Philosophy degree thesis, the author has performed a meticulous study on the existing methods of ablation profile calculation and investigated the efficiency of wavefront only ablation by a computer simulation  applying real patient data. Finally, the concept of a refractive surgery system with dynamical beam shaping function is sketched, which can theoretically overcome the disadvantages of traditional procedures with a finite laser beam size.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Higher order aberration</field><field name="subject">refractive error</field><field name="subject">LASIK</field><field name="subject">beam shaping</field><field name="subject">corneal ablation</field><field name="subject">wavefront</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070216.152339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the Integration of Learning Technology at Zayed University: A Case Study of a Laptop University in the United Arab Emirates</field><field name="creator">Young, Bradley J</field><field name="description">In the West there has been a substantial quantity of scholarly work about the integration of learning technologies at tertiary institutions and these works have at times been assigned a noteworthy role in governmental policy development. Although generalised statements have been made on the need for the effective integration of learning technology at national institutions of higher education situated in the Middle East, the issues surrounding the practical adoption of such technology are often more varied and complex than is usually supposed. Indeed, no substantive discussion of the subject has yet been undertaken for an institution situated within the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Yet, there is a clear need for such an analysis which has the potential to influence government policy in the UAE, thereby improving teaching and learning at a time of dramatic political change. The purpose of this study is to evaluate, through detailed investigation, the factors associated with the integration of learning technologies as they relate to the teaching and learning environment of Zayed University (the University). It examines the background of the University and the role technology plays within its curriculum, placing it within the unique political, social, and religious contexts of the UAE. In particular, what are the critical issues involved in the effective integration of technology into such a culturally distinctive higher education environment? An answer to this question involves exploring: (i) the role of technology as expressed in the University's visions and goals; (ii) the outcomes-based curriculum model and the role technology plays in supporting it through an electronic portfolio (ePortfolio) model; and (iii) the level of technology integration within the professional practice of Faculty. Instrumental to the findings of this research is the researcher's design and implementation strategy for a technology integration portfolio (TIP) model. In sum, this thesis presents information, implications and recommendations obtained from an evaluation of the current practices relating to the integration of learning technology into the University curriculum. It is from this information that a clear picture emerges of the present role of technology, at the same time providing possible directions for the next stage of the University's evolution. Indeed, this work responds in a practical way to the possibilities and problems involved in the formulation, implementation and efficient working of further learning technology initiatives at the University. Moreover, the findings of this thesis could also be transferred to other higher educational settings in the UAE that share similar curriculum models and goals for technology integration.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integration of learning technologies</field><field name="subject">tertiary institutions (United Arab Emirates)</field><field name="subject">Zayed University</field><field name="subject">learning technology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060804.162650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting Patterns of Early Literacy Achievement: A Longitudinal Study of Transition from Home To School</field><field name="creator">Young, Janelle Patricia</field><field name="description">This is a longitudinal study of patterns of children's early literacy development with a view to predicting literacy achievement after one year of schooling. The study fits within an emergent/social constructivist theoretical framework that acknowledges a child as an active learner who constructs meaning from signs and symbols in the company of other more experienced language users. Commencing in the final month of preschool, the literacy achievement of 114 young Australian students was mapped throughout Year 1. Data were gathered from measures of literacy achievement with the students, surveys with parents and surveys and checklists with teachers. Cross-time comparisons were possible as data were gathered three times from the students and teachers and twice from parents. Parents' perceptions of their children's personal characteristics, ongoing literacy development and family home literacy practices were examined in relation to children's measures of literacy achievement. Their perceptions were found to be accurate. Parents supported children's literacy growth at home in both the prior-to-school period and throughout Year 1. Teachers reflected on children's characteristics as members of their classes and on their knowledge of children's preparation for literacy. Generally, their predictions of literacy success were based on unsustainable connections with children's ability to concentrate, follow directions and stay on task. Children demonstrated a broad range of understandings about literacy in the prior-to-school period and teachers failed to acknowledge the extent of these. Children's prior-to-school understandings relating to the alphabet, environmental print, concepts about print and phonological awareness all predicted later literacy achievements. Alphabetic knowledge and environment print were found to be the strongest predictors. Results showed few significant school, age, home or gender effects. However, children's prior-to-school understandings of literacy were shown to predict later literacy achievement. Those with the greater level of knowledge prior-to-school generally maintained that advantage when later literacy achievements were measured.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive development in children</field><field name="subject">transition from home to school</field><field name="subject">early childhood education</field><field name="subject">literacy development</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061025.140003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Novel Concept and Context-Based Approach for Web Information Retrieval</field><field name="creator">Zakos, John</field><field name="description">Web information retrieval is a relatively new research area that has attracted a significant amount of interest from researchers around the world since the emergence of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s. The problems facing successful web information retrieval are a combination of challenges that stem from traditional information retrieval and challenges characterised by the nature of the World Wide Web. The goal of any information retrieval system is to provide an information need fulfilment in response to an information need. In a web setting, this means retrieving as many relevant web documents as possible in response to an inputted query that is typically limited to only containing a few terms expressive of the user's information need. This thesis is primarily concerned with firstly reviewing pertinent literature related to various aspects of web information retrieval research and secondly proposing and investigating a novel concept and context-based approach. The approach consists of techniques that can be used together or independently and aim to provide an improvement in retrieval accuracy over other approaches. A novel concept-based term weighting technique is proposed as a new method of deriving query term significance from ontologies that can be used for the weighting of inputted queries. A technique that dynamically determines the significance of terms occurring in documents based on the matching of contexts is also proposed. Other contributions of this research include techniques for the combination of document and query term weights for the ranking of retrieved documents. All techniques were implemented and tested on benchmark data. This provides a basis for performing comparison with previous top performing web information retrieval systems. High retrieval accuracy is reported as a result of utilising the proposed approach. This is supported through comprehensive experimental evidence and favourable comparisons against previously published results.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web information retrieval</field><field name="subject">World Wide Web</field><field name="subject">retrieval accuracy</field><field name="subject">weighting technique</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060303.104937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adenosine and the Coronary Vasculature in Normoxic and Post-Ischaemic Hearts</field><field name="creator">Zatta, Amanda J</field><field name="description">While previous research into the pathogenesis of ischaemic and reperfusion injuries has focussed on the cardiac myocyte, there is increasing evidence for a crucial role for coronary vascular injury in the genesis of the post-ischaemic phenotype [1-3]. Post-ischaemic vascular injury may be manifest as a transient or sustained loss of competent vessels, impairment of vascular regulatory mechanisms, and ultimately as the 'no-reflow' phenomenon (inability to sufficiently reperfuse previously ischaemic tissue despite the removal of the initial obstruction or occlusion). It is now appreciated that the earliest distinguishing feature of various forms of vascular injury (including atherosclerosis and infarction) is 'endothelial dysfunction', which is the marked reduction in endothelial-dependent relaxation due to reduced release or action of endothelial nitric oxide (NO). Importantly, vascular injury may worsen myocardial damage in vivo [4,5], significantly limiting tissue salvage and recovery. The pathogenesis of post-ischaemic vascular injury and endothelial dysfunction is incompletely understood, but has generally been considered to reflect a cardiovascular inflammatory response, neutrophils playing a key role. However, while blood-borne cells and inflammatory elements are undoubtedly involved in the 'progression' of vascular injury [6,7], accumulating evidence indicates that they are not the primary 'instigators' [8]. It should be noted that a wealth of controversial findings exists in the vascular injury literature and mechanisms involved remain unclear. Indeed, multiple mechanisms are likely to contribute to post-ischaemic vascular injury. Adenosine receptors are unique in playing a role in physical regulation of coronary function, and also in attenuating injury during and following ischaemia. While the adenosine receptor system has been extensively investigated in terms of effects on myocardial injury [9,10], little is known regarding potential effects of this receptor system on post-ischaemic coronary vascular injury. This thesis initially attempts to further our understanding of the role of adenosine in normal coronary vascular function, subsequent chapters assess the effect of ischaemia-reperfusion on vascular function, and adenosine receptor modification of vascular dysfunction in the isolated asanguinous mouse heart. Specifically, in Chapter 3 the receptor subtype and mechanisms involved in adenosine-receptor mediated coronary vasodilation were assessed in Langendorff perfused mouse and rat hearts. The study revealed that A2A adenosine receptors (A2AARs) mediate coronary dilation in the mouse vs. A2B adenosine receptors (A2BARs) in rat. Furthermore, responses in mouse involve a sensitive endothelial-dependent (NO-dependent) response and NO-independent (KATP-mediated) dilation. Interestingly, the ATP-sensitive potassium channel component predominates over NO-dependent dilation at moderate to high agonist levels. However, the high-sensitivity NO-dependent response may play an important role under physiological conditions when adenosine concentrations and the level of A2AAR activation are low. In Chapter 4 the mechanisms regulating coronary tone under basal conditions and during reactive hyperaemic responses were assessed in Langendorff perfused mouse hearts. The data support a primary role for KATP channels and NO in mediating sustained elevations in flow, irrespective of occlusion duration (5-40 s). However, KATP channels are of primary importance in mediating initial flow adjustments after brief (5-10 s) occlusions, while KATP (and NO) independent processes are increasingly important with longer (20-40 s) occlusion. Evidence is also presented for compensatory changes in KATP and/or NO mediated dilation when one pathway is blocked, and for a modest role for A2AARs in reactive hyperaemia. In Chapter 5 the impact of ischaemia-reperfusion on coronary function was examined, and the role of A1 adenosine receptor (A1AR) activation by endogenous adenosine in modifying post-ischaemic vascular function was assessed in isolated buffer perfused mouse hearts. The results demonstrate that ischaemia does modify vascular control and signficantly impairs coronary endothelial dilation in a model devoid of blood cells. Additionally, the data indicate that post-ischaemic reflow is significantly determined by A2AAR activation by endogenous adenosine, and that A1AR activation by endogenous adenosine protects against this model of vascular injury. Following from Chapter 5, the potential of A1, A2A and A3AR activation by exogenous and endogenous agonists to modulate post-ischaemic vascular dysfunction was examined in Chapter 6. Furthermore, potential mechanisms involved  injury and protection were assessed by comparing effects of adenosine receptors to other 'vasoprotective' interventions, including anti-oxidant treatment, Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) inhibition, endothelin (ET) antagonism, and 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM). The data acquired confirm that post-ischaemic endothelial dysfunction is reduced by intrinsic A1AR activation, and also that exogenous A3AR activation potently reduces vascular injury. Protection appears unrelated to inhibition of ET or oxidant stress. However, preliminary data suggest A3AR vasoprotection may share signalling with NHE inhibition. Finally, the data reveal that coronary reflow in isolated buffer perfused hearts is not a critical determinant of cardiac injury, suggesting independent injury processes in post-ischaemic myocardium vs. vasculature. Collectively, these studies show that adenosine has a significant role in regulating coronary vascular tone and reactive hyperaemic responses via NO and KATP dependent mechanisms. Ischaemia-reperfusion modifies vascular control and induces significant endothelial dysfunction in the absence of blood, implicating neutrophil independent injury processes. Endogenous adenosine affords intrinsic vasoprotection via A1AR activation, while adenosinergic therapy via exogenous A3AR activation represents a new strategy for directly protecting against post-ischaemic vascular injury.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adenosine</field><field name="subject">coronary vasculature</field><field name="subject">post-ischaemic phenotype</field><field name="subject">vascular injury</field><field name="subject">adenosine receptors</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051130.124230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bacterial Diversity of Australian Exotic Pine Forest Soil and Leaf Litter</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Li</field><field name="description">Forest plantations, widely grown for wood production, involve the selective promotion of single tree species, or replacement of natural species by exotic tree species. Slash pine (Pinus elliottii) has been chosen for reforestation of infertile sandy soils in southeast Queensland, Australia. These exotic pine plantations minimise soil and water losses, and are important scientific study sites. The soil environment of these plantations, though devoid of sufficient nutrients, oxygen and other factors, harbours innumerable bacteria that may play a crucial role in maintaining soil quality and ecosystem functions. These soil microorganisms also have the potential for use as sensitive biological indicators to reflect environmental changes. It is therefore essential to understand the interrelationships amongst bacterial communities and their environment by assessing their structural and functional diversity, and their responses to disturbances. The microbial community of an exotic pine plantation of subtropical Australia was analysed by both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. In this study, a leaf litter-soil core sample (25 cm x 40 cm) was collected from a 22-year-old slash pine plantation in southeast Queensland, Australia in October, 2003. The core sample was divided into three fractions, namely, L layer leaf litter, F layer leaf litter, and forest soil 0-10 cm. In the culture-independent study, a modified DNA extraction and purification method was used to obtain highly purified high-molecular-weight DNA. This DNA was successfully used to amplify bacterial 16S rRNA genes with universal primers Fd1 and R6, to produce products of approximately 1500 bp. PCRamplified 16S rRNA genes were subsequently cloned and a total of 194 clones from leaf litter and soil were partially sequenced (about 510 bp). The 16S rRNA gene sequences were analysed and grouped into several phylogroups (the sequences with a similarity value &#161;&#221; 98 % were regarded as phylogenetically similar and grouped into one phylogroup). Sequencing representatives (&#161;&#214; 1400 nucleotides) from each phylogenetic group confirmed that five bacterial phyla were represented in the forest soil clone library. Phylum Acidobacterium was the most abundant phylogenetic group in terms of the number of clones and accounted for 42 % of all examined soil clones. The Verrucomicrobiales and Proteobacteria were the second and third most abundant phylogenetic groups found in the soil clone libraries, accounting for 12 % and 11 % of the soil clones, respectively. About 8 % of all examined soil clones were Planctomycetes and 27 % of soil clones were phylogenetically unidentified. The large amount of unclassified clone sequences could imply that novel groups of bacteria were present in the forest soil. When the two fractions of leaf litter clone libraries were compared, Firmicutes was the only phylum represented in the L layer leaf litter clone library. Similarly, Firmicutes dominated the F layer leaf litter (79 % of the library), was followed by Proteobacteria (21 %). For the culture-dependent study, a total of 21 isolates which were considered to represent 334 colonies from the leaf litter and forest soil were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, indicating that L layer leaf litter and F layer leaf litter were dominated by Firmicutes (48 %) and Proteobacteria (69 %) respectively, and 91 % of the isolates from the forest soil were Firmicutes. Using culture-independent methods, Actinobacteria appeared to be absent from the L and F layer leaf litter and forest soil samples. The results implied that either the nucleic acids of Actinobacteria were difficult to extract or Actinobacteria were over represented in the culture-dependent examinations. Phylum Acidobacteria appeared to be numerically dominant and active members in most soils. However, only one named species had been isolated from an acid mine drainage site and reported by Kishimoto and Tano (1987). Analysis by culture-dependent methods revealed a different bacterial diversity, compared to the bacterial diversity from the 16S rRNA gene clone sequences. The most significant result was the observation that, as revealed by both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, the bacterial diversity presented in the leaf litter was greatly different from the community of the soil. During the culture-dependent bacterial diversity study, four novel strains were isolated from the forest soil and leaf litter samples and complete characterisations of these novel strains were carried out. Reports on the descriptions of Bacillus decisifrondis strain E5HC-32T from forest soil and Frondicola australicus strain E1HC-02T from L layer leaf litter have been published (appendix). The information provided by assessing the microbial communities in different fractions of leaf litter and forest soil improves our understanding of the phylogenetic relationship between soil and leaf litter. It is suggested, in this study, to perform both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods to characterise the bacterial structure and diversity in forest litter and soil samples, particularly in response to different forest management practices and global change. This study also provides the basis for further functional studies of the forest soil and leaf litter of exotic pine plantation in subtropical Australia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bacterial</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Exotic</field><field name="subject">Pine</field><field name="subject">Forest</field><field name="subject">Soil</field><field name="subject">Leaf Litter</field><field name="subject">Plantations</field><field name="subject">Wood</field><field name="subject">Tree</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071128.094745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Punching Shear Failure Analysis of Reinforced Concrete Flat Plates Using Simplified Ust Failure Criterion</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xuesong</field><field name="description">Failure criteria play a vital role in the numerical analysis of reinforced concrete structures. The current failure criteria can be classified into two types, namely the empirical and theoretical failure criteria. Empirical failure criteria normally lack reasonable theoretical backgrounds, while theoretical ones either involve too many parameters or ignore the effects of intermediate principal stress on the concrete strength. Based on the octahedral shear stress model and the concrete tensile strength under the state of triaxial and uniaxial stress, a new failure criterion, that is, the simplified unified strength theory (UST), is developed by simplifiing the five-parameter UST for the analysis of reinforced concrete structures. According to the simplified UST failure criterion, the concrete strength is influenced by the maximum and intermediate principal shear stresses together with the corresponding normal stresses. Moreover, the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the concrete strength is also taken into account. The failure criterion involves three concrete strengths, namely the uniaxial tensile and compressive strengths and the equal biaxial compressive strength. In the numerical analysis, a degenerated shell element with the layered approach is adopted for the simulation of concrete structures. In the layered approach, concrete is divided into several layers over the thickness of the elements and reinforcing steel is smeared into the corresponding number of layers of equivalent thickness. In each concrete layer, three-dimensional stresses are calculated at the integration points. For the material modelling, concrete is treated as isotropic material until cracking occurs. Cracked concrete is treated as an orthotropic material incorporating tension stiffening and the reduction of cracked shear stiffness. Meanwhile, the smeared craclc model is employed. The bending reinforcements and the stirrups are simulated using a trilinear material model. To verify the correctness of the simplified UST failure criterion, comparisons are made with concrete triaxial empirical results as well as with the Kupfer and the Ottosen failure criteria. Finally, the proposed failure criterion is used for the flexural analysis of simply supported reinforced concrete beams. Also conducted are the punching shear analyses of single- and multi-column-slab connections and of half-scale flat plate models. In view of its accuracy and capabilities, the simplified UST failure criterion may be used to analyse beam- and slab-type reinforced concrete structures.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reinforced concrete structures</field><field name="subject">unified strength theory</field><field name="subject">octahedral shear stress model</field><field name="subject">concrete tensile strength</field><field name="subject">triaxial stress</field><field name="subject">uniaxial stress</field><field name="subject">flexural analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051104.153239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agent Ordering and Nogood Repairs in Distributed Constraint Solving</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Lingzhong</field><field name="description">The distributed constraint satisfaction problem is a general formalization used to represent problems in distributed multi-agent systems. A large body of problems in artificial intelligence and computer science can be easily formulated as distributed constraint satisfaction problems. In this thesis we study agent ordering, effects of no-goods, search efficiency and threshold repairing in distributed constraint satisfaction problems and its variants. A summary of contributions is as follows: 1. We present a new algorithm, Dynamic Agent Ordering. A distinctive feature of this algorithm is that it uses the degree of unsatisfiability as a guiding parameter to dynamically determine agent ordering during the search. We show through an empirical study that our algorithm performs better than the existing approaches. In our approach, the independence of agents is guaranteed and agents without neighbouring relationships can run concurrently and asynchronously. (Part of this work was published in the Australian Al Conference (80)). 2. We extend the Dynamic Agent Ordering algorithm by incorporating a novel technique called nogood repairing. This results in a dramatic reduction in the nogoods being stored, and communication costs. In an empirical study, we11 show that this approach outperforms an equivalent static ordering algorithm and a current state-of-the-art technique in terms of execution time, memory usage and communication cost. (Part of this work was published at FLAIRS Conference (81)). Further, we introduce a new algorithm, Over-constrained Dynamic Agent Ordering, that breaks new ground in handling multiple variables per agent in distributed over-constrained satisfaction problems. The algorithm also uses the degree of unsatisfiability as a measure for relaxing constraints, and hence as a way to guide the search toward the best optimal solution(s). By applying our Threshold Repair method, we can solve a distributed constraint satisfaction problem without knowing whether the problem is under- or over-constrained. In an experimental study, we show that the new algorithm compares favourably to an implementation of asynchronous weak commitment search adapted to handle over-constrained problems. (Part of this work was published at the Canadian AI conference (79)).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Distributed contraint solving</field><field name="subject">nogood repairs</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">dynamic agent ordering</field><field name="subject">threshold repair</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070713.162515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Methodology to Calculate the Time-Varying Flow Through a Hydraulic Structure Connecting Two Water Bodies</field><field name="creator">Zigic, Sasha</field><field name="description">Hydraulic lock structures have been used for hundreds of years to control and maintain water levels in waterways.  The most common are gated water regulation structures used to catch and divert water, and form an essential and critical part of many flood control and agricultural schemes.  Although there are clear economic advantages to building the structures, they can contribute to major water quality problems for the waterways they influence (i.e. increased residence times and a change in mixing ability).  Further, in most cases, the methods previously used to assess how the structures and their operations influence the flow regimes between the two connected systems were limited, thus hydraulic designers rely on simple formulations, existing literature and experience.  Consequently, the objectives of this thesis were to undertake a detailed field study and develop a methodology and computer simulation tool to calculate the flow through a hydraulic structure connecting two water bodies so that future designs can be undertaken based upon sound knowledge. To demonstrate the outcomes of this thesis, the methodology and model were applied to an existing hydraulic structure (referred to as Structure C).  Structure C is used to connect and exchange water between the tidally dominated section of the Nerang River estuary and an artificial lake system (Burleigh Lakes) on the Gold Coast, Australia.  The gates of this structure open four times each day (once during each semi-diurnal tidal phase) and remain open for a period of 2 hours, allowing alternative and partial exchange between the two water bodies. To gain a better understanding of the dynamics of each waterbody under the influence of the structure, a series of detailed field experiments were initially undertaken to understand and quantify the exchange of water and its mixing ability.  Tide gauges deployed within the lake indicated a water level change during each opening of up to 22 cm, equating to 413,600 m3 of water entering the lake over the 2 hour discharge period.  Salinity profiles showed that the structure permitted the exchange of saline and freshwater between the two systems, during each tidal cycle, in turn maintaining the lake system as a saline (brackish environment).  However, the field study also revealed that the controlled exchange of water between the systems perpetuated a permanently stratified environment on both sides of the structure. To simulate the flow dynamics influenced by Structure C, new routines were incorporated into an existing hydrodynamic model (BFHYDRO) within the model's grid and computational code, as part of this thesis.  To achieve this, the flow in and out of the hydraulic structure cell (used to represent the hydraulic structure's location within the model grid) was calculated entirely from the local water level gradients on either side of the structure at each time-step, and not prescribed.  This was found to be essential for complex tidally-dominated systems, such as the Nerang River.  Routines were also developed to replicate the opening and closing times of the gates. Following the development of the methodology, the hydraulic structure cells were tested and applied to simulate the flow through Structure C and the complex exchange between the estuary and lake, in 2 and 3-dimensions.  Tests indicated that the opening and closing times of the gates and the calibration of the discharge coefficient (which forms part of the broad-crested weir formula) were the most sensitive parameters to ensure the correct volume of water exchange between the two systems.  Statistically, the model-predicted results compared very well with available surface elevation data within the estuary and lake, and thus, quantified the ability of the hydraulic structure cells to simulate the flux between the estuary and lake for each opening.  Following the model validation process, results from the existing configuration were compared with hypothetical design alternatives and are documented herein. Further, part of the thesis also explored a practical and effective computer based learning strategy to introduce and teach hydrodynamic and water quality modelling, to the next generation of undergraduate engineering students.  To enhance technology transfer a computer based instructional (CBI) aid was specifically developed to assist with the setup, execution and the analysis of models' output, in small easy steps.  The CBI aid comprised of a HTML module with links to recorded Lotus Screen cam movie clips.  The strategy proved to be a useful and effective approach in assisting the students to complete the project with minimum supervision, and acquire a basic understanding of water quality modelling. Finally, it is anticipated that this new modelling capability and the findings detailed herein will provide managers with a valuable tool to assess the influence of these structures on water circulation for present and future operations within the region.  This model can also be set up at other sites to pre-assess various design configurations by predicting changes in current flows, mixing and flushing dynamics that a particular design might achieve, and assist with the selection process before the final selection and construction.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydraulic lock structures</field><field name="subject">time-varying flow</field><field name="subject">tide guages</field><field name="subject">Nerang River estuary (Queensland)</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast (Queensland)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060111.145655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese-Australian relations from 1969 to 1983, with special emphasis on the role played by the two major Australian parties</field><field name="creator">Bray, Barbara (Barbara Dorothee)</field><field name="description">Typescript (Photocopy) Errata slip inserted.

In the existing body of work around the Gay Games they are analysed as an international gay and lesbian sporting event (Cramer, 1996; Krane et al., 2001; Pronger, 2000; Waitt, 2005), as a gay and lesbian community event (Krane &amp; Waldron, 2000; Symons, 2002, 2004; Waitt, 2003, 2006), and as a cultural site where discourses of nationality, sport and sexuality converge (Miller, 2001; Probyn, 2000; Rowe et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2005; Waitt, 2005; Waitt &amp; Markwell, 2006). This thesis builds on these investigations, asking specific questions about the ways in which discourses of sexuality and citizenship are produced and governed within and across the Sydney 2002 Gay Games promotional and media materials. The analysis is guided by Michel Foucault&#65533;s notion of governmentality (1991) and the works of related theorists who map the disparate array of neoliberal mechanisms of government that &#65533;conduct the conduct&#65533; and &#65533;act on the actions&#65533; of individuals and certain populations (Bratich et al., 2003; Gordon, 1991; Larner, 2000; Larner &amp; Walters, 2002, 2004; Miller, 1993; Rabinow &amp; Rose, 2003; Rose, 1996a, 1999). The analysis begins by asking how discourses of the autonomous, neo-liberal subject converge with discourses of &#65533;global living&#65533; such that individuals are invited to imagine themselves as increasingly flexible, freedom-loving (Rose, 1999), self-assured, cosmopolitan global citizens. The idea of the global imagination is then used to explore the ways in which the Gay Games commitment to &#65533;total inclusion&#65533; and its promise of personal and community transformation rely on similar neo-liberal renderings of tbe subject. It argues that the event&#65533;s &#65533;political&#65533; promises not only normalise certain forms of identity-based consumption (Chasin, 2000), they also (re)produce and normalise a very entrepreneurial, western-centric, cosmopolitan &#65533;brand&#65533; of global queer citizenship. The thesis also emphasises the important role that images and image-related technologies played in upholding normative meanings around queer sexuality and queer citizenship at the Games. In doing so, the thesis argues that images and technologies do more than simply represent individuals&#65533; lived experiences. Images, it argues, are (inter)active entities that produce and shape individuals&#65533; understanding of the &#65533;real&#65533; and how they come to know themselves as certain types of subjects. Where the Sydney 2002 Gay Games were concerned, images were integral in producing normative meanings around gender, sexuality and citizenship and in governing participants&#65533; experiences as &#65533;locals&#65533;, &#65533;global visitors&#65533;, &#65533;athletes&#65533;, &#65533;cultural participants&#65533; and consumers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gay Games (6th : 2002 : Sydney</field><field name="subject">N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">festivals</field><field name="subject">gay athletes</field><field name="subject">lesbian athletes</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080514.131842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Connectionist-Based Intelligent Information Systems for image analysis and knowledge engineering : applications in horticulture</field><field name="creator">Woodford, Brendon James</field><field name="description">New Zealand&#65533;s main export earnings come from the primary production area including agriculture, horticulture, and viticulture. One of the major contributors in this area of horticulture is the production of quality export grade fruit; specifically apples. In order to maintain a competitive advantage, the systems and methods used to grow the fruit are constantly being refined and are increasingly based on data collected and analysed by both the orchardist who grows the produce and also researchers who refine the methods used to determine high levels of fruit quality. 
 To support the task of data analysis and the resulting decision-making process it requires efficient and reliable tools. This thesis attempts to address this issue by applying the techniques of Connectionist-Based Intelligent Information Systems (CBIIS) for Image Analysis and Knowledge Discovery. Using advanced neurocomputing techniques and a novel knowledge engineering methodology, this thesis attempts to seek some solutions to a set of specific problems that exist within the horticultural domain. 
 In particular it describes a methodology based on previous research into neuro-fuzzy systems for knowledge acquisition, manipulation, and extraction and furthers this area by introducing a novel and innovative knowledge-based architecture for knowledge-discovery using an on-line/real-time incremental learning system based on the Evolving Connectionist System (ECOS) paradigm known as the Evolving Fuzzy Neural Network (EFuNN). 
 The emphases of this work highlights knowledge discovery from these data sets using a novel rule insertion and rule extraction method. The advantage of this method is that it can operate on data sets of limited sizes. This method can be used to validate the results produced by the EFuNN and also allow for greater insight into what aspects of the collected data contribute to the development of high quality produce.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image analysis</field><field name="subject">expert systems (computer science)</field><field name="subject">horticulture</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080515.111549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A quantitative and qualitative study of early childhood caries among young children in the Emirate of Ajman, United Arab Emirates</field><field name="creator">Hashim, Raghad</field><field name="description">Objectives: The objective of the quantitative research was to estimate the prevalence of Early Childhood Caries (ECC) and severe Early Childhood Caries (s-ECC) and the severity of Early Childhood Caries (ECC) in the primary dentition of young children in Ajman, UAE, and investigate their association with child and family characteristics, dietary habits, fluoride use, oral hygiene practices and dental services utilization. The purpose of the qualitative research was to obtain information that could explain some of the findings of the quantitative stage in order to progress towards determining a strategy to control ECC in this population. 
 Methods: A two-stage cluster sample was used to randomly select children aged 5 or 6 years old who were enrolled in public or private schools in Ajman, UAE. Clinical examinations for caries were conducted by a single examiner using WHO criteria. Parents completed questionnaires seeking information on child and family characteristics, dietary habits, oral hygiene, fluoride use and dental service utilization. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify risk markers and risk indicators for caries experience. To complement the quantitative findings, the second (qualitative) stage of the research was conducted with six chosen groups of mothers from different educational backgrounds and different nationalities. Each group contained between six and ten mothers - some of whose children had been examined in the quantitative section of the project. The mothers were invited to comment on the significance for them of those risk indicators identified in the earlier section of the research. The manual thematic coding method of analysis was used. Problems concerning the dental health of children were identified based on the results of both stages. 
 Results: The total number of children sampled was 1297. Dental examination and questionnaire data were obtained for 1036 (79.9%), of whom 50.0% were female. The prevalence of ECC in 5- and 6-year-old children was 72.9% (95% CI, 61.8, 83.9) and 80.0% (95% CI, 76.0, 84.4) respectively, with mean dmft scores of 4.0 (sd, 4.1) and 4.9 (sd, 4.3) respectively (P&lt;0.05). The overall prevalence of s-ECC was 31.1% (95% CI, 23.6, 38.9). Multivariate analysis indicated that frequency of snacking between meals per day, snack consumption level and the frequency of brushing had a significant effect on the severity of ECC, while only the snack consumption level and the frequency of brushing had a significant effect on plaque score. There was a strong association between plaque score and the severity of ECC. The total number of mothers who contributed to the qualitative study was 42. The findings of the qualitative stage showed that some mothers had a negative perception toward the primary dentition and unhelpful attitudes towards their children&#65533;s diets (through promoting a high consumption of cariogenic food), while the use of fluoride (other than in toothpaste) was rare. However, many mothers were in favor of bottled water fluoridation once they understood the benefits of such a scheme and supported the idea of a dental preventive program beng provided through their children&#65533;s schools. 
 Conclusions: The prevalence and severity of ECC in young children in Ajman is high, with child and family characteristics, dietary habits, oral hygiene practices and dental utilization being important determinants. Young children in Ajman would benefit from health promotion strategies directed towards appropriate dietary practices and oral hygiene measures framed within culturally specific guidelines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental caries in children</field><field name="subject">dental care</field><field name="subject">child health services</field><field name="subject">mouth</field><field name="subject">care and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Ajman</field><field name="subject">United Arab Emirates</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080521.144521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hospitality management perspectives on casino tourism in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Jitpraphai, Supatcharajit</field><field name="description">Apparently, gambling seems to be valued as a leisure activity and a form of entertainment in many parts of the world. Public attitudes toward gambling have shifted from viewing it as a vice to treating it as an opportunity to exploit (Eadington 1997, 2000). Relaxation of constraints on existing commercial gaming activities and legislative change in authorising gambling has occurred extensively. The proliferation of casinos makes people perceive gambling as a legitimate activity and as an economic hope. According to Pizam and Pokela (1985), casino gambling however is a controversial tourism development strategy. Eadington (1986) also points out that legalised gambling causes economic and social changes in communities and changes their image. Thus, both the character and reputation of the community may be altered as a result of initiating casinos as a tourist attraction. 
 The legalisation of gambling has been a subject of considerable debates in Thailand for a decade and it has been brought into the cabinet&#65533;s meeting from time to time. Some politicians and academic scholars suggest that casinos should be introduced as a tourism development strategy to combat the country&#65533;s economic and financial crisis. Many people are attached to strong belief that gambling is a sinful activity. It is inherently immoral and contrary to accepted family and social values. It is a voluntary regressive tax in which its effects fall most heavily on lower-income groups. It is morally wrong, and can cause an addiction that is often linked to personal and family tragedies. It also attracts criminal activities and political corruption (Piriyarangsan et al. 2003; Cornwel-Smith 2005). As social acceptance of casino gambling has globally increased, this research aims to gauge hospitality management perspectives on gambling and casino tourism. The focus of the paper is to investigate hospitality executives&#65533; attitudes towards relationship between Thai tourism and casino gambling; to explore their views on casino legalisation and regulation; as well as to examine their opinions about casino impacts, operation and management if casinos are legalised in Thailand. 
 Mail questionnaires were carried out during September 2003 - February 2004, resulting in 212 returns of respondents. Then, 18 semi-structured interviews with hotel and tour executives, politicians, policemen, government officials, directors of social service organisations and religious leaders were undertaken in May - July 2005 to acquire more insights into the issues. A combination of quantitative and qualitative data indicates that Thai people have mixed feelings about casino tourism. Although quantitative findings show hospitality group welcome the idea, but they do not want it in their own backyard. Qualitative results are more in opposition. Majority of interviewees hold the differing views. The study concludes that casinos gambling may function simply as a value added or an enhancement to a destination in Thailand, not a main tourism attraction. It is strongly suggested that casino gambling and Thai tourism industry should not be connected. Instead, &#65533;Thai&#65533; hospitality and cultures should be promoted as a unique tourism product of Thailand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">casinos</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080523.122348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced numerical modelling in dental research</field><field name="creator">Ichim, Ionut P</field><field name="description">The understanding of the masticatory apparatus including its functional and structural relationship with other components of the cranium increasingly requires an interdisciplinary approach. Recently, "traditional biological sciences" such as anatomy, comparative biology, anthropology and evolution have increasingly meshed with elements from other domains, such as mechanical engineering and material sciences, which has resulted in new and exciting paradigms to be explored. This is particularly true in the field of craniofacial biomechanics yet there are still many unexplored issues and numerous questions that remain unanswered. Numerical modelling in general and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in particular, represent a numerical experimental procedure to generate such information. Originally derived from the field of structural engineering, FEA has steadily permeated its way into craniofacial biomechanics and has proven itself as a most useful scientific tool. 
 The present study introduces an engineering-based workframe for applying FEA to craniofacial biomechanical research in a comprehensive manner to cover the entire analytical spectrum, from developing questions to providing their solutions. The study is composed of two major experimental parts addressing both the linear elastic and the non-linear behaviour of some biomaterials encountered in the craniofacial arena. In the first part I analysed mandibular biomechanics using linear elastic models while in the second part I used nonlinear discrete models to determine the optimal elastic properties of the cervical restorative materials. 
 Modern humans have a number of anatomical features that set us apart from our ancestors. Amongst these perhaps the most striking is the emergence of a protruding chin, otherwise absent in other archaic humans and hominids. While it has been shown that the chin has its embryological origins in the postnatal remodelling of bone in the area around the mandibular symphysis which produces the midline keel in the form of an inverted &#65533;T&#65533; the functional significance of this novel evolutionary feature is still obscure. 
 It is accepted that the mandible is optimally designed for resisting masticatory stress, whereby optimal is seen as maximual strength at the lowest biological cost. Here, I tested the currently most accepted theory, namely that the chin provides mechanical resistance to the mandible during mastication. In other words, I tested the hypothesis that a chinned mandible would be stiffer and hence experience lower strains when compared to a non-chinned counterpart under identical loadings. My functional analysis consisted firstly of three simple models which reproduce a simian shelf, a flat and a chinned symphysis, loaded using two unidirectional loadcases (torsion and wishboning) to represent a distortion similar to that which occurs in the mandible during mastication. Secondly, I developed complex geometrical models which incorporated the cortical bone, medullary bone and teeth. The models were then analysed using the same loadcases as those used for the first theoretical models. Additionally, I incorporated the coronal bending and also a coupled loadcase which simulated the complex deformation of the mandible during biting. The aim here was to test the hypothesis that the presence of a chin changed the strain pattern in the mastication-loaded mandible. The results were then interpreted using Frost&#65533;s mechanostat theory which relates in a more precise manner the mechanical loading environment to the adaptive response of the bone. My results showed that the calculated strain values for both the chinned and flat mandibles were within the normal bone maintenance levels of the mechanostat during molar biting. In other words, variation in bone strain magnitude across the mandible, which should differ between the chinned and the non-chinned mandibles if the hypothetical mechanical role of the chin is true, is similar in both forms. I concluded that the development of the human chin is thus unrelated to the functional demands placed upon it by mastication. 
 I suggested a new functional demand associated with pronounced tongue activity during speech. I hypothesise that it is the resistance to stresses induced by strong, repetitive contractions of the tongue and perioral musculature during, phonation that shaped the modern human chin. I tested my hypothesis by loading the symphyseal region with two principal nonmasticatory, muscle systems; firstly, the tongue and secondly the peri-oral muscular curtain, anterior to the symphysis. My results suggested that the flat, non-chinned symphysis when subjected to speech-related genioglossal movements will undergo adaptive changes which would result in an optimised (chinned) shape, such as that found in the modern human symphysis. 
 These results thus offer a new foundation to an old hypothesis and a solution to the longstanding controversy over the origin of the human chin. I conclude that forces generated by speech rather than those generated by mastication, shaped the chin in anatomically modern humans. 
 Prompted by an earlier observation I further investigated the apparent cross-over distribution of strains on the mandibular corpora during mastication. In doing so, I tested the hypothesis that this cross-over may be linked with another particular anatomical feature of the mandible that of the postcanine cortical asymmetry, which appears to be stereotypical among anthropoids. The results of my study hence suggest that strain patterns within the human mandible are more complex than previously thought. Not only do strains differ between lingual and buccal aspects of working and non-working sides, but they also differ within these areas (i.e. from alveolus to corpus, to lower border regions). I conclude that postcanine cortical asymmetry may be a retained evolutionary trait rather than the result of masticatory biomechanics. 
 In the second section of the thesis I introduced a different analysis regime which allows the prediction of fracture initiation and propagation. In this part I analysed the mechanics underlying the failure of the restorations placed in non-carious cervical lesions and suggested changes in the material properties of the restorations used to treat them. 
 Non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) include those entities characterised by the cervical loss of hard dental tissue that occurs in the absence of any carious process. To distinguish between lesions that occur due to excessive occlusal load and other non-carious cervical lesion (i.e. erosion and abrasion) the clinical term "abfraction" has been adopted. Although a common clinical issue, failure of restoration placed in these lesions has not been subjected to a rigorous biomechanical analysis. 
 To determine which of the material&#65533;s parameters should be changed and to what extent, I employed a combined numerical approach. 
 Here I introduced a novel approach in simulating the cracking of restorative materials and tooth tissues which is based on a simpler material formulation and can be used in an advanced nonlinear numerical analysis. The material model I used allows automatic crack insertion and growth and also uniquely accounts for the microdamage which precedes the instalment of macroscopic cracks. 
 The first step was to balance the factors that may affect failure employing a linear analysis with a stress-based approach to failure. Here, the aim was to investigate the influence of lesion shape and depth as well as the direction of occlusal loading on the mechanical response of the cervical glass-ionomer cements restoration in a lower first premolar. This analysis showed that the direction of loading was the major contributor to the failure of the restoration. 
 The next step was to apply this fracture model to the restorations of the NCCL in order to verify if the material is able to accurately simulate the location and type of mechanical failure. The data for this problem, i.e. the geometry and the loadcase were derived from the conclusions of linear analysis, that is I chose the "worst case scenario" as the upper boundary of material endurance. My results showed that under the action of para-functional loadings the GIC failed on the cervical margin. I also showed that prior to fracture the restorative material undergoes strain softening, which in turn introduces damage and weakens the materials involved. After successfully testing the proposed model, the final step was to determine which material properties and restorative techniques would be most reliable under given biomechanical conditions. The present work relied on the hypothesis that a more flexible material would partially buffer the local stress concentration and hence reduce the likelihood of mechanical failure of the restoration. 
 My study, a first of its kind, proposes a radical approach to address the problems of material improvement, namely: numerical-based material optimisation engineering. That is, I aimed to identify the "most favourable" selection of elastic modulus or E value for the restorative material, which will allow it to survive under the unfavourable occlusal loading conditions that may prevail. Two filling techniques were considered; firstly a single bulk material, namely glass-ionomer (GIC) and secondly a layered technique. The latter consisted of a layer of GIC supporting a composite bulk restorative. I chose two thicknesses for the GIC layer, 50 and 150 microns. My results showed that the restorative materials currently used in cervical non-carious lesions are largely unsuitable in terms of resistance to fracture of the restoration mostly because of their relative high stiffness irrespective of the filling technique. The best results are obtained for a bulk filling with a 1GPa elastic modulus material case in which the tensile stresses are about 50% of the failure limit. This approach in determining the mechanical properties of the restorative is novel and unique so far in the dental literature. The direct benefit of this study was the improvement of the restorative material, as it can be engineered to withstand the conditions identified as major cause of failure. This is consonant with the call for new materials better tailored for some specific needs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Finite element method</field><field name="subject">numerical analysis</field><field name="subject">dentistry</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">structural optimization</field><field name="subject">craniometry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080605.133323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrophysiological studies on the mechanism of action of the novel antiepileptic drug lacosamide</field><field name="creator">Errington, Adam C</field><field name="description">Lacosamide (LCM) is a new antiepileptic drug with a previously unknown mode of action.

 In a 4-aminopyridine model of tonic-clonic seizures in rat visual cortex in vitro, LCM stereoselectively reduced maximal frequency and duration of tonic activity with EC[50&#65533;s] of 71 and 41 [mu]M respectively. LCM (100 [mu]M) significantly reduced excitability in whole cell patch clamped neurons producing non-selective reduction in the incidence of excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; LCM: 46.1 &#65533; 15.5 %, P &lt;0.01, n = 4, IPSCs; LCM: 24.9 &#65533; 9.6 %, P &lt;0.01, n = 4) and block of spontaneous action potentials (EC&#8325;&#8320; 61 [mu]M). The inhibitory effects of LCM did not result from changes in passive membrane properties (including resting membrane potential or input resistance) as assessed by application of voltage ramps between -70 to +20 mV. LCM did not mimic the effects of diazepam as an allosteric modulator of GABA[A] receptor currents, nor did it inhibit evoked excitatory currents mediated by AMPA or NMDA receptors. Unlike phenytoin (DPH), carbamazepine (CBZ) or lamotrigine (LTG) that blocked sustained action potential firing evoked by brief depolarising steps (750 ms) or ramps (-70 to 20 mV, 90 mV.sec&#8315;&#65533;), LCM could weakly reduce the frequency of action potentials evoked by brief depolarisation suggesting a potential interaction with VGSCs. In accordance with this, the effect of LCM upon neurotransmission was negated in the presence of tetrodotoxin (200 nM, TTX). The frequency of miniature EPSCs was not altered by the drug (100 [mu]M). These results discounted some crucial potential anticonvulsant targets for LCM but implied a potential interaction with electrogenic VGSCs. 
 When SRF duration was prolonged (10 s) LCM produced significant (P &lt;0.01, n = 4-10, EC&#8325;&#8320;: 48 [mu]M) inhibition, but not within the first second of the burst EC&#8325;&#8320;: 640 [mu]M). Evoked TTX sensitive sodium currents in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells were significantly reduced by LCM, CBZ, LTG and DPH when V[h]: -60 mV. Hyperpolarizing pulses (500 ms) to -100 mV could reverse block by CBZ, LTG and DPH but not LCM. The V&#8325;&#8320; for steady state fast inactivation was more hyperpolarized by CBZ (-79.45 &#65533; 2.64 mV, n = 5, P &lt; 0.001), LTG (-72.30 &#65533; 1.70 mV, n = 6, P &lt;0.05) and DPH (-77.17 &#65533; 2.32 mV, n = 6, P &lt;0.05) but not by LCM (-65.02 &#65533; 1.75 mV, n = 6, CONTROL: -65.84 &#65533; 0.86 mV). In contrast to CBZ, LCM did not slow recovery from fast inactivation or produce frequency dependent facilitation of block of a 3 s, 10 Hz pulse train. LCM (100 [mu]M) did produce a (V&#8325;&#8320;: CONTROL ~64 mV, LCM -57.47 &#65533; 4.53 mV, P &lt;0.001, n = 4-8) hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of slow sodium channel inactivation and promoted channel entry into the slow inactivated state (P &lt;0.001, n = 6) but did not alter the rate of recovery. I therefore conclude that LCM produces inhibition of epileptiform cellular activity, at least in part, via enhancement of voltage gated sodium channel slow inactivation and represents a molecule possessing a unique anticonvulsant mechanism of action.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anticonvulsants</field><field name="subject">mechanism of action</field><field name="subject">epilepsy</field><field name="subject">chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">Lacosamide</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080613.162038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the roles of the PsbL, PsbM, PsbT and Psb27 subunits of Photosystem II in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803</field><field name="creator">Bentley, Fiona K</field><field name="description">The PsbL, PsbM and PsbT subunits of photosystem II (PSII) are single-helix membrane-spanning proteins found at the monomer-monomer interface that may stabilize the dimeric complex. This study has characterised strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 where psbL, psbM and psbT have been interrupted by the insertion of antibiotic-resistance cassettes. The [Delta]PsbL strain exhibited slowed growth that correlated with a disruption in PSII assembly leading to an accumulation of CP43-less PSII monomers. Moreover, the [Delta]PsbL:[Delta]PsbM and [Delta]PsbL:[Delta]PsbT double mutants were not photoautotrophic. In contrast, the [Delta]PsbM and [Delta]PsbT strains grew photoautotrophically and supported oxygen evolution, albeit at reduced rates compared to wild type. S-state analyses showed that the removal of PsbM or PsbT did not affect the donor side reactions of PSII, which includes the oxidation of water, however, the removal of PsbT impaired electron flow between Q[A] and Q[B] on the acceptor side of PSII. Blue-Native PAGE revealed that removal of either PsbM or PsbT was insufficient to entirely disrupt dimer formation; however, the combined removal of PsbM and PsbT resulted in the predominance of monomeric forms of PSII in the [Delta]PsbM:[Delta]PsbT strain. Under high light (2 mE m&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533; at 30&#65533;C), [Delta]PsbM and [Delta]PsbT cells were considerably more susceptible to photoinactivation than wild type; however, they were able to fully recover in a protein synthesis-dependent manner when returned to moderate light levels (0.03 mE m&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533;). A requirement for Psb27 was found in the protein-synthesis-dependent recovery of photoinactivated [Delta]PsbT cells. More significantly, an absolute functional requirement was found for Psb27 in the [Delta]PsbM strain, where functional PSII complexes are not assembled in the absence of Psb27. These results suggest that Psb27 is critical for PSII assembly in the absence of PsbM, and also for the protein-synthesis-dependent recovery of PSII in the absence of PsbT. Moreover, in addition to Psb27, the PsbU subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex was also found to be an absolute functional requirement in the [Delta]PsbM strain, where functional PSII centres are not assembled when both PsbM and PsbU are absent. It appears, therefore, that PsbM has crucial functional interactions with specific extrinsic proteins located in the vicinity of the oxygen-evolving complex. Interestingly, the [Delta]PsbM strain was also found to have a high susceptibility to suppressor mutations, indicating it has important functional roles in the cyanobacterial cell.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">photosynthetic bacteria</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080627.151048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation and physico-chemical characterisation of microemulsion-based nanoparticles</field><field name="creator">Graf, Anja</field><field name="description">Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate possible effects of different microemulsion structure-types and types of monomer used on the formation of poly(alkylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles, the entrapment into and release of insulin from these formulations as well as the bioactivity of the insulin upon intragastric delivery of the insulin-loaded nanoparticles dispersed in the microemulsion template. 
 Methods: For two different microemulsion systems consisting of water, isopropyl myristate and either sugar-based surfactants or a macrogol glyceride-based surfactant-mixture, pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were established. Microemulsion samples therein were identified and characterised with polarising light microscopy, viscosity and conductivity measurements, differential scanning calorimetry, cryo-field emission scanning electron microscopy and self-diffusion nuclear magnetic resonance to determine the microemulsion structure-type. Nanoparticles were prepared from various microemulsion templates by interfacial polymerisation using ethyl (2) cyanoacrylate and butyl (2) cyanoacrylate. Particle size distribution and surface charge were measured using photon correlation spectroscopy and electrophoretic mobility. The morphology of the particles was characterised by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Insulin was used as a model protein and the amount entrapped into and released from the particles was determined using a reverse phase HPLC assay. A diabetic rat model was employed to examine the bioactivity of different nanoparticle-microemulsion formulations with blood glucose and serum insulin as parameters measured by a proprietary glucometer and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. 
 Results: The microemulsion system based on sugar-surfactants only formed solution-type microemulsions which could not all satisfactorily be used as a polymerisation template in the presence of insulin. The system however also showed an environmentally responsive gelling behaviour which may be suitable for depot delivery. The macrogol glyceride-based microemulsion system resulted in microemulsions with a continuous transition from water-in-oil to oil-in-water droplet-types via the bicontinuous structure-type. Microemulsion samples of each structure-type could serve as nanoparticle templates and resulted in particles with similar properties. Entrapment efficiency of insulin into the nanoparticles was template and monomer dependent. However, insulin was found to interfere with the polymerisation leading to a high variability in entrapment and release kinetics of these drug delivery systems. The degree of interference depended on the type of monomer and the size of the aqueous pseudo-phase of the microemulsion template. The interpretation of the results was further complicated by a possible competitive polymerisation initiation of insulin with the surfactant-mixture. Upon intragastric administration of the insulin-loaded nanoparticles dispersed in the oil-in-water microemulsion template a significant reduction in blood glucose could be achieved for up to 30 hours. However, no significant serum insulin concentration was detectable. 
 Conclusions: Structurally different microemulsion templates resulting in nanoparticles with similar properties may offer increased formulation flexibility, in that a microemulsion template can be chosen which best solubilises the drug. Thus the microemulsions investigated in this thesis may serve as nanoparticle templates for designing entrapment processes for peptides and proteins with a simple one-step preparation by interfacial polymerisation. However, only if one was able to optimise and control the factors leading to the high entrapment and release variability these nanoparticles on the basis of microemulsions might be promising carriers for the oral delivery of peptide and protein bioactives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">emulsions (pharmacy)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080701.121440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming folk : innovation and tradition in English folk-rock music</field><field name="creator">Burns, Robert</field><field name="description">From a mixed methodology perspective that includes ethnology, musicology and cultural anthropology, I argue that, despite initial detachment from folk revivalism, English folk-rock has moved closer to aspects of tradition and historical status and has embraced a revivalist stance similar to that of the folk revivals that occurred earlier in the twentieth century. Whereas revivalism often rejects manifestations of mass culture and modernity, I also argue that the early combinations of folk music and rock music demonstrated that aspects of preservation and commercialisation have always co-existed within this hybrid musical style. English folk-rock, a former progressive rock music style, has emerged in the post-punk era as a world music style that appeals to a broad spectrum of music fans and this audience does not regard issues such as maintenance of authenticity and tradition as key factors in the preservation process. 
 Rock music has remained a stimulus for further change in folk music and has enabled English folk-rock to become regarded as popular music by a new audience with diverse musical tastes. When folk music was adapted into rock settings, the result represented a particular identity for folk music at that time. In a similar way, as folk music continues to be amalgamated with rock and other popular music styles, or is performed in musical settings representing new cultures and ethnicities now present in the United Kingdom, it becomes updated and relevant to new audiences. From this perspective, I propose that growth in the popularity of British folk music since the early 1970s can be linked to its performance as English folk-rock, to its connections with culture and music industry marketing and promotion techniques, and to its inclusion as a 1990s festival component presented to audiences as part of what is promoted as world music. Popularity of folk music presented at world music festivals has stimulated significant growth in folk music audiences since the mid-1990s and consequently the UK is experiencing a new phase of revivalism - the third folk revival.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">folk-rock music</field><field name="subject">folk music</field><field name="subject">popular music</field><field name="subject">Great Britain</field><field name="subject">history and criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080701.132922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcript analysis of proliferative endosperm from Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="creator">Day, Robert Charles</field><field name="description">Arabidopsis has emerged as an important model system for molecular plant biology. The extensive resources available for Arabidopsis make it an attractive system to study the molecular mechanisms involved in early seed development. During the early stages of seed development Arabidopsis endosperm is syncytial and proliferates rapidly through repeated rounds of mitosis without cytokinesis. This stage of endosperm development is both important in determining final seed size and is a model for studying various aspects of cellular and molecular biology, such as the cell cycle and genomic imprinting. However, the small size of Arabidopsis seed, the syncytial nature of the proliferative endosperm, and the surrounding maternal tissues make high throughput molecular analysis of the early endosperm technically difficult. 
 To get around this we used laser capture microdissection to enable transcript analysis of the early proliferative endosperm of Arabidopsis at 4 days after pollination (DAP). Microarray results identified several thousand genes with endosperm expression, including many that were endosperm preferred. A number of genes were validated by relative quantification PCR and were consistent with the findings of the microarray. Meta analysis of the endosperm transcriptome revealed a developmental program dominated by mitosis and under the influence of several phytohormones, predominated by cytokinin signaling. 
 The list of endosperm-preferred genes included all characterised imprinted genes in Arabidopsis. Imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon by which genes are expressed predominantly from either their paternal or their maternal allele and very few imprinted genes have been identified in plants. The mono-allelic expression of the characterised imprinted genes appears to be limited to the endosperm where they provide important regulatory controls for seed development via direct effects on endosperm development. Genes from the endosperm-preferred list were screened for mono-allelic expression using sequence polymorphisms between the Colombia and Landsberg erecta ecotypes. We generated PCR products that spanned the polymorphisms of 67 genes from template obtained by laser capture of endosperm tissue from hybrid seed. Sequence analysis revealed three genes which gave strong allelic bias toward the maternal allele (At2g32460, At1g55550 and At2g21420) and one biased for the paternal allele (At1g47840). 
 In summary, laser capture microdissection has enabled high-resolution transcript analysis of the proliferative stage of Arabidopsis endosperm development. The data generated provides a useful resource providing novel insight into early seed development, facilitating both identification of endosperm expressed and novel imprinted genes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="subject">Angiosperms</field><field name="subject">genetic transformation</field><field name="subject">seeds</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080703.113233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural controls on orogenic gold mineralisation in the Otago Schist, New Zealand and the Klondike Schist, Canada</field><field name="creator">MacKenzie, Douglas James</field><field name="description">Orogenic gold mineralisation in schist terranes with few or no contemporaneous igneous intrusions is poorly understood. It is proposed in this thesis that the structural evolution of such terranes controls the generation of hydrothermal fluid pathways and thus the location of orogenic mineral deposits. Gold mineralisation in the Otago Schist, New Zealand and the Klondike Schist, Canada occurred in the latter phases of greenschist facies metamorphism as well as after metamorphism during Paleozoic-Mesozoic exhumation. In Otago, gold mineralisation occurred at a number of different times and structural levels as the schist belt was exhumed and rocks were brought up through the brittle-ductile transition. In Klondike Schist, gold mineralisation occurred in relatively brittle rocks after a period of regional compression and crustal shortening caused by the stacking of thrust sheets. Gold mineralisation in both schist belts is not associated with any coeval igneous activity. 
 The earliest stage of gold mineralisation in the Otago Schist occurred in the Jurassic when mineralising fluids were progressively focussed into late metamorphic ductile shear zones such as the Hyde-Macraes Shear Zone (HMSZ), east Otago and Rise and Shine Shear Zone (RSSZ), central Otago. Both of these gold-bearing mineralised zones occur along mappable structural discontinuities or boundaries that separate structurally, metamorphically and lithologically distinct blocks. The HMSZ occurs in the hangingwall of an underlying low angle normal fault that juxtaposes mineralised lower greenschist facies rocks on to unmineralised upper greenschist facies rock. The RSSZ occurs in the footwall of an overlying low angle normal fault that juxtaposes unmineralised lower greenschist facies rocks on to mineralised upper greenschist facies rock. The two shear zones did not form as part of a single homogeneous structure. There are several other prospective late metamorphic boundaries that are different from later brittle faults that disrupt the schist. Late metamorphic gold mineralisation is characterised by both ductile and brittle structures, foliation-parallel shears, disseminated gold with sulphides in deformed schist and minor steeply dipping extensional veins. This style of mineralisation is the most prospective but can be subtle in areas without quartz veins. Hydrothermally altered rocks are enriched in gold, arsenic, tungsten and sulphur with minor enrichment of bismuth, antimony, mercury and molybdenum. Disseminated mineralisation in the HMSZ is associated with hydrothermal graphite however there is no hydrothermal graphite in the RSSZ. 
 The next stage of gold mineralisation occurred in the Cretaceous during post-metamorphic exhumation of the schist belt and is characterised by steeply dipping, fault-controlled quartz veins, silicified breccias and negligible wall rock alteration. Most post-metamorphic veins strike northwest such as the ~25 km long Taieri river gold vein swarm, but there are other stibnite and gold mineralised structures that strike northeast (e.g., Manuherikia Fault system) and east-west (e.g., Old Man Range vein systems). The latest recognised stage of gold mineralisation is controlled by structures related to the initiation of the Alpine Fault in the Miocene and is characterised by steeply dipping quartz veins with abundant ankeritic carbonate in veins and ankeritic carbonate with gold in altered rocks. Hydrothermally altered rocks are enriched in arsenic, carbon dioxide and sulphur with minor enrichment of antimony. Gold-bearing veins at Bullendale, central Otago are of this type and are associated with a broad alteration zone. 
 Gold-silver and gold-silver-mercury alloys occur in both Caples and Torlesse Terranes of the Otago Schist. Almost all mercury-bearing gold occurs in east Otago vein systems and mercury-free gold occurs in central and northwest Otago veins, irrespective of host terrane. There is no relationship between depth of vein emplacement and mercury content of gold. 
 The Klondike Schist was emplaced as a series of stacked thrust slices in the Jurassic and thrust-related fabrics are preserved in all thrust slices. Strongly deformed carbonaceous schist horizons are spatially associated with thrust faults and graphite within these units is concentrated along spaced cleavage surfaces. Kink folding is best developed in the uppermost slices of Klondike Schist and overprints thrust-related fabrics. Gold-bearing veins formed in extension fractures controlled principally by pre-existing weaknesses such as kink fold axial surfaces. Normal faults correlated with a period of Late Cretaceous regional extension crosscut kink folds and offset gold mineralised veins. The main stage of mineralisation occurred after major regional compression and thrust stacking and before Cretaceous normal faulting. Gold-bearing veins are widely dispersed throughout the uppermost slices of Klondike Schist and are considered to be a sufficient source for Klondike gold placer deposits. 
 Disseminated gold with pyrite is associated with gold-bearing veins in some Klondike Schist and this disseminated mineralisation expands the exploration target for these veins. Disseminated gold with pyrite, without quartz veins, occurs in some schist lithologies and is associated with chlorite alteration and weak silicification. The arsenic content of gold-mineralised Klondike Schist is much lower than mineralised Otago Schist and background concentrations of arsenic are much lower in Klondike Schist as well. No shear-related mineralisation has been discovered in Klondike Schist but due to its relatively poor exposure, this belt remains prospective for this style of mineralisation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">schists</field><field name="subject">gold ores</field><field name="subject">orogeny</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">Yukon</field><field name="subject">Klondike River Valley</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080704.085108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The photoprotective xanthophyll cycle in Southern Ocean phytoplankton and Antarctic sea-ice algae</field><field name="creator">Griffith, Gary P</field><field name="description">When light intensities become supersaturating for photosynthesis, phytoplankton must be able to protect the photosynthetic machinery from potential damage by excess energy absorption. One of the most important photoprotective mechanisms involves the nonradiative dissipation of excess light energy by the interconversion of the carotenoid pigments of the so-called xanthophyll cycle. Very little is known about how the xanthophyll cycle of natural communities of phytoplankton responds to high light conditions and the relationship of this photoprotective mechanism to the surrounding physical environment. The purpose of this thesis was to examine the functioning, activation and relationship to the physical environment of the xanthophyll cycle in phytoplankton from the Antarctic ecosystem and the Southern Ocean. Experiments in Antarctica were conducted in austral spring under various natural and artificial light regimes including the use of a newly developed light mixing simulator (LMS). Photoprotective carotenoid pigment concentrations were determined using a carotenoid specific protocol for High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The photoprotective xanthophyll cycle was not active in Antarctic sea ice algae under the low light conditions under the annual sea ice. When sea ice algae are exposed to high irradiance, there was an initial rapid deepoxidation of the xanthophyll pigment diadinoxanthin (DD) to diatoxanthin (DT). With on-going irradiance exposure, slower deepoxidation of DD continued. The recovery of DD in the dark or under low light was found to be significantly faster than in temperate algal communities, and is likely a particular adaptation to the unique light environment in Antarctica. The temporal accumulation of pigments of the violaxanthin (VX) xanthophyll cycle was observed for the first time in a natural phytoplankton population. It is hypothesized that the VX cycle may function as a pathway to maintain the pool of DD cycle pigments rather than as a separate photoprotective pathway as observed in higher plants. The high irradiances of ultraviolet - B (290 - 320 nm) radiation (UVB) as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion over Antarctica in spring was found to significantly impact on the DD cycle. Exposure to high levels of both ultraviolet-A (320- 400 nm) radiation (UVA) and UVB reduced the photoprotective xanthophyll pigment pool with the greatest reduction occurring after exposure to high levels of UVB. The reduction in the amount of cellular DD after exposure to high levels of UVB was greater than can be explained by deepoxidation activity, which implies that high UVB exposure can lead to a loss of DD from the community. The first-order kinetic rates of the DD cycle were found to be similar to other studies and did not vary with light intensity. Simulations under natural light using the LMS demonstrated that the response of the DD cycle to static in situ incubations and when subject to vertical mixing was not similar, and that static incubations overestimate DD-cycle activity Over the long term, algae in a simulated vertically mixed environment were able to increase the pool of xanthophyll pigments compared to static conditions where the pool remained the same or decreased. Oceanographic observations from the subantarctic waters south-east of New Zealand in austral autumn provided the physical background for new insights into the xanthophyll cycle of Southern Ocean phytoplankton. The circulation flow and water masses between the Bounty Plateau and Bollons Seamount was resolved and shown to differ from numerical models. Relatively little of the warm and salty Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) from the Tasman Sea is carried in the flow of the Subantarctic Front (SAF). The spatial distribution of photoprotective xanthophyll pigments showed higher than expected concentrations in the surface mixed layer of the region. The high concentration of photoprotective pigments is considered to be a consequence of the low iron concentrations in southern waters and the highly variable light and vertical mixing environment. The high cellular concentrations of photoprotective pigments constrains photosynthetic activity implying that the photoprotective pigments may play a more significant role in controlling phytoplankton production in the Southern Ocean than previously thought. Analysis of the xanthophyll pigments and physical oceanography with a Self-Organising map (SOM) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) showed that the photophysiological index DT/ (DD+DT) can be used to resolve a change in water type properties. A simple numerical model was developed which can be used to provide a quantitative index of the relative magnitudes of vertical mixing and phytoplankton photoprotection in the water column. This approach may be useful to identify the effects of physical changes in the surface mixed layer of the Southern Ocean as predicted by climate change modelling.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">xanthophylls</field><field name="subject">phytoplankton</field><field name="subject">marine algae</field><field name="subject">sea ice</field><field name="subject">Antarctic Ocean</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080704.111758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of electronic structure calculations to atmospheric trace species</field><field name="creator">Lane, Joseph Robert</field><field name="description">The chemistry and dynamics of our atmosphere are complex and diverse. A plethora of different chemical reactions are thought to be important, of which only some are known, and even less are well understood. Many of these atmospheric reactions involve highly reactive or unstable trace species, which can be difficult to study experimentally. However, the advancement of computational methods and hardware now make it possible to investigate these chemical species theoretically to an accuracy that is useful for atmospheric chemistry. In this thesis, we have applied modern electronic structure methods to some prototypical hydrogen bonded complexes and sulfonic acid derivatives to better understand the roles of these trace species in the atmosphere. We have calculated fundamental and overtone vibrational spectra, electronic absorption spectra, and reaction energetics with high level ab initio methods.

The symbiosis island ICEMlSym[R7A] of Mesorhizobium loti strain R7A is the largest known mobile ICE (502 kb) and confers the ability to form a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with plants of the genus Lotus. 
 Transfer of ICEMlSym[R7A] to non-symbiotic bacteria has been demonstrated both in the laboratory and the environment and involves chromosomal integration of ICEMlSym[R7A] adjacent to the phe-tRNA gene in the recipient bacterium. Integration of ICEMlSym[R7A] requires the ICEMlSym[R7A]-encoded protein IntS which likely catalyses recombination between the attachment sites attP and attB, present on excised ICEMlSym[R7A] and phe-tRNA gene respectively. In this study it was shown that intS was required for both excision and integration and was required in both the donor and recipient bacterium for efficient transfer. A minimal attP region required for integration was defined and a repetitive sequence motif that likely represents the IntS-binding sequence identified. intS is expressed from two alternate promoters, a weak promoter on attL (left ICEMlSym[R7A]-chromosome junction) and a strong promoter formed on attP. Analysis of nested deletions of the attP region demonstrated that an unusually large region of attP, corresponding to that required for integration, was required for full gene expression. 
 A novel recombination directionality factor RdfS was identified using bioinformatics. A quantitative PCR assay developed to detect the presence of excised ICEMlSym[R7A] in bacterial populations showed that excision of ICEMlSym[R7A] was almost undetectable in an rdfS mutant. Constitutive expression of rdfS resulted in curing of ICEMlSym[R7A] from R7A, creating a non-symbiotic derivative R7ANS. 
 Bioinformatic analyses of rdfS and associated genes on ICEMlSym[R7A] led to discovery of 26 putative ICEs (ICESym family) in 12 &#945;-proteobacterial species. The ICESym clusters contained homologues of up to 25 ICEMlSym[R7A] proteins, encoding functions involved in mating pore formation, DNA processing and regulation, of which 17 proteins were universally conserved. 
 Introduction of pJR174 containing a copy of the ICEMlSym[R7A]-encoded quorum sensing (QS) gene traR induced excision in 100% of cells and stimulated a 100-fold increase in ICEMlSym[R7A] transfer. Stable maintenance of ICEMlSym[R7A] in these cells required the DNA relaxase-encoding gene rlxS. Introduction of pJR174 also induced a 1000-fold increase in the production of 3-oxo-C6-homoserine lactone and several other acyl homoserine lactones; this induction required traI1. The induction of QS was accompanied by various growth-inhibitory effects, similar to those observed in other rhizobial QS systems. 
 The QS system activated ICEMlSym[R7A] excision through expression of msi172 and msi171, genes that are downstream of QS gene traI2. Expression of the adjacent gene msi170 separately repressed both QS and excision. The expression of msi170 was negatively regulated by Msi169, while msi169 was positively autoregulated. msi169 encodes an Xre family DNA-binding protein and homologues of it were identified on the ICESym clusters and on QS-regulated plasmids, suggesting that they have a conserved role as regulators of transfer- and QS-related genes. Overall, the results suggest that ICEMlSym[R7A] excision and transfer are subject to both population-density and cell-cycle-dependent regulation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lotus</field><field name="subject">molecular genetics</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080709.100706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical aggression among high school students in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Marsh, Louise</field><field name="description">Recent New Zealand (NZ) research found rates of physical fighting and weapon carrying among high school students in Dunedin were equal to that of rates for the United States (US). The NZ Government has identified violence as a priority health issue. However, NZ is lacking information on the prevalence of the problem, and the identification of factors which may provide clues for prevention. The current understanding of the social context in which physical aggression takes place, has focused on risk factors that are present in the adolescents&#65533; ecological frame. Emerging protective factors are increasingly being recognised as major determinants that can moderate the adverse effects of risk factors. However, little research into protective factors has been conducted in NZ. 
 The aim of this thesis was to investigate physical aggression among adolescents in NZ. This was explored through four in-depth studies: i) a national survey of secondary school principals and counsellors ii) focus groups with students in Otago; iii) an online survey with students in Otago and iv) a survey with teachers in Otago. 
 The national survey of secondary school principals and counsellors points to a degree of concern about physical violence in NZ. One in ten reported fights occurred frequently, and over a quarter of principals and over one third of counsellors reported that at least one student at their school had been caught carrying a weapon. 
 Focus groups with Otago adolescents indicated that fights often began as verbal disagreements escalating to physical fights, that a fight should be defined as serious as opposed to a play fight; and differences were also found between fighting at school and outside of school. Participants suggested that items may be reported as weapons, even though they are not being carried for such purposes. Previous estimates of aggressive behaviours may have been unjustifiably high and possibly hid signifcant differences in the nature of the aggression being reported. 
 A quantitative cross-sectional online survey was undertaken with Otago secondary school students, and confirmed that physical aggression among NZ adolescents is a significant problem. Mutivariate analyses identified the school as an important factor in the social system of adolescents; in particular feeling safe, not feeling alienated and being treated fairly. The results highlighted the need to concentrate on strategies that improve students&#65533; positive engagement with school as a means to reduce physical aggression. 
 The final study of Otago secondary school teachers showed that while teachers did not consider physical aggression as a major problem in their schools, they did report frequent occurrences of physical fighting. Respondents also reported some teachers experienced significant physical aggression from students. 
 Physical aggression among NZ adolescents is a significant public health problem that needs addressing. This behaviour impacts directly on the education offered to students, the safety of the environment in which learning takes place, and the stress of the work place for teachers. This thesis has identified school engagement as the most promising protective factors for young people against involvement in physical aggression.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">aggressiveness in adolescence</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080710.115418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adding to nature : can artificial retreats be used to monitor and restore lizard populations?</field><field name="creator">Lettink, Marieke</field><field name="description">Artificial retreats are increasingly used to sample animal populations and in attempts to boost animal numbers in degraded habitats. Here, I test potential applications of artificial retreats for lizards inhabiting a coastal environment of high conservation value (Kaitorete Spit, New Zealand). I first conducted a pitfall-trapping survey examining the distribution and relative abundance of lizards in duneland, farmland and shrubland habitats, and tested the influence of trap placement on capture rates. Capture rates of the diurnal skinks Oligosoma maccanni (McCann&#65533;s skink) and O. nigriplantare polychroma (common skink) were highest in duneland and farmland, respectively, and were most sensitive to the distance separating traps from the nearest cover (the greater the distance, the lower the capture rate). Captures of O. lineoocellatum (spotted skink) and Hoplodactylus maculatus (common gecko) were rare. 
 Secondly, in separate chapters I test the utility of artificial retreats for monitoring: 1) a preference trial examining relative use of three types of artificial retreats by skinks (O. maccanni and O. n. polychroma) and geckos (H. maculatus); 2) a comparison of the effectiveness of artificial retreats relative to pitfall traps for detecting cryptic and primarily nocturnal geckos (H. maculatus) following translocation; and 3) capture-recapture estimation of population parameters (survival and abundance) of H. maculatus. I found that: 1) geckos strongly preferred retreats made of Onduline over corrugated iron and concrete tiles, whereas skinks exhibited no apparent preferences; 2) artificial retreats were more effective than pitfall traps for detecting geckos following translocation; and 3) monthly survival and recapture probabilities of geckos varied with age-class and over time. Estimated survival was unexpectedly low, possibly due to excessive trap spacing. I developed a new capture-recapture model specifically for population size estimation with data from artificial retreats, which gave estimates that were up to 50% greater than those predicted by conventional capture-recapture models. I caution that permanent placement of artificial retreats in long-term studies may be inappropriate for estimation of population parameters due to potential habitat-enhancement effects and/or altered predation risk. 
 Thirdly, I conducted a capture-recapture field experiment, using a replicated Before-After-Control-impact (BACI) design, to test the relative effects of habitat manipulation (artificial retreat addition) and partial predator removal (by fencing) on annual survival of duneland skink (O. maccanni) populations. Survival increased at sites with predator exclosures, but not at control sites or following the addition of artificial retreats, either alone or in combination with a predator exclosure. The magnitude of the increase in survival for the exclosure-only treatment was small, but sufficient to change the trajectory of an apparently stable population into an increasing one, suggesting that the population is limited by predators. Predator control, but not the addition of artificial retreats, is predicted to benefit O. maccanni. 
 To conclude, the Onduline design developed here appears to be particularly useful for sampling cryptic, terrestrial geckos; however, artificial retreats must be used appropriately to avoid bias arising from habitat-enhancing effects and/or altered predation risk. The restoration value of artificial retreats requires further testing on other species and in areas where natural retreat sites are limited.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lizards</field><field name="subject">skinks</field><field name="subject">geckos</field><field name="subject">habitations</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">reptile populations</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Kaitorete Spit</field><field name="subject">McCann's skink</field><field name="subject">Hoplodactylus maculatus</field><field name="subject">Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma</field><field name="subject">Oligosoma lineoocellatum</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080715.091040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of very prolonged and sustained exercise</field><field name="creator">Lucas, Samuel John Edwin</field><field name="description">Little is known about the strain and consequences of very prolonged and sustained exercise lasting multiple days. This thesis comprises two multi-day exercise field studies and a 24-h, controlled-trial field/laboratory study. The field studies were undertaken using international adventure races (2003 and 2004 Southern Traverses: 86-120 h) to profile exercise intensity and associated physiological and psychophysical strain, and physical and cognitive performance. The 2003 study showed that exercise intensity (from heart rate range) averaged 64% during the first 12 h, dropped to 41% by 24 h, and remained so thereafter. Body core temperature (gastrointestinal pills), throughout racing (n=8) was relatively stable (min 36.0&#65533;C and only briefly &gt;39&#65533;C), despite widely varying endogenous and exogenous thermal stress. Blood samples obtained before (n=34), during (n=11) and after (n=34) racing revealed a large plasma volume expansion (24%), with stable [sodium]plasma (n=6). Acute (15-30 h) and chronic (96-120 h) elevation of neutrophil, monocyte and lymphocyte numbers were observed across the race. Standardised exercise tests (rest, 25 and 50% peak power output (PPO)) before and after racing (n=9) revealed an extreme shift toward fat utilisation, consistent with lowered fat mass (11%; n=44) and high [free fatty acids]plasma (up 370%; n=9) at race-finish, although [HAD]muscle was unchanged. Muscle glycogen was only 50% lower post-race (290 nmol&#65533;kg&#8315;&#65533;d.w.). Complex cognitive performance (Stroop test) impairment was attenuated during 50% PPO post-race. Perceived exertion uncoupled from HR at standardised workloads. Explosive power (jump test; n=24) and anaerobic power (30-s Wingate; n=27) were modestly (&lt;10%) impacted. Strength reduction of arms (11%) and legs (17%) was equivalent (p=0.17). The 2004 study (n=4) involved dissimilar terrain, vegetation, and sequence of exercise modes, yet the profile of exercise intensity was similar: first 12 h 65%, then 45% by 24 h and thereafter. Thus, athletes reliably attain sustainable, low-to-moderate exercise intensity by 24 h. Plasma volume, neutrophil and monocyte responses were reliable across races, whereas lymphocytes were not. Plasma [IL-6] and [S100&#946;] were elevated, substantially in some individuals (IL-6: 223 pg&#65533;mL&#8315;&#65533;; S100&#946;: 113 pg&#65533;mL&#8315;&#65533;), during racing. A 24-h adventure race simulation (n=9) was then undertaken to investigate physiological and psychophysical factors influencing exercise intensity, autonomic function and orthostatic tolerance. Tests were at 0, ~7, ~15 and 24 h. The 24-h HR profile matched that observed during racing: first 12 h 58% (including 3-h testing), remainder 41%. The shift toward fat utilisation was almost complete within 7 h, and similar to that following 2003 race. The perceived exertion-to-HR uncoupling was also similar; being complete within 15 h. Plasma [noradrenaline] for rest and 12-km&#65533;h&#8315;&#65533; run was elevated post-simulation. Plasma [IL-6] peaked by 7 h, although not as high as field observations. The timeframe of metabolic change and perceived exertion uncoupling coincided with that of pace reduction, and may be important regulatory components of very prolonged exercise intensity. Orthostatic intolerance was evident during the simulation (n=6/9), as was cerebral hypo-perfusion (15 h &amp; 24 h). Autonomic function (baroreflex sensitivity, sympathetic activation, parasympathetic withdrawal) was altered only at 7 h, whereas postural-induced hypotension (via impaired venous response) and hypocapnia were always present.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Southern Traverse (Race)</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">energy metabolism</field><field name="subject">endurance sports</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080716.142609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poetic brandscapes</field><field name="creator">Wijland, Roel</field><field name="description">&#65533;Every poet who takes language seriously is working against a culture of clear marketable meanings and commodified production&#65533; states New Zealand novelist, essayist and poet Gregory O&#65533;Brien. This statement is the motivation for research that is explored in a collaborative ethnographic study of brand culture perceptions in New Zealand. It takes its inspiration from The Poetics of Space (Bachelard, 1978) and provides intimate lyrical insights into the experience of brands and brandscapes. 
 Gregory O&#65533;Brien describes the artists that inspire him as: &#65533;Those who resolutely stand on their own creative terms, working towards their own objectives, as oblivious as they can be to any market forces.&#65533; O&#65533;Brien&#65533;s observations are relevant to the research project in two essential ways: first to cast light on a shared cultural commodity construct such as a brand from its proposed opposite cultural site of individual imagination and secondly, to accept the poetic in the form of the undiluted voice of vocational poets as valuable media in their own right to achieve insightful interpretations. Critical marketing projects have the duty to generate an alternative &#65533;marketing gaze&#65533; sufficient to the task of &#65533;revelation&#65533; (Brownile &amp; Hewer, 2007). With regards to individual artists and poets specifically, critical marketing concepts implicitly pose the main research question as to the scenarios that are conceivably available to consumers: how does &#65533;working against marketable meanings&#65533; imaginatively work? 
 The project proposes the new construct of co-imagination as the co-active mental and spiritual engagement of consumers with the cultural artefacts of brandscapes that invite individual meaning making. It substantiates this individuality in a poetic evocation of brandscapes by thirteen artists. It analyses the holistic imaginative process on the basis of mental models, strategic scenarios and evocative aesthetics, in order to assess how talented consumers work against marketable meaning. It subsequently offers the relationship of co-imagination with existing co-optive concepts in marketing, literature and consumer behaviour, such as co-creation (Prahalad &amp; Ramaswamy, 2004), co-performance (Deighton, 1992) and co-duction (Booth, 1988). It results in a collaborative artistic inquiry that assembles individual evocations of enchantment and disenchantment with the beauty and ugliness of brandscapes, through newly created poetry. The research introduces the new concepts of aesthetic scarcity and aesthetic community and in its collaborative method of inquiry offers an alternative to a poetic tradition in consumer behaviour of the poet / researcher conflation (Sherry &amp; Schouten, 2002). As a result, the project complements the understanding of the individual meaning-making process in brand culture and is relevant to both practitioners and researchers in consumer behaviour and brand strategy. 
 The design of the project included a four month research journey that covered the North and the South Island of New Zealand with the objective of meeting a variety of poets in their local inspirational environments and brandscapes and catalyse an unusual creative cooperation of highly individual radical artists. In the thick description and analyses of the extensive field research, the project implicitly adds to existing work on brand culture (Schroeder, Salzer Morling, &amp; Askegaard, 2006), brand aesthetics (Saizer-Mo&#776;rling &amp; Strannega&#778;rd, 2004) and the relationship between artists and brands (Schroeder, 2005). 
 The research includes design elements based on romantic pragmatism (Rorty, 2007a) and cognitive aesthetics (R. H. Brown, 1977), both post-romantic concepts that explore aesthetic perception as perspectival knowledge and aesthetic distance as a means to transcend the dichotomy of objectivity and subjectivity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">brand name products</field><field name="subject">poets</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080716.144516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immunostimulatory lipid implants as delivery systems for model antigen</field><field name="creator">Myschik, Julia</field><field name="description">Aim: Subunit vaccines have received increasing attention due to their good safety profile. However, subunit vaccines feature low immunogenicity, and soluble antigen is largely ignored by the immune system due to its lack of danger signals. To stimulate an appropriate immune response, subunit antigen vaccines require the addition of an adjuvant and multiple administrations. This study aimed to formulate biodegradable lipid implants, containing a suitable adjuvant, which delivers antigen in a sustained manner. The physico-chemical characteristics of the implants and their ability to stimulate immune responses towards a model antigen in vivo were investigated. 
 Methods: Lipid implants were prepared from phospholipid and cholesterol. Different adjuvants were added, and their potential to induce an immune response to the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) was investigated. The adjuvants and immunomodulators assessed were Quil-A (QA), imiquimod, and an &#945;-Galactosylceramide (&#945;-GalCer) analogue. Liposomal dispersions were prepared using the lipid film hydration method. These were freeze-dried, and the powder compressed into matrices (diameter of 2 mm). Physico-chemical characterisation was undertaken by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the release of colloidal structures (liposomes, immunostimulating complexes [ISCOMs]) upon hydration with release media. Surface changes of the implant matrices were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The release of the fluorescently-labelled antigen ovalbumin (FITC-OVA) and its entrapment into the colloidal particles was investigated using spectrofluorophotometry. Additionally, incorporation of the cationic cholesterol derivative DC-cholesterol (DCCHOL) into implants to allow for charge-charge interactions with the negatively-charged OVA, and replacement of the phospholipid with a phospholipid having a higher transition temperature to facilitate the manufacturing process, were attempted and assessed. The immune response stimulated towards OVA released from the implants was analysed in vivo using a C57Bl/6 mouse model. Expansion of CD8&#8314; T cells and CD8 T cells specific for the CD8 epitope of OVA (SIINFEKL), as well as expansion of CD4&#8314; T cells, were assessed. The ability of implants to stimulate T cell proliferation and interferon-&#947; production after in vitro restimulation with OVA was analysed. Serum samples were analysed for OVA-specific IgG antibodies. 
 Results: Lipid implants containing Quil-A released colloidal structures upon hydration with buffer. The type of colloids observed by TEM depended on the ratio of QA:cholesterol:phospholipid. Release of OVA was sustained over ten days in implants prepared with egg yolk PC. However, the release kinetics depended strongly on the choice of phospholipid. In vivo, lipid implants containing Quil-A evoked expansion of CD8&#8314; T cells. The immune response to one implant was comparable to that obtained by two equivalent injection immunisations. Therefore, the implants obviated the need for multiple immunisations in the vaccination regime tested here. Expansion of CD8&#8314; T cells towards the Quil-A-containing implant was greater than that achieved by the immunomodulators imiquimod and the &#945;-GalCer analogue. Quil-A-containing implants produced OVA-specific IgG antibodies to a greater extent than the implants containing imiquimod or &#945;-GalCer. Incorporation of the cationic DCCHOL did not increase the entrapment efficiency of OVA into liposomes. However, the in vivo investigation of DCCHOL-containirig implants showed an adjuvant effect of DCCHOL on antibody responses, but not on cell-mediated immunity. 
 Conclusion: Lipid implants offer great potential as sustained release vaccine delivery systems. The lipid components in the implant formulation were well-tolerated and biodegradable. Lipid implants combine the advantages of sustained release of antigen and particulate delivery by the formation of colloidal particles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lipids</field><field name="subject">physiological transport</field><field name="subject">immunological adjuvants</field><field name="subject">mechanism of action</field><field name="subject">drug delivery systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080806.114447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Belonging knows no boundaries : persisting land tenure custom for Shona, Ndebele and Ngai Tahu</field><field name="creator">Goodwin, David Pell</field><field name="description">Aspects of customary land tenure may survive even where formal rules in a society supersede custom. This thesis is about persisting custom for Maori Freehold land (MFL) in New Zealand, and the Communal Areas (CAs) of Zimbabwe. Three questions are addressed: what unwritten land tenure custom still persists for Ngai Tahu, Shona and Ndebele, what key historical processes and events in New Zealand and Zimbabwe shaped the relationship between people and land into the form it displays today, and how do we explain differences between surviving customary tenure practices in the two countries? The research was based on in-depth interviews. 
 A key difference between the two countries was found to lie in the type and degree of security available over the years to Maori and Shona/Ndebele. Roots of security were found in the substance of the founding treaties and concessions, and thereafter in a variety of other factors including the help (or lack of it) offered by the law in redressing grievances, the level of intermarriage between settler and autochthon, the differing security of land rights offered in urban centres in the respective countries, demographic factors and the availability of state benefits. This research finds that greater security was offered to Maori than to Shona and Ndebele, and that this has reduced the centrality of customary practices with regard to land. 
 The research found that, in Zimbabwe, tenure security in the CAs is still underwritten by communities and that significant investment is still made in both living and dead members of those communities. Another finding is that land custom has adapted dynamically to meet new challenges, such as urban land and CA land sales. In New Zealand, investment in groups that jointly hold rights in MFL has, to some extent been eclipsed by the payment of rates and the availability of services (e.g. state-maintained boundary records and law enforcement mechanisms) and of benefits (e.g. superannuation, disability and unemployment). Land and community are not as closely linked to survival as they were in the past and, for many, they have come to hold largely symbolic value and less practical significance. Overall, it is the pursuit of security and &#65533;belonging&#65533; that have been the greatest influences on customary land tenure practices in the long term.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shona (African people)</field><field name="subject">Ndebele (African people)</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Ngai Tahu (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">customary law</field><field name="subject">Zimbabwe</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080807.151921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transformation of Alexander&#65533;s court : the kingship, royal insignia and eastern court personnel of Alexander the Great</field><field name="creator">Collins, Andrew William</field><field name="description">This thesis examines Alexander&#65533;s conception of kingship, his relationship with royal traditions in the three great kingdoms of the Near East, and the concomitant transformation of the king&#65533;s court by which Alexander created a distinctive royal insignia and introduced new court personnel and protocol. Section I ("Alexander and Near Eastern Kingship") contains Chapters I, II, and III. Section II ("The Transformation") comprises Chapters IV to VI. In Chapter I, I examine the Macedonian background of Alexander&#65533;s court and his native conception of kingship. Chapter II is a study of the kingship of Egypt. Chapter III deals with the kingship of Babylon and Persia. I then turn to an analysis of Alexander&#65533;s policies towards the Persians and the concept of the "kingship of Asia," as this was understood by Alexander. This crucial concept is to be distinguished from the kingship of Persia, a position which Alexander supplanted and replaced with his personal kingship of Asia. In Section II, three chapters are devoted to an analysis of the transformation of Alexander&#65533;s court. Chapter IV covers the origin and significance of Alexander&#65533;s royal insignia. Chapter V examines the introduction of, and the role played by, Persians and easterners in the king&#65533;s court; and Chapter VI the significance of other Persian court offices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.)</field><field name="subject">Greece</field><field name="subject">Macedonian Expansion 359-323 B.C.</field><field name="subject">regalia (insignia)</field><field name="subject">ancient kings and rulers</field><field name="subject">courts and courtiers</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080811.093142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrophysiological effects in the rat basal ganglia following systemic adenosine A2A receptor stimulation and dopamine D2 receptor blockade</field><field name="creator">Voicu, Cristian</field><field name="description">The difficulty with movement initiation, or akinesia, is a cardinal symptom of Parkinson&#65533;s disease (PD) and the loss of dopaminergic cells, affecting the function of the basal ganglia, the thalamus and the motor cortex, has long been documented. From a broader perspective, it has been proposed that akinesia is caused by impaired function in different brain areas, inside and outside the basal ganglia, operating as a &#65533;behavioural arrest control system&#65533; (Klemm, 2001). Several neurotransmitters seem to modulate the activity of this system and, contrasting the well-known effects of dopamine, the involvement of adenosine has only recently emerged, particularly via A2A receptors. Adenosine plays an opposite role to dopamine in the brain: adenosine stimulation at A2A receptors inhibits movement (Ferre et al., 1991a; Hauber and Munkle, 1995; Rimondini et al., 1997), whereas A2A antagonists seem to promote movement (Kanda et al., 2000; Bara-Jimenez et al., 2003; Pinna et al., 2005). Although specific adenosine A2A and dopamine D2 receptors are known to antagonistically interact (Ferre et al., 1997; Fuxe et al., 1998; Ferre et al., 2001), little is known of the involvement of A2A receptors in regulating neural activity in the basal ganglia, a crucial point for the future use of A2A antagonists as adjuvant therapy in Parkinson&#65533;s disease. In fact, although it is generally accepted that akinesia results from altered function in the cortico-basal ganglia-cortical loop, as confirmed in several studies reporting changes in basal ganglia activity following dopamine depletion (Blandini et al., 2000; Bevan et al., 2002; Boraud et al., 2002), no study to date has systematically investigated electrophysiological changes in the basal ganglia during akinesia induced by adenosine receptor stimulation. 
 Starting from a common behavioural effect, this study tries to bridge this gap by investigating and comparing, in two basal ganglia structures, the neural substrate of akinesia after acute dopamine D2 receptor blockade and adenosine A2A receptor stimulation. The external segment of the globus pallidus (GP, or simply globus pallidus in the rat) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) were chosen as the recording sites because both nuclei are included into the &#65533;behavioural arrest control system&#65533; and seem to express somewhat complementary functions, as a respective key integrative station and main output of the basal ganglia. Dopamine function was manipulated by acute decrease in availability of dopamine binding sites in the brain, through specific dopamine D2 receptor blockade with systemic injections (1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg) of raclopride(3,5-dichloro-N-[(1-ethylpyrrolidin-2-y)methyl]-2-hydroxy-6-methoxy-benzamide), resulting in akinesia. Conversely, movement was inhibited by specific adenosine A2A receptor stimulation with systemic injections (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) of the drug CGS21680 (sodium-2-p-carboxyethylphenylamino-5-N-carboxamidoadenosine). In both situations, behaviour was assessed through specific akinesia tests. Single neuron activity before injection and changes in the firing frequency and firing pattern occurring after injection have been analysed and compared for each cell recorded from GP and SNr, during periods of behavioural rest. Synchronised firing between cell pairs has also been assessed. However, the small number of cell pairs showing correlated firing in each structure after systemic injection of drugs was not statistically relevant for further analysis and interpretation of synchronised firing during drug induced akinesia. In our experiments, both drugs inhibited movement, albeit somewhat differently, with lack of rigidity and &#65533;flat&#65533; body position after adenosine stimulation. Dopamine blockade decreased mean firing rate and dramatically altered the firing pattern in both investigated structures, generally increasing burst activity (increased percentage of spikes in bursts, mean number of bursts, mean number of spikes per burst, mean intra-burst firing frequency) and decreasing regularity of firing (increased coefficient of variation of the inter-spike intervals). Increased burst activity in the rat basal ganglia in an acute model of parkinsonian akinesia, following systemic raclopride injections, confirmed the importance of changes in the firing pattern in PD. The only electrophysiological effect of systemic A2A stimulation was decreased mean firing rate in the GP, a weak effect that could not propagate towards output stations of the basal ganglia. The lack of changes in the firing pattern, at both input and output levels of the basal ganglia, suggests a correlation with the lack of rigidity in adenosine-stimulation-induced akinesia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">basal ganglia</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">electrophysiology</field><field name="subject">adenosine</field><field name="subject">dopamine</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080811.155439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobile New Zealand : a multi-method comparative study of cell phone use</field><field name="creator">Broege, Stephanie</field><field name="description">Worldwide use of mobile phones has created a new basis for interpersonal communication and has become a ubiquitous feature of youth culture. Hence the examination of global mobile phone adoption is a global challenge for communication researchers as well as for the media industries. Thus far, New Media research in New Zealand (NZ) has focused on children and teenagers. The group of young adults between 18-25 years has rarely been surveyed. This thesis focused on university students&#65533; use of mobile communication in NZ in the context of their everyday practices. The Mobile Media Study (MMS) was designed as a cross-national comparative research project with a focus on NZ together with one European and one North American country. The usage behavior, experiences, attitudes, and opinions of young NZers&#65533; towards mobile phone use was examined and contrasted to young German and American students. Methodological and data triangulation was applied and data was collected at the University of Otago, the City University of New York, the Pennsylvania State University, and the University of Leipzig. MMS survey research was conducted along with focus group and personal interviews, and qualitative exercises. In addition, the latest data from a longitudinal study of New Media use in Germany, the US and NZ served as a secondary, comparative, and complementary dataset. 
 The research questions focused on general mobile phone use, text-messaging (SMS), the acceptance of Third Generation (3G) cell phones, mobile phone use in public places, gender-specific usages, and the construction of mobile social networks. Altogether, data from 1,316 students at four universities in three countries was analyzed. Results indicated that the number of providers as well as tariff structures appear to influence mobile phone adoption within a country. To adjust to the duopoly situation young people in NZ preferred prepaid cards in connection with a SMS package. This was reflected by extraordinarily high use of SMS in NZ. By comparison German and American students preferred annual contracts. Americans, who had the strongest preference for mobile calling, also had the highest monthly expenses. Additionally, findings revealed that overall user interest in 3G services is not yet very high. It was found that in particular NZ students do not exploit the full range of mobile services already available to them and feel confident that their current cell phone gratifies all their needs. They concentrate on using basic functions, such as calling and SMS. In addition, results suggest a decreasing role of the landline telephone and email for interpersonal communication. 
 Gender differences were found with NZ women in particular being most enthusiastic about SMS. German men had the most negative attitude toward SMS and also used the service the least in comparison to the other students surveyed. In general women had a preference for the communicative functions on their mobile phone including voicemail and more women than men in Germany and NZ were found to play mobile phone games. Finally, evidence of gender specific social network structures were found in NZ with male networks resembling spider webs while female networks were centered so that all persons in the network connected back to the center. Overall, students only used a fraction of the contacts in their mobile phone book and communicated mostly within a limited local area. In conclusion, a replication of the MMS was suggested along with further multi-method research in the field of Asian-NZer&#65533;s New Media use.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cellular telephones</field><field name="subject">telecommunication</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">social networks</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Germany</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080819.150246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The clinical anatomy of the anterior neck muscles</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Ewan</field><field name="description">The role of the anterior neck muscles in cervical dysfunction has become an area of interest in the physiotherapy literature, resulting in the development of new methods for assessing and treating dysfunction of these muscles. However, these methods are based primarily on electromyographic (EMG) and various imaging studies, and lack a detailed anatomical or biomechanical foundation. The purpose of this work was to examine the morphology and basic biomechanics of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM); scalenus anterior, medius, and posterior; longus capitis and colli; rectus capitis anterior and lateralis muscles with a view to better understanding the capabilities of these muscles. This will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of cervical disorders and inform more evidence based approaches to treatment. 
 This research was completed in three stages: dissection of the fascicular anatomy of the anterior neck muscles in embalmed cadavers; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of these muscles in young volunteers; and biomechanical modelling. Descriptive and morphological data from both the dissection and MRI studies were recorded, and cross-referenced for input into the biomechanical model. The biomechanical study involved calculating the peak force capabilities of each fascicle, and deriving the orientation and distribution of these forces across the cervical motion segments using CT scans. The result was a detailed breakdown of the peak torque, compression and shear forces generated by the anterior neck muscles at a fascicular level, calculated with reference to each cervical motion segment. 
 The dissection study revealed several interesting findings regarding the structure of these muscles, adding considerable detail to anatomical textbook descriptions. Findings are described for each individual muscle. The MRI study found substantially larger muscle volumes than found in the dissection study, due to changes both with age and embalming. Biomechanical modelling demonstrated that in the neutral position the anterior neck muscles are not capable of exerting large forces, and do not act equally on all the cervical motion segments. Moment generating capacity into flexion was dominated by the SCM, and increased at lower levels in the cervical spine. All muscles were capable of producing compression, and total compression capacity remained relatively even at different cervical levels. Shear capacity was minimal, and was only potentially produced by the SCM in the lower cervical spine. 
 The anterior neck muscles are complex and interesting muscles for which textbook descriptions tend to be simplified. These muscles act closely on the cervical motion segments, producing largely compressive forces. The more deeply placed longus and scalene muscles demonstrated a limited capacity for producing flexion moments, especially compared to the SCM. At C2-3 the SCM produced a net extension moment, suggesting that at this level (and above) the longus capitis and colli may proportionally play a greater role in cervical flexion. However, the force capabilities of these muscles remain very small and may be insufficient to produce actions attributed to these muscles in the clinical literature. This research presents data fundamental to understanding the function of these muscles, and which has the potential to contribute towards many different biomechanical applications in future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neck</field><field name="subject">muscles</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080821.150929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reducing the negative effect of cross-examination questioning on the accuracy of children&#65533;s reports</field><field name="creator">Righarts, Saskia Anne</field><field name="description">A growing body of research suggests that cross-examination may be detrimental to the accuracy of children&#65533;s event reports. The primary goal of the present research was to investigate three specific ways in which the negative effect of cross-examination could be reduced. 
 Experiment 1 examined the effect of reducing the delay between the collection of the primary evidence and cross-examination. Five- and 6-year-old children (N = 76) took part in a staged event and were interviewed 1 to 2 days later. In this interview, children were asked to recall everything they could remember about the event. Children were then asked specific yes/no questions. Next, either 1 to 3 days or 8 months later, all children were interviewed for a second time in a cross-examination format. The 8-month delay was equivalent to the average delay experienced by children in New Zealand courts (Lash, 1995). The aim of the cross-examination interview was to talk the children out of their original responses, irrespective of the accuracy of their original account. Cross-examination questioning had a significant negative effect on the accuracy of children&#65533;s reports, regardless of timing. That is, children cross-examined soon after the memory event performed no better than those who were cross-examined after an 8-month delay. Furthermore, one week after cross-examination, children were interviewed again. The purpose of this interview was to establish whether children actually believed the responses they had given during cross-examination. During this interview, many children reversed what they had said during cross-examination, indicating that the responses they had given during cross-examination were due primarily to compliance to authority. 
 Given the finding that compliance to authority played a significant role in children&#65533;s cross-examination performance in Experiment 1, Experiment 2 addressed whether a pre-interview intervention aimed to decrease compliance would reduce the negative impact of cross-examination. Five- and 6-year-old children (n = 59) and 9- and 10-year-old children (n = 62) participated in the same staged event and were interviewed for their primary evidence as in Experiment 1. Prior to the cross-examination interview, however, some children were warned that the interviewer might ask some questions which were tricky and that it was okay to tell her that she was wrong. Warning children prior to the cross-examination interview did not reduce the negative impact of cross-examination for either age group, even when the warning was delivered by the cross-examining interviewer. 
 Experiment 3 addressed whether a more intensive pre-interview intervention could reduce the negative impact of cross-examination. Using the same experimental procedures as Experiment 2, half of the 5- and 6-year-old children (n = 77) and 9- and 10-year-old children (n = 87) received a practice and feedback session with cross-examination type questions prior to the target interview. While cross-examination still resulted in a decrease in children&#65533;s accuracy, children in the preparation condition performed significantly better than the control children. 
 Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the negative effect of cross-examination is highly robust and that compliance appears to be the underlying mechanism responsible for this. A practice and feedback session targeting the factors that contribute to compliance reduced, but did not eliminate, the negative effect of this questioning style. Therefore, children&#65533;s accuracy may be facilitated to some extent by cross-examination preparation prior to testifying.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child witnesses</field><field name="subject">cross-examination</field><field name="subject">compliance</field><field name="subject">authority</field><field name="subject">evidence (law)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080827.093855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening needs of distance learners : a case study of EAP learners at the University of the South Pacific</field><field name="creator">Chand, Rajni Kaushal</field><field name="description">This study focuses on student listening needs in the context of the English for Academic Purposes program taught by distance education at the University of the South Pacific. It explores the relationship between learners&#65533; awareness of the learning strategy they use for developing their listening skills and their teachers&#65533; knowledge of the strategy use and listening needs of learners. 
 Using an ethnographic case study approach, the study was conducted at various campuses and centres of the University of the South Pacific. Interviews were conducted with five EAP/study skills teachers, five subject/course teachers, 19 past learners and 10 present learners of the EAP/study skills course. Questionnaire data was also obtained from 19 past learners and 153 present learners. In addition, a course material analysis was carried out. 
 The study confirms and adds weight to the conclusions of earlier researchers such as Berne (1998), and Mendelsohn (2001) who explain that discrepancies exist between L2 listening research and practice. The findings of this research indicate that teachers differ from their learners in terms of learners&#65533; knowledge and understanding of listening skills and learning strategies in use. The findings also indicate that even though learning had taken place in this distance education context some face-to-face teaching would have been desirable. A combination of distance teaching with longer teacher-learner contact for distance teaching of listening skills is recommended, since regular contact between teachers and learners is seen by learners as very beneficial and more likely to lead to a better development of listening skills. It also helps create an awareness of learners&#65533; present and future listening needs. The nature of distance teaching at the University of the South Pacific, and the challenges faced by both teachers and learners are discussed in this study, and the requirement for further needs analysis in regard to distance EAP courses are noted. 
 The study concludes with recommendations for strategy training for distance learners as well as for raising teacher awareness about the importance of strategy teaching. It is also recommended that similar studies be undertaken in other language skills courses offered by distance at universities like USP such as reading, writing and speaking courses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">study and teaching (Higher)</field><field name="subject">foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">listening</field><field name="subject">distance education</field><field name="subject">Oceania</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080827.114047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of ethanol on the developing central nervous system : timing of neuronal cell death following ethanol exposure</field><field name="creator">Fowler, Anna-Kate</field><field name="description">This study assessed the consequences of a single binge exposure to ethanol on postnatal day (PN) 4 in the Purkinje cell population of the rat cerebellar vermis. The acute temporal pattern of apoptosis and the long-term permanent deficit in Purkinje cells across the entire vermis and on a lobular basis was investigated. It also investigated the lobular based Purkinje cell vulnerability to ethanol-induced apoptosis. 
 On PN4 Sprague-Dawley rat pups from timed matings were randomly assigned to either an alcohol exposed (AE; 4.5g/kg, 10.2% (v/v) as 2 doses 2 hours apart) via intragastric intubation, or sham intubated control (IC) group. Immunolabelling methods were used to detect active capase-3 in cerebellar vermal Purkinje cells hourly from 1 to 12 hours and 14, 16, 20, and 24 hours, following the first intubation. Semi-quantitative methods were used to determine the ratio of active caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, labelled Purkinje cells per total Purkinje cells within the entire cerebellar vermis and on a lobular basis. The onset of caspase-3 activation occurred 3-4 hours following the initial ethanol exposure and peaked 10 hours post-ethanol, the magnitude of increase in active caspase-3 varied across lobules. To determine the long-term consequences a second cohort of pups was treated as per above and the total number of Purkinje cells in the adult (PN60) cerebellar vermis, as well as in lobules I/II, VII and IX, was determined using the optical disector method combined with the Cavalieri technique. A significant deficit was found in the entire vermis (21%), as well as lobules I/II (48%), VII (25%) and IX (38%). 
 A third cohort of suckle control (SC) pups was used to investigate the lobular based vulnerability to apoptosis in normal cerebellar vermal Purkinje cells on PN4. The levels of Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA expression were investigated using laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate the Purkinje cell lobular based populations combined with quantitative RTPCR (qPCR) technique. This method enabled the determination of comparative levels of mRNA expression attributable to the Purkinje cell population in identified lobules. Results indicated that Bcl-2 is expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells and does not vary across the lobules. However, Bax expression could not be confirmed. 
 This thesis demonstrates the effects of a moderate ethanol binge on cerebellar vermal Purkinje cells on PN4. Findings demonstrate that apoptosis is initiated rapidly and results in the permanent loss of Purkinje cells, the degree of which is lobular dependent and greater than seen in the vermis as a whole. Thus significant cell loss can occur in discrete regions which may have specific discrete impairments in cerebellar function. Importantly for the human population, this study indicates that a single moderate alcohol binge is sufficient to cause significant permanent neuronal loss in the developing fetus, the onset of which occurs rapidly, and may result in specific brain dysfunctions.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">central nervous system</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">effect of chemicals</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">toxicology</field><field name="subject">cell death</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080905.144427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Host-specific Nod factor requirements for nodulation of Lotus species by Mesorhizobium loti</field><field name="creator">Rodpothong, Patsarin</field><field name="description">Mesorhizobium loti possesses a symbiosis island (ICEMlSym[R7A]) that confers upon the bacterium the ability to form a symbiotic association with legumes of the genus Lotus. Nodulation (nod, nol and noe) genes located on the ICEMlSym[R7A] encode enzymes that are responsible for the production of a species-specific signaling molecule, named Nod factor. Perception of Nod factors by plant receptors triggers several plant responses and facilitates bacterial invasion, leading to the formation of root nodules. The studies in this thesis aimed to examine the impact of various structural components of the M. loti Nod factor on host specificity and recognition within Lotus species. The minimal gene requirement for eliciting nodule development on Lotus plants was also determined. 
 The M. loti strain R7A Nod factor has a backbone of five N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. The non-reducing terminal GlcNAc residue carries an acyl chain of either a vaccenic acid (C[18:1]) or palmitic acid (C[16:0]), a carbamoyl group and a methyl group, while an acetylfucose is present at the reducing terminus. Analysis of loss-of-function [Delta]nodZ and [Delta]nolL mutants showed that the acetylfucose at the reducing terminus was required for efficient nodulation of Lotus species, especially during the initiation of infection threads and for induction of symbiotic gene, NIN. Upon inoculation with R7A[Delta]nodZ, nodulation of Lotus corniculatus and L. filicaulis was significantly delayed and reduced, while only a delay in the onset of nodulation was observed with L. japonicus. Interestingly, nodulation of L. burttii induced by R7A[Delta]nodZ was as efficient as that induced by R7A. Hence, the absolute requirement for the acetylfucose during nodulation was host-dependent. 
 In planta complementation and domain swap experiments using transgenic L. japonicus nfr1 and nfr5 mutants were employed to investigate the role of the reducing terminal acetylfucose in the perception of Nod factor. Nodulation of complemented L. japonicus nfr1 and nfr5 mutants inoculated with R7A[Delta]nodZ was poor, whereas similar plants inoculated with R7A nodulated well. This suggests that the in planta complementation was inefficient and as a result accentuated the effect of the acetylfucose on the Nod factor recognition. The responses of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between L. filicaulis and L. japonicus to inoculation with strain R7A[Delta]nodZ suggested that at least two genetic loci on chromosome 4, in addition to the Nfr1 and Nfr5 genes, contribute to Nod factor perception and in particular the host-specific recognition of the acetylfucose, This suggests the involvement of multiple receptors or a receptor with multiple components in the perception of Nod factors. 
 A gain-of-function study demonstrated that the presence of nodulation genes alone in nonsymbiotic mesorhizobia was sufficient to induce nodulation and bacteroid formation on Lotus plants, indicating that no other ICEMlSym[R7A] genes were required for infection thread formation or bacterial release. Nodulation assays of four Lotus species indicated host-specific requirements for nodulation genes. The presence of the nodA, nodC, nodD1, nodD2, nodZ, noeL and nolK genes was sufficient to permit nodulation of L. burttii, but was insufficient to induce nodulation of L. japonicus, L. corniculatus and L. filicaulis. The importance of the carbamoyl and methyl groups, and the influence of Nod factor concentration during nodulation were also implicated in this study. A model for the Nod factor perception in Lotus was proposed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhizobium</field><field name="subject">Rhizobium loti</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">plant molecular genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080910.113419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on new plant phytoplasma and viruses infections and molecular dissection of virus resistance using Medicago truncatula</field><field name="creator">M.Saqib@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The work presented in this thesis is in two areas - study of novel pathogens resulting from new encounters between crop and native species and &#145;mining&#146; for plant virus resistance genes in the model legume Medicago truncatula. 
The history of agriculture in Western Australia (WA) is less than 150 years old. All major broadacre and horticultural crops grown in WA have been introduced from overseas. These introduced horticultural and field crops potentially carry pathogens which may be transferred to infect native vegetation. Conversely, cultivated plants are vulnerable to infection by pathogens present in indigenous plants. This potential for new disease encounters is compounded by expansion of agriculture to crop new land and by predicted climate changes. These changes may provide selective advantage to a particular pest or disease, enabling infection to increase and so increase crop losses or damage native species. Global trade in agricultural produce also increases the potential for introduction of exotic pathogens. The focus of the first part of the research was to look for new pathogens of crops and native plants in WA. 
A series of field trips to study diseases in horticultural crops and native vegetation were made in the agricultural regions of Carnarvon, Broome, Kununurra, Perth and the surrounding metropolitan area. Although the initial focus was on virus diseases, the work expanded to study phytoplasma-associated diseases, because of their widespread occurrence and clear symptoms.
In the agricultural region around Kununurra the potyvirus Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) was found infecting Phaseolus vulgaris crops. Sequencing of isolates collected provided the first reliable molecular confirmation of the presence of BCMV in Australia. 
In joint work with K. Bayliss three commercial Paulownia tree plantations near Perth were found exhibiting symptoms of Witches'-Broom disease. The Paulownia trees were found to be associated with 'Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense' 16SrXII group. Chickpeas in the Kununurra region were found with symptoms of stunting, little leaf and proliferating branches and tested positive for phytoplasma. Sequencing confirmed the presence of a phytoplasma with high similarity to the 16SrII group 'Ca Phytoplasma aurantifolia' (peanut witches broom group). This is the first molecular evidence for a phytoplasma-associated disease in chickpea. Red clover (Trifolium pratense), several other pasture legumes and paddy melon (Cucumis myriocarpus) with symptoms of diminished leaf size, pallor, rugosity, leaf deformation, shoot proliferation and stunting were observed amongst pasture plots in south-western Australia. All species with these symptoms were positive for a phytoplasma resembling 'Ca Phytoplasma australiense, 16SrXII group. This association was confirmed for red clover and paddy melon by subsequent nested PCR and sequence analysis. This is the first time that 'Ca. Phytoplasma australiense, 16SrXII group, has been reported infecting these hosts in southern WA. Snakebean (Vigna unguiculata var. sesquipedalis) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) plants with phytoplasma-like symptoms were found in the horticultural region at Broome. The symptoms on snakebean were typical of phytoplasma disease. Sequence analysis identified that the agent associated with the symptoms as a strain of sweet potato little leaf strain V4 (SPLL-V4) phytoplasma (16SrXII group, strain of 'Ca Phytoplasma australiense'). SPLL phytoplasma has not been reported in snakebean or tomato in this isolated agricultural region. In a survey in the Gascoyne region phytoplasma-like symptoms were found in tomato, eggplant and papaya. Previously in this region plants had been found to be associated with peanut witches broom phytoplasma 16SrII group 'Ca Phytoplasma aurantifolia'. Phytoplasma-like symptoms which included bunchy growth, witches&#146; broom and &#145;little leaf&#146; were observed in Allocasuarina fraseriana (Western Sheoak, Casuarina) and Acacia saligna (Acacia, Orange Wattle) trees in Kings Park and Botanic Garden Perth WA. Phytoplasma-associated disease was confirmed for the first time in native Australian casuarina and acacia trees in WA. Based on the identification of these phytoplasma associated diseases in WA, phytoplasma-associated diseases can be divided into two zones, because phytoplasma 16SrII group was found mostly in the north west of WA and the 16SrXII group in the south west of WA. This work has added to knowledge of the extent and distribution of phytoplasma disease in WA: it is concluded that crop-associated phytoplasma disease originated from native vegetation.
The aim of the second part of the research was to screen and map a virus resistance gene in the model legume M. truncatula to better understand host/pathogen interactions of legume-infecting viruses. Natural resistance genes found in M. truncatula could then be used to locate similar genes in grain legumes (e.g. chickpea and lupins) for practical applications. M. truncatula is a model legume which has a relatively small genome. International consortia have been established to develop genomic resources for M. truncatula. The M. truncatula core collection (from SARDI, South Australia) totalling 230 accessions was screened for resistance/susceptibility to four legume-infecting viruses: Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) and Subterranean clover mottle virus (SCMoV). Five plants from each of the 230 phenotypically distinct members of the M. truncatula core collection were challenged with one isolate of each virus using infectious sap together with five uninoculated control plants for each accession. The symptoms that developed were recorded and virus presence was confirmed by ELISA for inoculated and systemic leaves. Accessions that were potentially resistant were retested to check for escapes. The result from this screen was that 5 accessions were potentially resistant to AMV, 56 to BYMV, 21 to CMV and 42 to SCMoV. The remaining accessions were susceptible to all four viruses with symptoms which ranged from no apparent symptoms (symptomless systemic infection) to highly susceptible and plant death. In continuing work with DAFWA (Dr R. Jones) accessions potentially resistant to AMV, BYMV and CMV are being challenged with additional isolates to check for the presence of genes providing broader resistance.
The Sobemovirus SCMoV was chosen for further study because it is the most widespread viral pathogen of subterranean clover pastures in Australia. It is also a high titre, mechanically transmitted virus which gave the least escapes on infection. SCMoV has a linear, single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 4.25 Kb. Making use of natural resistance is an effective means to reduce pasture losses caused by SCMoV. From the screen of the core collection of M. truncatula, amongst the lines resistant to SCMoV a single dominant hypersensitive resistance was detected in line DZA-315. To accelerate mapping of the SCMoV resistance gene, an F8 RIL population of a cross between the resistant line (DZA-315) and a susceptible line (Jemalong-J6, A-17) was sourced and obtained from INRA Toulouse. A total of 166 RILs were phenotyped for resistance and susceptibility to SCMoV. Resistant and susceptible lines showed parental phenotypic symptoms with 84 being susceptible and 82 being resistant. This indicated the presence of a single resistance (R) gene. This phenotypic data was combined with genotypic data (76 polymorphic molecular markers) already available for this RIL population to provide a framework map. Mapmaker and Mapmanager mapping programs were used to locate the position of the resistance gene. This framework map indicated a position for the resistance gene on the long arm of chromosome 6.
Additional polymorphic SSR markers flanking the R gene locus on chromosome 6 were used to map the position of the R gene more closely. These SSR markers were developed from a parental cross of M. truncatula line A17 and A20 at UC Davis and from a parental cross between line A17 and DZA 315 developed at INRA Toulouse. Ten new polymorphic SSR markers were identified and located on the long arm of chromosome 6 after analysis of the F8 RIL population. When combined with the other phenotypic and genotypic data a more accurate map position for the SCMoV R gene was obtained. The results indicate that the R gene to SCMoV is located on the long arm of M. truncatula chromosome 6 between position 35 to 38 centimorgans (cM). The closest marker to the SCMoV R gene is marker mtic153 which is about 2.3 cM away. From existing maps of M. truncatula most of the R genes located in this region are of the TIR-NBS-LRR type and occur in R gene clusters. A series of BACs that span the region of interest have been identified in which SCMoV R gene should be present.
M. truncatula has been used as a model legume to study a number of symbiotic (e.g. rhizobium) and pathogenic interactions (e.g. fungal and nematode), but this is the only example of its use to study legume-virus interactions. The results obtained indicate the potential of using M. truncatula as a model to study resistance response to other legume viruses and provide a firm basis for identifying the hypersensitive R gene that confers resistance to SCMoV</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080623.155153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The anatomy of two medical archetypes : a socio-historical study of Australian doctors and their rival medical systems</field><field name="creator">c.farag@optusnet.com.au</field><field name="description">In this thesis it is argued that the migration of ideas and personnel from Britain to colonial Australia resulted in the reproduction of two distinctive medical archetypes, namely, the soldier/saviour and the generalist (family) physician and surgeon.  These have been both conceptualised as&#148; ideal type&#148; carriers or expediters of two rival forms of medical professionalism. They each emerged in the &#145;modern&#146; era as institutional products of distinctive educational processes and work practices available for doctors in 19th and 20th century Britain and Australia. While Freidson (1988) asserts one of the problems of dealing with studies of professionalism is that researchers have failed to clearly define work patterns, he could be seen as being close to Foucault (1973) whose emphasis was on the different social spaces in which practitioners worked.  

I show firstly that the career of the &#145;imperial&#146; army medical officer was revived in the 19th century so that in colonial contexts they could alternate between military and civilian servicing, especially as administrators and managers in public office. The soldier/saviour was also associated with the 19th century revival of Masonic and quasi-Masonic military and religious orders, consecrated by royal sovereigns and exported to Australia.  In contrast, the Scottish pedagogues and other generalist doctors coming to Australia from Britain were influenced by Edinburgh University&#146;s Medical Faculty&#146;s humanist traditions and design of the &#147;modern&#148; medical curriculum producing the generalist physician and surgeon who met community needs. Within wider imperial social relations, these generalist doctors were looked upon as &#145;dissenting&#146; or counter-hegemonic.  

The aim of this thesis is to examine these archetypes in terms of their characteristics of rationalisation to analyse and understand their professional differences historically as well as in the contemporary period. The significance is that one does not often come across studies which specifically look at doctors within the same society in such terms. Furthermore, by locating them within wider hegemonic and counter-hegemonic social relations, links between ideas about medical professionalism and issues of human rights become evident. This follows the World Health Organization&#146;s directives to treat health or medical issues and human rights as a cross-cutting research activity. To my knowledge, no study has been undertaken in Australia of the background and impact of these different traditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical professionalism</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">sociology</field><field name="subject">human rights</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080625.134351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving off the Beaten Track: Developing a Critical Literacy in Backpacker Discourse</field><field name="creator">Rebeccajanebennett@gmail.com</field><field name="description">Reaching beneath the market surface of backpacker culture, this doctoral research probes uncomfortable politics, excluded voices and global inequalities. It questions why, in a context of economic inequality, environmental crisis, terrorism and war, the tourism industry continues to grow, unhampered by politically fractured and uneasy mediations of the world. Arguing that tourist modalities are defined in a popular memory matrix where the rules and norms for becoming a tourist are negotiated through conversation, television, popular literature, travel guides and the Internet, this research project critiques both popular and academic tourist pedagogy.

In forging an interdisciplinary dialogue between Cultural Studies and Tourism Studies, this doctoral research seeks new ways of theorising depost-globalisation. Market-driven renditions of the tourable world displace, marginalise and exclude oppositional, negative, violent and discriminatory narratives. Placing a spotlight on the discomforts found in backpacker discourse requires the application of progressive meta-theoretical discourses, alongside postcolonial and poststructuralist analysis. A serious study of touristic popular culture implicates tourism in terrorism, backpacking in poverty, imperialism in globalisation, mobility in power and backpacker discourse in the re-writing of a contemporary subaltern. 

The original contribution to knowledge emerging from this doctorate is via the application of Bauman and Said&#146;s late work to independent tourist discourses. The innovation is formed through disciplinary connections and popular cultural applications. There is also a re-theorisation of Spivak&#146;s most famous study, applying metaphors of the pyre to sites of backpacker tourism, with the aim of developing &#145;listening literacies.&#146; My research justifies the introduction of two new theoretical trajectories for the Tourism Studies academy. The first new approach encourages and frames a listening literacy amongst tourist cultures so they can acknowledge silenced and displaced agents in host &#150; guest interaction. The second new approach aims to infuse touristic popular culture with a powerful and political pedagogy that teaches mobile citizens to read difference and diversity.

A pleasure filter obscures the costs and consequences of global markets, often at the expense of local communities and individuals. This thesis focuses on the inequalities disseminated in and through backpacker tourism. It posits that it is not only important to change the way the tourist industry operates but also that it is necessary to change the way tourists tour. Moving off the beaten track in approaches to the study of tourism, this research project forges a new path for Tourism Studies that merges cultural theory and everyday life to develop a critical academic literacy for backpacker discourse.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">backpackers</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080625.140648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomineralisation processes in the radula teeth of the chiton Acanthopleura hirtosa (Mollusca: Polyplacophora)</field><field name="creator">jeremy.shaw@uwa.edu.au</field><field name="description">A detailed row by row investigation of major lateral tooth cusp mineralisation, together with the concomitant development of the superior epithelial tissue surrounding the teeth of the chiton Acanthopleura hirtosa has been undertaken using a combination of light microscopy, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. A holistic approach has been adopted that encompasses observations over a range of spatial scales, from whole radula mineralisation processes to those occurring within individual tooth cusps at various stages of development. In addition, mineralisation in radulae from freshly collected animals has been compared to that of animals maintained for extensive periods within a newly developed iron limited system, which restricts radula mineralisation without impeding the formation of the organic matrix.
An evaluation of the iron limitation technique has revealed that maintaining specimens of A. hirtosa within an iron poor environment results in a significant departure from the normal pattern of mineralisation in these animals. As a consequence of iron limitation, there is an obvious increase in the number of unmineralised tooth rows in addition to associated alterations in structure and composition at all stages of tooth development.
In normal specimens of A. hirtosa, the onset of mineralisation in the tooth cusps occurs following the prior accumulation of iron at the junction zone and the sudden accumulation of iron containing granules in the cusp epithelium at tooth row 13. The superior epithelium surrounding the tooth cusps undergoes a series of developmental changes leading up to, and following, the onset of mineralisation. In particular, the abundance of mitochondria within the apical cusp epithelium increases, presumably in order to provide the ideal conditions of pH, and thus solubility, needed for the supersaturation of iron and its nucleation at row 13. Once mineralisation has commenced, the microvilli attached to the cusps develop rapidly, and are suggested to do so in order to facilitate the transport of iron, and thereby ensure that a high concentration gradient of this element into the cusps is maintained.
The delivery of iron into the cusps occurs from two fronts, the first from the superior epithelium via the posterior surface, and the second from the junction zone via an internal pathway situated along the lepidocrocite boundary between the magnetite and core regions of the tooth. The existence of a plume of elements between this internal mineralisation pathway and the junction zone, provides the first direct evidence that the junction zone is involved in the storage and release of elements for cusp mineralisation. Data from iron limited radulae also indicate that iron continues to be deposited at the junction zone in preference to the superior epithelium or cusps, despite the disruption of mineralisation, highlighting the importance of this region in the mineralisation process.
Iron reinstatement experiments have also shown that the internal pathways of iron delivery within the organic matrix remain viable, despite prolonged periods of iron limitation. In addition, the reinstatement of iron has revealed that the plumes, situated between the junction zone and internal mineralising pathway of the cusp, stem from the centre of the plate like junction zone, directly above the stylus canal, a tube like cavity situated within the styli of each major lateral tooth.
An in depth study of the stylus canal has revealed that cells within the canal are remarkably similar to those of the epithelium surrounding the cusps, suggesting that this structure may also be involved in the delivery of ions to the junction zone. The stylus canal is shown to be present in the major lateral tooth cusps of 38 chiton species distributed worldwide, and is therefore likely to be a feature common to all chitons. The presence of the canal, and indeed its absence from the bases of all remaining non iron mineralised teeth, irrespective of chiton species, also points strongly to a functional relationship between the stylus canal and tooth cusp mineralisation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organic matrix</field><field name="subject">TEM</field><field name="subject">SEM</field><field name="subject">biomineralisation</field><field name="subject">cell ultrastructure</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080703.163505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Semiotic Investigation of the Digital: What Lies Beyond the Pixel</field><field name="creator">m.muller@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores the implications of new photographic and computer technologies that offer the transduction of modalities. The fundamental argument, here, is that such technologies &#145;change&#146; the process of sense-making resulting in a new asymmetry that informs the visual language of the creative work. 
I argue that the processes of language analysis can assist us in the interpretation of multimodal texts and that a digital illustration can be analysed via the theoretical framework &#145;built&#146; from the first linguistic concepts such as those to be found in the texts of Plato, Aristotle, Augustine and Locke. A semiotic method applied in the context of digital artwork, and developed from the linguistic-semiotic stand-point, is well suited for an examination of the intermodal relations (the relations between layers in a multi-layered image file). By examining the layered structures of my images I demonstrate the evident similarity between the disconnection of the components of the linguistic sign on the one hand and the visual sign on the other hand. The analysis of a digital image, especially created for this purpose, is expanded by an investigation that offers a partial reading from an insider&#146;s point of view that involves an image being analysed on the conceptual level. This involves the examination of the primary internal relations between the layers of the image, and on the level of expression, the examination of the primary external relations between the layers and the narrative of the image.
In its deployment the semiotic method I use investigates the existence and the conditions of a space in which the individual readings from the perspective of outsider and insider might be conceptualized and presents a partial reading derived from an outsider&#146;s interpretation of the same image. After comparing both readings I arrive at the conclusion that the different texts&#146; modalities have an impact on the degree of the sign components&#146; disconnection. My conclusion, then, is that an outsider who cannot view the image in its multimodal form assigns sign components in a higher degree of disconnection than an insider who has access to the intermodal relations of the image file.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">visual semiotics</field><field name="subject">digital art</field><field name="subject">multimodality</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080717.92700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participation of Indigenous students in education: an exploration of the significance of place in an Indigenous community school</field><field name="creator">P.Mudhan@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This study explores the pedagogical significance of life experiences of Indigenous students from an Australian community school and its relation to school participation. In particular the study focuses on the implications of students&#146; associations with &#145;place&#146; on school curriculum. With the rate of participation of Indigenous students in education currently lower compared with non-Indigenous students, this study further informs our understanding of this phenomenon. 

The study is interpretive, based on the perspectives of students, staff and parents of an Indigenous community school successful in improving participation of Indigenous students to Year 10, and informed by the researcher&#146;s own lived experiences teaching Indigenous students in three different countries. During this time, it was observed that Indigenous students&#146; association with place was a significant factor in their participation in education. 

Gruenewald&#146;s multidimensional framework for place-conscious education is employed to guide the analysis and interpretation of data as it provides a means of addressing two important issues revealed in the review of literature on participation. First, participation is examined and interpreted in different ways, and second, a common thread in the differing interpretations is the concept of place. Analyses of the data reveal two overarching dimensions: Place and Aboriginality. Further analysis, informed by notions of place-conscious education reveal five identifiable elements for enhancing participation of Indigenous students in education: Curriculum Method, Curriculum Content, Careers, Partners and Identity. Educational programs that recognise how these elements are related to place and action them are likely to be more effective in enhancing participation of Indigenous students in education.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Participation</field><field name="subject">Indigenous</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080730.151937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeny, phylogeography and movement of Kirramyces spp. associated with leaf blight diseases of plantation eucalypts</field><field name="creator">V.Andjic@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">When this study commenced in early 2004, only five Phaeophleospora species. had been reported from eucalypts of which only two; P. destructans (STE-U 1336) and P. epicoccoides (STE-U 1346) had been sequenced. In a former study, Phaeophleospora species emerged in two separate clades suggesting that Phaeophelospora is polyphyletic. The appearance and severity of lesions on eucalypt leaves are generally used to recognise the species of Phaeophleospora responsible for disease. However, depending on host and climate, the symptoms associated with infection by P. epicoccoides, P. eucalypti and P. destructans can be almost identical and incorrect diagnosis is a common problem. Thus, Phaeophleospora species were compared based on DNA sequences and multi gene genealogies were constructed. In addition species- specific primers were designed and tested on leaf material.

Many isolates of Phaeophleospora spp. were collected and sequenced, and all Phaeophleospora spp. from eucalypts were shown to cluster together and are closely related to the most important leaf pathogens associated with eucalypts namely Colletogloeopsis zuluensis, Mycosphaerella cryptica and M. nubilosa. In contrast, these fungi are distantly related to the type specimen of the genus Phaeophleospora, P. eugeniae. Furthermore, all DNA sequences of isolates of P. destructans examined in this thesis, including the ex-type culture, were identical but different to one previously lodged in GenBank.

This phylogenetic separation led to a morphological study of the species assigned to Phaeophleospora and compared the species from eucalypts with P. eugeniae the type specimen of Phaeophleospora. The phylogenetic and morphological studies show that P. eugeniae is well separated from Phaeophleospora spp. occurring on eucalypts and led to the resurrection of the previous generic name, Kirramyces for Phaeophleospora spp. occurring on eucalypts. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis and morphological observation of Kirramyces spp. and Colletogloeopsis spp. occurring on eucalypts showed considerable overlap between these two genera. Therefore, Colletogloeopsis was reduced to synonymy with Kirramyces. Consequently, the genus Kirramyces was expanded from five to 14 species, and included the description of two new species, K. angophorae and K. corymbiae. In order to assist with their identification a key based on morphology of conidia for Kirramyces species was developed.

Kirramyces destructans is a devastating pathogen originally described from Indonesia in 1996 and has since been found throughout Asia where all common tropical and subtropical plantation eucalypt species and hybrids are susceptible. K. destructans is considered a major biosecurity threat in Australia, both to native eucalypt forests and the tropical plantation industry. Prior to the current study, there had been no investigation into the origin and movement of this important pathogen. Thus, five gene regions and six microsatellite loci were sequenced for 43 representative isolates of K. destructans from a range of geographical locations and hosts. Two microsatellite markers detected very low nucleotide polymorphism (three haplotypes for each loci); five other gene regions, including four microsatellite region were uniform. This low level of genetic diversity provides strong evidence that K. destructans was introduced into Indonesia as a founder population and that it has subsequently been spread throughout Asia via human-mediated movement of germplasm. Timor and Northern Australia were considered to be a possible source of origin of this fungus, but the high susceptibility of native E. urophylla to K. destructans in Timor indicates that the pathogen is unlikely to be endemic to Timor.

The current distribution of Kirramyces eucalypti is New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and New Zealand (North Island). The main host of this pathogen is E. nitens which is native to Victoria and New South Wales. Kirramyces eucalypti has not been found in South Africa, yet it causes a severe disease on eucalypt hybrids originating from South Africa growing in New South Wales indicating movement to these hybrids from either native eucalypts or nearby plantations. As such, K. eucalypti poses a threat for the plantation industry in sub-tropical and tropical Australia. The phylogeography of K. eucalypti in Australia and New Zealand was studied by sequencing three gene regions and one microsatellite locus of fifty-seven representative isolates of K. eucalypti from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and New Zealand. The highest genetic variation was found among isolates from NSW suggesting that K. eucalypti originates from NSW. Isolates in New Zealand appear to have been introduced from NSW. Isolates from Queensland were consistently different to those from other regions and may in fact represent a cryptic species or a hybrid.

During monitoring of eucalypt taxa trials in far North Queensland, infected leaves resembling symptoms typical of K. destructans were collected and examined. Phylogenetic data based on three gene regions and some morphological characteristics revealed a new taxon described in this study as K. viscidus. Kirramyces viscidus was also shown to be closely related to the devastating pathogen K. destructans. Kirramyces viscidus had been found to cause extensive damage to eucalypt hybrids originating from South America, and less damage to E. grandis from Australia, indicating that this pathogen is probably endemic to Australia. Kirramyces viscidus has the potential to seriously damage tropical eucalypt plantations, especially if clonal and planted off-site.

In conclusion, this study resurrected genus Kirramyces for the Phaeophleospora and Coletoglloeopsis spp. occurring on eucalypts. It also studied the phylogeography and gene flow of the two most important Kirramyces species, K. destructans and K. eucalypti and describes three new Kirramcyes spp. found on eucalypts in Australia. Very recently, K. destructans has been discovered in Northern Australia. This raises a whole series of new issues as there are now several pathogens, K. eucalypti, K. viscidus and K. destructans present in Australia that known to cause serious damage on plantation eucalypts. Recent investigations have also revealed several undescribed Kirramyces spp. in Northern Australia. Their impact, distribution, movement and potential for hybridization now need to be examined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kirramyces</field><field name="subject">phylogenetics</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080805.133632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiences of schooling of students with former Yugoslav ethnic background in a Western Australian secondary school</field><field name="creator">lasko2nd@yahoo.com.au</field><field name="description">Ethnicity is an important social construct mobilised in the discourses of multicultural education. At present, little research exists on the way ethnicity impacts on the schooling experiences of students with former Yugoslav background (SFYB) in Australia.

This qualitative study looks at the daily realities of twelve SFYB at a Western Australian government secondary school. Particular attention is paid to the management of their ethnic identities to achieve their educational, social and other goals.

Data gathered from the twelve in-depth, guided interviews with SFYB is analysed through the lens of critical multiculturalism, posited as one of several notions of multiculturalism and one with a specific social justice agenda. Theories of hybridity developed by Homi Bhabha and Stuart Hall are translated into the critical multiculturalist framework and provide a further development of the analysis of the data in which hybridity is seen as both experiences and enactments.

In Taiwan, there was a severe outbreak of FMD after more than 60 years freedom from the disease. The virus strain, O Taiwan 97 from the March 1997 outbreak of FMD in Taiwan, however, has been shown to have a species-specific adaptation to pigs. Although there are 7 distinct serotypes of FMD found in different regions of the world, this study focuses on the pig-adapted type O strain of FMD.

After the FMD outbreak commenced in Taiwan, the spread of disease was very rapid and the whole of the western parts of Taiwan was affected within a few days after the diagnosis of FMD was confirmed. In some situations airborne transmission of FMD virus was suspected and it was speculated that this was the explanation for such rapid spread in Taiwan. Therefore, studies were conducted to investigate the transmissibility of O Taiwan/97 FMDV to susceptible pigs by direct and indirect spread including airborne spread in an enclosed animal house. This study showed that pigs in direct contact with challenged pigs became infected but none of the close-contact pigs became infected. These experiments clearly demonstrated that the pig adapted strain O Taiwan/97 was only efficiently transmitted by direct contact. This indicates that effective control against future outbreaks of pig adapted FMDV strains could be achieved by restriction of pig movement and stamping out if the outbreak has been detected in the early stages and prior to the movements of pigs from the infected premises.

The measures used to control the Taiwanese FMD outbreak in 1997 were initially the slaughter of whole herds in the infected premises. However, with the rapid spread and large numbers of cases, the decision was taken to use universal compulsory vaccination of pig herds to control the outbreak when sufficient supply of vaccines was organized. Type O FMD vaccines were imported from a number of major FMD vaccine manufactures from around the world. Initially, vaccine efficacy for the imported vaccines was tested by measurement of neutralizing antibody titers in vaccinated pigs. To establish the relationship between serum neutralizing titers and protection from foot and mouth disease in pigs after vaccination, challenge studies were conducted with O/Taiwan/97 FMD in vaccinated pigs. Additionally, antibody responses to structural (neutralizing antibody) and non-structural proteins (NSP) were evaluated in vaccinated pig herds after primary and secondary vaccination in herds infected before and after vaccination.

In order to be able to monitor the circulation of virus in vaccinated pig populations, valid diagnostic kits based on the detection of antibody against NSP were required. These tests needed to be evaluated against pig sera derived from challenge studies and natural FMD outbreaks. Three commercially available ELISAs (Cedi, UBI and Checkit), which were available to differentiate infected from vaccinated pigs, were tested and results showed that the Cedi test had the optimal sensitivity and specificity for pig adapted type O FMD testing. This test was used to retrospectively evaluate the sera collected from infected and non-infected pig herds collected sequentially in the year after the 1997 FMD outbreak in Taiwan. These studies also showed that the early vaccines used, stimulated NSP antibody production in swine herds that were vaccinated but not infected. This resulted in the requirement for purified FMD vaccines to be used when monitoring programs for FMD infection by NSP testing were in place. In these studies, it was also demonstrated that the purified FMD vaccines used later in the control program did not induce NSP antibody after multiple double dosage to pigs. 

Although clinical FMD appeared to be successfully controlled with vaccination program in Taiwan it was essential for the eradication plan to maintain active surveillance for NSP reactors in the pig population. The UBI and Cedi NSP kits were applied as screening and confirmatory tests, respectively, to pig sera collected in auction markets distributed around Taiwan to monitor for evidence of the circulation of FMD virus. Herds with positive reactors were followed-up by clinical inspection and 15 sera from suspected herds were further sampled. Negative results were obtained from all these investigation. With the absence of clinical outbreaks and the lack of evidence of FMDV circulation in the field from the NSP reactor surveillance, the Taiwanese government has progressed the eradication plan to a progressive cessation of vaccination, commencing with banning of vaccination on one isolated island in December 2006. The absence of outbreaks on that island, paved the way for further cessation of FMD vaccination in Taiwan from July 2008.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">foot and mouth disease</field><field name="subject">Neutralizing antibodies</field><field name="subject">Vaccines</field><field name="subject">Non-structural proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080813.104029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Independent scholarly reporting about conflict interventions: negotiating aboriginal native title in south Australia</field><field name="creator">j.morrison@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis uses an action research methodology to develop a framework for improving independent scholarly reporting about interventions addressing social or environmental conflict. As there are often contradictory interpretations about the causes and strategic responses to conflict, the problem confronting scholar-reporters is how to address perceptions of bias and reflexively specify the purpose of reporting. It is proposed that scholar-reporters require grounding in conventional realist-based social theory but equally ability to incorporate theoretical ideas generated in more idealist-based peace research and applied conflict resolution studies. To do this scholar-reporters can take a comparative approach systematically developed through an integrated framework as described in this thesis. 

Conceptual and theoretical considerations that support both conventional and more radical constructions are comparatively analysed and then tested in relation to a case study. In 2000 Aboriginal people throughout South Australia deliberated whether their native title claims could be better accorded recognition through conservative court processes or a negotiation process to allay deep-seated conflict. The author, in a scholar-reporter capacity, formulated a report attributing meaning to this consultative process. 

As such a report could have been formulated according to alternative paradigms, methodological approaches and theoretical frameworks, the analysis of the adopted framework highlights how different approaches can bias the interpretation of the process and prospects for change. Realist-based conservative interpretations emphasise 'official' decision-making processes where legitimacy is expressed through political and legal frameworks based on precedent. Idealist-based interpretations emphasise that circumstances entailing significant conflict warrant equal consideration being given to 'non-official' 'resolutionary' problem-solving processes where conflict is treated as a catalyst for learning and outcomes are articulated as understanding generated about conflict and how different strategies can transform it. 

The developed integrated framework approach establishes the independence of scholarly reporting. Its purpose goes beyond perpetuating scholarly debate about alternative 'objective' understandings of conflict; it focuses primarily on communicating a more inclusive understanding of the contradictions inherent in a particular conflict. It increases the capacity to understand when, where, why and how conflict precipitates social change, and articulates possibilities for reconceptualising what might be the more sustainable direction of change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">scholarly independent reporting</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural conflict resolution</field><field name="subject">peace/sustainability research</field><field name="subject">negotiating native title</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080904.141252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-Cultural Adjustment of Expatriate Managers: A Comparative Study of Australian Managers Working in Korea and Korean Managers Working in Australia</field><field name="creator">H.Chang@curtin.edu.au</field><field name="description">International assignments are increasingly important in the global business world but many assignments end up in failure causing heavy losses on many expatriates and their organizations. This study employees a multi-dimensional approach, as suggested by much of the literature on international assignments of Australian expatriates in Korea and Korean expatriates in Australia. 

Hierarchical regression indicated that their expatriate success in performance can be accurately predicted by &#145;Family Adaptation&#146; how well the family adapted to the overseas location, &#145;Nationality&#146; where Korean respondents reported a much higher level of family adaptation with the move compared to Australian managers, and &#145;Age&#146; that older managers were more likely to report success with an overseas posting. &#145;Family adaptation&#146; with overseas work assignments, was determined by the level of &#145;Spouse Agreement&#146; and &#145;Nationality.&#146;

Overall, Korean expatriates rated their own performance and level of adaptation much higher than those of Australians in all measurement categories. The Korean group may have outperformed the Australian expatriate group in adjustment and performance, possibly due to their strength in language skills, educational level, religious and socialization commitments, situation-orientation, but most importantly, due to the stability in family and spouse relationships. The outcome suggests that organizations should address the issues related to spouse adjustment in order to ensure successful expatriate operations, from the stage of accepting assignments to the repatriation stage. There is some evidence at least in this research to suggest that these findings need to be replicated with larger samples and considered in future management policy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Korean</field><field name="subject">Employment</field><field name="subject">Foreign countries</field><field name="subject">Foreign executives</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080908.105229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forming moral community: Christian and Ecclesial Existence in the Theology of Karl Barth, 1915-1922</field><field name="creator">Mikeois@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of Karl Barth&#146;s theology in the turbulent and dynamic years of his nascent career: 1915 &#150; 1922, with a special focus on the manner in which he construed Christian and ecclesial existence. The thesis argues that Karl Barth developed his theology with an explicit ecclesial and ethical motive, that is, he developed his theology as a deliberate attempt to shape the ethical life of the church in the context within which he lived and worked. It contends that criticisms suggesting that Barth does not have an ethics are inaccurate assessments of his work, and in fact, that although it is evident that his ethical thought continued to develop throughout his career, major trajectories of Barth&#146;s development are present in germinal form even at this early stage.

Following the lead and suggestion of John Webster, the thesis adopts a chronological and exegetical reading of Barth&#146;s work from his initial dispute with his liberal heritage circa 1915 until the publication of the second edition of his commentary on Romans. Materials examined from this period include sermons, lectures, book reviews, personal correspondence and biblical commentaries, with particular care being taken to identify the occasion and historical context within which Barth presented his thought. This reading seeks to uncover and present the development, structure, content and logic of Barth&#146;s own thought, in hope that the central concerns of this thesis will be validated. Examination of these materials has indeed shown that Barth developed his theology with an ecclesio-ethical motive.

The significance of this thesis is twofold. First, it contributes to broader understanding of Barth&#146;s theology both in its early development, and with regard to his ecclesiology and ethics. Second, it provides a significant framework and material for contemporary ecclesial reflection on its own identity and mission.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Karl Barth</field><field name="subject">ecclesiology</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080908.105728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bad habits temptation &amp; the divided self a work of fiction and a critical accompaniment using the lunatic asylum, the theatre and the uncanny motif of the double, in the context of nineteenth-century Fremantle, to explore female sexuality and fractured</field><field name="creator">jbmorrison@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">&#147;Bad Habits: Temptation &amp; The Divided Self&#148; is a thesis comprising an original work of fiction and a critical accompaniment, which use the lunatic asylum, the theatre and the uncanny motif of the double, in the context of nineteenth-century Fremantle, to interrogate social conformity and the patriarchal repression of female sexuality.

Victorian society polarised women into either selfless, virtuous angels of the house or fallen women beyond redemption. While the former exemplified an unforgiving, patriarchal notion of femininity, the latter bore the stigma of &#145;moral insanity&#146; and, given the right circumstances, could lead to a period of incarceration in the lunatic asylum. Thus, in fledgling Fremantle, psychiatry and the gothic lunatic asylum were deeply implicated in enforcing a patriarchal ideology on women. 

The Victorian rhetoric of virtue considered women more susceptible than men to the contaminating forces of such cultural phenomena as novels and the theatre. As such, actresses were both cause and effect of social contamination: not quite fallen, but similarly tainted. The protagonist in my historical fiction is an actress who experiences an uncomfortable dual consciousness when on stage as her &#145;awareness&#146; watches from the wings, surveyor of herself surveyed. This duality is further entrenched when she is photographed by a local portrait artist and is admitted to Fremantle&#146;s lunatic asylum for wilful and &#145;promiscuous&#146; behaviour, diagnosed as suffering symptoms of &#145;moral insanity&#146;. 

Deprived of her freedom, she learns to view her past as something shameful and unnatural and is thus triumphant when she makes permanent the cleavage between her new conscience and her old. It is only on her release that she discovers the consequences of that division: an uncanny but inescapable relationship with her living, breathing double.

Today, women are bombarded with images of the ideal feminine and girls are sexualised at an increasingly young age, and so a discussion of femininity, as defined by patriarchy, and the way it shapes a woman&#146;s identity are as relevant as it has ever been. 

&#147;Bad Habits&#148; is designed to evoke a gothic Fremantle in which to explore motifs that arise in the numerous texts on the gothic and the uncanny manifestation of the divided self. These literary texts, read alongside those which analyse the fixation of Victorian society on the bodies, minds and weaknesses of women, have provided the framework for a critical analysis of the finished work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080908.110959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Postmodern Sacred Popular Culture Spirituality in the Genres of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Fantastic Horror</field><field name="creator">estrangedcognition@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">In my thesis I argue that the return of the religious in contemporary culture has been in two forms the rise of so-called fundamentalisms in the established faiths-Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, even Buddhist-and the rise of a New Age style spirituality that draws from aspects of those faiths even as it produces something distinctively different. I argue that this shift both produces post-modern media culture, and is itself always-already mediated through the realm of the fictional. Secular and profane are always entangled within one another, a constant and pervasive media presence that modulates the way that contemporary subjects experience themselves and their relationship to the spiritual. I use popular culture as an entry point, an entry point that can presume neither belief nor unbelief in its audiences, showing that it is &#147;unreal&#148; texts such as Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, The Matrix and so on that we find religious symbols and ideas refracted through a postmodernist sensibility, with little regard for the demands of &#147;real world&#148; epistemology. 

I argue that it is in this interplay between traditional religions and New Age-ised spirituality in popular culture that the sacred truly finds itself in postmodernity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postmodern</field><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">science fiction</field><field name="subject">fantasy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080908.140222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of an Outcomes Focused Approach to Education: A Case Study</field><field name="creator">classicflora@aapt.net.au</field><field name="description">Outcomes focused education is an educational reform movement that has influenced many countries, including Australia, in recent years. In this study the case of one primary school in Western Australia is examined.  The study explores how this single school has implemented an outcomes approach within the context of large-scale jurisdictional change. 
The research design utilises the qualitative approaches of ethnography and phenomenology to develop a layered case study with the basic unit of analysis being the school site. A number of richly informative case studies, from within this single site, have been developed drawing on data from a broad range of stakeholders including teachers, students, parents and the school&#146;s principal. Departmental and school based documents have also been utilised to inform and guide the development of each case study. Emergent themes with respect to the implementation of educational change have been identified and the implications of these are discussed. 
At the time of the study the school site was only in its fifth year of operation, and a variety of key factors were identified as having a significant impact on the level of success achieved in implementation. The change management model as used by the school is identified and described, and several critical areas of weakness are revealed. As a result, the study raises critical questions about the effectiveness of the model used by the school and therefore questions the potential for this model to be used successfully in other schools implementing similar pedagogical change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">outcomes based education</field><field name="subject">implementation</field><field name="subject">change management</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080911.114438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tide Weavers Project</field><field name="creator">julieraff@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">The Tide Weavers Project examines the representation of landscape
in motion picture films and explores the ways in which certain filmmakers
closely reference the desert landscape to mirror and represent notions of self
and consequently, to shape film character portrayal. I argue that these
filmmakers use this setting to describe a particular relationship for
themselves and their characters. In this relationship the desert becomes a
space in which to project and examine aspects of self and it can initiate a
transaction or relationship so intimate that at many points, (human) being
becomes landscape, and landscape becomes being.
I will draw on the work of a range of Philosophers and Postcolonial
theorists to inform my reading of this relationship and to frame my
engagement with specific Australian and international films. The inclusion
and analysis of my own desert-based motion picture script Tide Weavers will add to my understanding of the possibilities of film (as a medium) provides
for altering an audiences' reading of landscape. I challenge the notion of
estrangement from the land, either though ignorance or where colonialist
landscape theory detracts from a sense of connectedness, such as through
the superficial or subjective application of cartography, fear arising from
monotonous and unfamiliar geography, and the eroticising of land as
woman. I engage with current theory surrounding the idea of fusion with
landscape to open new opportunities for exploring landscape/character
interaction. I also propose that collaborative working processes between
indigenous and non-indigenous filmmakers have the potential to alter the
ways in which landscape is both represented and interpreted.
I then look at how these ideas are translatable to the themes of the
Tide Weavers script. Grief and gender are primary themes, with an
emphasis on how respite, sacred space and surrender to landscape can
lead to healing. I believe this work will contribute to exciting new filmic
interpretations of landscape theory.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080915.134542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community participation in government and private sector planning: a case study of health and telecommunications planning for rural and remote Western Australia</field><field name="creator">martinia@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">This study was conducted in the context of health service planning in an environment of changing government strategies for regional, rural and remote area health care and telecommunications infrastructure planning in Western Australia. The study provides an account of the State Government of Western Australia&#146;s planning for the implementation of a telecommunications network infrastructure, and specifically the Telehealth Project, conducted between 1998 and 2002.

The purpose of this study was to examine influences on community participation in planning within the dynamic political, economic and social forces that impact on the development of regional, rural and remote area health services. Specifically, the study outlines the issues and barriers in providing for significant local participation in projects that are centrally initiated and controlled. It examines the influences in planning for projects that incorporate local community based beliefs and needs, the requirements of collaborating with multiple state and national government departments, and the private sector.

This study was situated within the interpretive paradigm, and is conceptualised within Donabedian&#146;s (1969) framework for assessing and assuring quality in health care. The methodological approach is bound within a case study and consists of a participatory action research approach. The research method uses the single case to undertake in-depth interviews, observations and a survey to collect data from community, government and industry members as a basis for reflection and action.

The findings of the study clearly indicated that there was consensus between all rural, remote and metropolitan area participants that telecommunications did offer the opportunity to provide increased, improved or alternative health services. However, there were a number of obstacles to the success of the planning process, including a lack of local community inclusion in planning committees, poor communication within central government agencies, overuse of external consultants, a bias toward the medical view, a limited scope of invitation to contribute, and local information being overlooked in the final implementation plan.

Analysis of planning for the Telehealth Project reveals the implications of organisational and political stakeholders making final decisions about outcomes; and provides a reminder of the importance of engaging communities authentically when planning for health and telecommunications services which involve the public and
private sectors.

The originality and significance of this study stems from understanding how technology can advance community health; through measures such as the use of community participation strategies, through authentic community based leadership, truly representative participants, decentralised decision making, a focus on community based health needs and change management strategies that include all of these. Consequently, the study advances knowledge of community participation in planning, and the evidence suggests implications for practice, education and further research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rural and remote health</field><field name="subject">telecommunications</field><field name="subject">private sector planning</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081002.100047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A genealogical study of &#145;the child&#146; as the subject of pre-compulsory education in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Zsuzsanna.Millei@newcastle.edu.au</field><field name="description">The study produces a genealogy of &#145;the child&#146; as the shifting subject constituted by the confluence of discourses that are utilized by, and surround, Western Australian precompulsory education. The analysis is approached as a genealogy of governmentality building on the work of Foucault and Rose, which enables the consideration of the research question that guides this study: How has &#145;the child&#146; come to be constituted as a subject of regimes of practices of pre-compulsory education in Western Australia?

This study does not explore how the historical discourses changed in relation to &#145;the child&#146; as a universal subject of early education, but it examines the multiple ways &#145;the child&#146; was constituted by these discourses as the subject at which government is to be aimed, and whose characteristics government must harness and instrumentalize. Besides addressing the research question, the study also develops a set of intertwining arguments. In these the author contends that &#145;the child&#146; is invented through historically contingent ideas about the individual and that the way in which &#145;the child&#146; is constituted in pre-compulsory education shifts in concert with the changing problematizations about the government of the population and individuals. Further, the study demonstrates the necessity to understand the provision of pre-compulsory education as a political practice. 

Looking at pre-compulsory education as a political practice de-stabilizes the takenfor-granted constitutions of &#145;the child&#146; embedded in present theories, practices and research with children in the field of early childhood education. It also enables the de- and reconstruction of the notions of children&#146;s &#145;participation&#146;, &#145;empowerment&#146; and &#145;citizenship&#146;. The continuous de- and reconstruction of these notions and the destabilization of the constitutions of &#145;the child&#146; creates a framework in which improvement is possible, rather than &#147;a utopian, wholesale and, thus revolutionary, transformation&#148; in early education (Branson &amp; Miller, 1991, p. 187). This study also contributes to the critiques of classroom discipline approaches by reconceptualizing them as technologies of government in order to reveal the power relations they silently wield.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Preschool education -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Power (Social sciences)</field><field name="subject">Early Childhood</field><field name="subject">Political Aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081002.80627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terrestrial movements of the freshwater tortoise Chelodina longicollis</field><field name="creator">Stott, Philip.</field><field name="description">Includes reprint of journal article.

Individual Use in Copyright Law:
A Comparative Study of Australia and Thailand</field><field name="creator">Lamlert, Wariya</field><field name="description">The exceptions for individual use give rise to interesting and fundamental concerns drawing both international and national attention. There is uncertainty in the application of the individual use exceptions both in the international copyright treaties, particularly the three-step test of the Berne Convention, and in the national copyright legislation.
To have a better understanding of this concerns, this thesis aims to: investigate whether the exceptions for individual use can still maintain the balance of interests between the copyright holders and users; analyse the contribution that international copyright agreements and national copyright legislation may have made to assist in solving the conflict of interest between right holder countries and user countries in applying the exceptions for individual use; and conduct a comparative study of the application of the individual use exceptions in developed and developing countries.
The understandings that are found within this study are informed by relevant literature and by analysis of the application of the individual use exceptions. The thesis examines the application of the individual use exceptions in the international copyright treaties, namely, the Berne Convention, the TRIPS Agreement, and the WIPO Copyright Treaty in order to determine the appropriate ?balance? between the rights of owners and users in the three-step test. To explore the uncertainty in the individual use exceptions at the national level, a comparative case study is made between the exceptions for individual use in Australia, a developed country, and Thailand, a developing country.
The results of the study reveal three major answers. First, the exceptions for individual use are able to still maintain the balance of interest between right holders and users in the digital environment, if some amendments are made to keep pace with the digital environment. Secondly, to assist in the solution to the conflict of interest between right holder countries and user countries in applying the exceptions for individual use, the international copyright agreements can make a contribution by making some minor changes, mainly in the three-step test of the Berne Convention, and by continuing to provide special treatments for developing countries. Nationally, the contribution may be made by thoroughly protecting the right holders whilst also still allowing individual use by amending the copyright legislation to update to the digital age when necessary, enacting the relevant Acts, and establishing a collecting society.
Finally, from the comparison of the application of the exceptions for individual use as well as problems found and solutions proposed in developed and developing countries, in which Australia and Thailand are used as case studies, the comparison of the application of the exceptions for individual use can be divided into four categories: fair use exceptions (Australian fair dealing and Thai private use exceptions), free use exceptions, licences (Australian statutory licences and Thai compulsory licence), and limitation of legislative individual use provisions. In addition, the problem of different interpretations of the exceptions for individual use, the problem of conformity in the application of the exceptions for individual use according to the real purpose of the three-step test, which exists in Thailand, and the problem of response to the digital environment are all used as the frame for the comparison of the problems found and proposed solutions.
The findings of the study are significant as they can provide contributions to the copyright areas primarily in the legal aspect: amendment of the exceptions for individual use. In addition, they also contribute to the related aspect in the copyright areas: the economic aspect: the balance between developed and developing Countries; and the moral aspect: developing countries? development. In addition, the thesis proposes four useful recommendations to enable the balance of interest between the right holders and the users to be maintained: amendment of the wording in the three-step test of the Berne Convention, amendment of domestic copyright law and its exceptions for individual use, encouragement of the role of collective management organisations, and raising public awareness on the issue of copyright and its exceptions for individual use.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fair dealing</field><field name="subject">private use exceptions</field><field name="subject">Berne Convention</field><field name="subject">individual use</field><field name="subject">copyright law</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20080912.140432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and Performance characteristics of Elite
Mountain Bike Cyclists</field><field name="creator">Linaker, Kelly</field><field name="description">Cross-country (XC) mountain bike (MTB) riding is a new cycling discipline and research
examining the physiological demands of MTB racing is limited. The purpose of this study
was to comprehensively measure physiological characteristics, to identify the performance
demands of XC and time trial (TT) MTB racing and to simulate a field MTB race in the
laboratory to measure the physiological responses associated with racing.
Twelve male and four female elite MTB cyclists volunteered to take part in this study.
Subjects completed maximal aerobic power and, anaerobic power and capacity tests. MTB
race data was collected during TT and XC competitions with SRM MTB power cranks fitted
to the subjects MTB. Five male MTB cyclists (V
.
O2max 72.0 +/- 4.6 ml/kg/min-1, maximum
power output (MPO) 5.40 +/- 0.30 W/kg-1, maximum heart rate (HRmax) 189 +/- 7 bpm)
performed two laps of a MTB course in the field using their race bikes with MTB SRM power
cranks fitted. A laboratory MTB race simulation was performed using a wind braked
ergometer. Cyclists attempted to match the average and peak power output (W/kg-1) achieved
in the field trial in the laboratory. Power output (PO), heart rate (HR) and cadence
(revolutions per minute, rpm) were measured during field and laboratory trials, while oxygen
uptake (V
.
O2) was determined only during the laboratory simulation.
Results showed TT MTB racing is significantly shorter in duration and distance than XC
racing and significantly higher for power output and heart rate, with more time spent above
anaerobic threshold (16.0 +/- 2.4 and 22.8 +/- 4.3% time) and MPO (38.4 +/- 5.2 and 26.5 +/- 9.4%
time) than XC racing (p&lt;0.05). Mean power output and heart rate between the field and
laboratory trials were similar (4.18 +/- 0.55 and 4.17 +/- 0.15 W/kg-1 respectively, 175 +/- 9 and
170 +/- 8 bpm). Time spent below 2 W/kg-1 and above 6 W/kg-1 for the field and laboratory
trials accounted for ~32% and ~30% of the total time, respectively. During field and
laboratory trials, cyclists utilised 77.8 and 77.3% of MPO, 93 and 90% of HRmax, respectively.
There was a significant difference between mean cadence in the field and laboratory trials
(60.3 +/- 9.1 and 75.2 +/- 7.0 rpm, respectively, p&lt;0.05). The cadence band of 60-69 rpm
showed a significant difference between the time spent in that band from the field (14.6%) to
the laboratory (4.6%). The time spent above a cadence of 80 rpm in the field was 29.8%
compared to the laboratory at 62.0% of the time. Mean and peak V
.
O2 for the simulation was
57.5 +/- 3.3 and 69.3 +/- 4.4 ml/kg-1/min-1 respectively, with cyclists sustaining an average of
~80% V
.
O2max.
In summary, MTB competition requires multiple short-high intensity efforts and places high
demands on both the aerobic and anaerobic energy systems. The power output and heart rate
responses to a MTB field race are similar when simulated in the laboratory, although in the
laboratory higher cadences are selected for the higher power outputs than the field.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cross country</field><field name="subject">mountain bike</field><field name="subject">cycling</field><field name="subject">road</field><field name="subject">track</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20080916.141457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDY INTO THE IMPACTS
OF FLOW REGULATION ON AN UPLAND GRAVEL BED
RIVERINE ENVIRONMENT:
A TRIBUTARY CONFLUENCE IN THE SNOWY RIVER
DOWNSTREAM OF JINDABYNE DAM, AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Rose, Teresa</field><field name="description">Inter-Basin-Water Transfers significantly reduce flow and sediment regimes to the
downstream ecosystem effecting differential channel adjustment at various locations. It
is not known how macroinvertebrates adjust to flow regulation, either spatially or
temporally, because research is lacking into how morphological adjustment affects
benthic habitat. Feedback mechanisms that initiate the adjustment process must first be
identified, then the effect on benthic habitat becomes apparent, thus, providing a link to
macroinvertebrate response.
Since regulation there has been a 95% reduction in flow volume, a complete downward
shift in both the flow duration and flood frequency curves and a 194% increase in flow
constancy compared to the pre- dam period. Furthermore, Jindabyne Dam traps 99.9%
of the total incoming sediment load.
Upstream of the tributary the dominant river response was accommodation adjustment
with subsequent contraction of the river channel. Associated feedback mechanisms
were ?armouring? and vegetation encroachment. Downstream of the tributary response
was more complex, with channel contraction through aggradation and specifically the
formation of a tributary mouth bar and fan, mid channel lobate bar, transverse bar and
in-channel bench. Associated feedback mechanisms were interactions between
vegetation and sediment; channel morphology, flow and sediment distribution; and
sediment distribution, flow and channel morphology. These processes have had site
specific and reach scale impacts on benthic habitat.
Macroinvertebrate response to flow regulation was habitat specific (riffle or edge) and
seemed to correspond to either site, or reach scale morphological adjustment, whereas,
flow constancy seemed to affect edge macroinvertebrates throughout both reaches.
Spatially, macroinvertebrates have not adjusted to the post- dam flow regime and
temporally, macroinvertebrates have not recovered 30 years after the closure of
Jindabyne Dam. How physical processes change habitats and how these impact on a
river?s ecology and at what scale, are important considerations in river management.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rivers</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Snowy River</field><field name="subject">stream ecology</field><field name="subject">environmental aspect</field><field name="subject">water diversion</field><field name="subject">riparian ecology.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20080917.153237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">House museums as sites of memory</field><field name="creator">Webber, Susan</field><field name="description">Houses and the objects within them stand as tangible symbols of human memory. Some
memories are created unconsciously in day-to-day living; others are consciously attached
to objects that are cherished as symbols of other places, relatives and friends. Memories
may seem to be lost until they are rediscovered in moment of involuntary recall, triggered
by an object, a smell or taste.
The purpose of this research project is to investigate the memory experiences of
visitors to a house museum; what they do with those experiences and how important they
are to them.
Forty adult visitors to Calthorpes' House in the ACT were interviewed using the
focused interview technique with a framework of questions that allowed for a
conversational style and additional questions. The interviews were recorded and later
transcribed.
The results showed that all visitors reported experiencing memories during their
visit to Calthorpes' House. Many people found those experiences enjoyable and wanted
to share them with others.
These findings are important because they can inform the set-up, interpretation
and publicity of house museums in ways which will attract new visitors and help to
engage with visitors' interests when they visit house museums.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">museum</field><field name="subject">Calthorpes House</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">visitor experience</field><field name="subject">heritage interpretation.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20080925.100449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPING A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE ON LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE IN A PUBLIC SECTOR ORGANISATION - AN EXPLORATION OF WORKPLACE EXPERIENCE</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Monica</field><field name="description">Organisational learning and knowledge management theories are illustrated in this study as converging around discussion of three major themes: the role of the individual in the knowledge of the organisation; the increasing problematisation of the nature of knowledge; and debate over the role of mental models and organisational schema in the learning of the individual and organisation. In this study it is argued that these themes are aligned with central themes in complexity theories, and complexity is posited as an appropriate lens through which organisational experience might be viewed.
The confluent themes and complexity underpin a methodological approach that is inspired by grounded theory, but which recognises the value that complexity provides as a sensitising device to the research. Narrative methods are used to collect data and participants' sense-making informs the researcher's analysis of the results.
The emergence of a complex adaptive systems heuristic from the analysis of the collective narratives provides a ground for exploration of organisational members' experience using the grammar of complexity. This exploration leads to discussion of the ways in which complexity accommodates the consideration of learning and knowledge within a single frame.
While the experience of organisational members in many ways reflects the properties and mechanisms of complex adaptive systems, in this study the theory does not adequately describe the nature of their learning and knowledge development in the organisation. In this exploration, tension between the formal organisation and the emergent organisation leads to a disconnect between the local learning of members in interaction and the knowledge of the organisation. The nesting feature of complex adaptive systems, where levels of aggregation build hierarchy, is not apparent in this study and this finding is discussed as having important implications for learning and knowledge sharing in the organisation. In addition, the participants of this study do not describe their learning as simply mechanical, involving the building and rebuilding of mental models, as complex adaptive systems would suggest. Learning is described as far more elaborate than the theory immediately implies.
The findings of the study provide insight into the relationship between learning and knowledge in organisations through the lens of complexity as well as providing some input into developing theories of complexity. These insights are discussed with reference to the literatures across organisational learning, knowledge management and workplace learning fields and a number of implications for practice are suggested as a result.
The study supports the integration of organisational learning and knowledge within a single theoretical frame and points to more integrated organisational practice. That learning and knowledge management in organisations should remain discrete in practice is at odds with the theory and with the findings of this study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational learning</field><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">workplace training</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081001.124850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evidence-based practice in nursing homes</field><field name="creator">Chang, hui chen</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evidence-based practice</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Colours of Diversity: Women Educators
Turning the Gaze onto Australian Universities</field><field name="creator">Gopalkrishnan, Caroline</field><field name="description">The internationalisation of universities has attracted significant political and even
media attention, as well as internal focus. Concurrently, global discourses evolving
around the notion of borders, terrorism, security and identity have taken on a renewed
significance. Today, the articulation of identities has significant and even dire
consequences for many people living in different parts of the world. In Australia, too,
the matter of what it means to be ethnic, indigenous, non-indigenous or mixed-race is
highly contested, controversial and for some groups of people, in particular contexts,
even dangerous. In Australian higher education, the term international is commonly
used to refer to the other - citizens of other countries (including those who visit our
educational institutions). They are seen as the global citizens and we are not. Cultural
diversity is widely celebrated and legislated through the Commonwealth
Government?s Living in Harmony policy. Yet there is a dearth of knowledge and/or
discussion around members of staff who are different in our own universities. This
raises questions about how we come to differentiate between us and them in an
Australian socio-historical context, understanding how race and ethnic difference is
made salient in identification, and the knowledge production process.
This is a small-scale, in-depth qualitative study, which addresses a significant gap in
the literature on higher education by focusing on the experiences of four women
educators of colour, each of whom has brought with her a complex collage of
diasporic experiences, histories, identities and ways of knowing. By employing a
multi-race/ethnic dialogic methodology and a research conversation method, the study
presents the women?s experiences in narrative form, integrating the autoethnographic
writing of the researcher with the women?s stories about difference. The inquiry
provides new insights into what race and ethnic identity mean to the women in an
everyday, professional and ethical practice context.
The women?s stories are not of the traditional career or romantic multicultural kind,
but reach into the realms of the personal, political, philosophical and spiritual
dimensions of human experience. As they traverse the political terrain of the
Academy, the women have looked within and outside the university, navigating
multiple identities to make sense of their work. By documenting four women?s
experiences that have never been documented before, this small-scale study provides
basic research for others to build on.
This research affirms the salience of race and ethnicity in the university and the new
higher education knowledge creation ethos. The study reveals there is little current
evidence that Australian universities are capitalising on and applying opportunities
provided by research on race, ethnicity and difference to higher education debate and
reform. The women?s stories reveal that the issue of under-representation of women
of colour is not unique to the university, but is reflective of the powerful and
constitutive impact of discourses of race and difference in Australian society. By
highlighting the issues of who has the power and authority in the university to
determine what counts as a valid identity and how identity and knowledge boundaries
are policed within the Australian university, this research raises questions about the
wider implications of epistemological racism embedded in university practices in
relation to governance, curriculum, policy, teaching and learning. Through its
development and exploration of a multiple race and ethnic dialogic methodology, and
the use of research conversations as a method, the study sheds new light on the
complexities of Australian race politics in knowledge production and on women?s
differentiated experiences in higher education.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">race</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">equity</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081009.095141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synchronising subjective knowledge and knowledge management systems in organisations</field><field name="creator">Lakkaraju, Sai Kiran</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to develop a model for knowledge synchronisation in organisations. The research aim is further broken down into two research objectives that are handled during this study: &#8226; Examine and measure the gap between a typical organisation and a Learning Organisation and the corresponding organisation&#8217;s Subjective Knowledge and Knowledge Management Systems, and &#8226; Examine and create appropriate models and methods to synchronise organisation&#8217;s Subjective Knowledge and Knowledge Management Systems. This research attempts knowledge synchronisation in view of creation and maintenance of Learning Organisations. This study combines three broad areas in an organisation: Learning Organisations, Intellectual Capital, and Knowledge Management Systems. This research proposes a new organisational epistemology in the context of the Subjective and Objective Knowledge. The organisational ontology consists of five hierarchical layers: observation, data, information, knowledge and wisdom. Wisdom and observations, being embodied, are subjective in nature and they are referred to as Subjective Knowledge throughout the thesis. Data, information and knowledge of an organisation, being objective in nature, are contained in Information Systems or Knowledge Management Systems; and throughout the thesis they are referred to as Objective Knowledge. The significance of this research and its major contribution resides in the development and validation of a comprehensive model for Subjective - Objective Knowledge synchronisation, with a view of creation and maintenance of Learning Organisations. A Knowledge Synchronisation Model (KSM) has been proposed to measure the gap between a typical organisation and a Learning Organisation. Furthermore,    KSM also deals with the gap between an organisation&#8217;s Subjective Knowledge and Knowledge Management Systems. A web-based survey has been conducted to validate the proposed Knowledge Synchronisation Model. The unit of analysis has been &#8216;an organisation&#8217; with Knowledge Management initiatives. Snowball sampling technique has been used to contact such organisations and five hundred and ten responses have been received. Four hundred and seventy responses have been considered for analysis. Responses have been classified into four clusters: Learning Organisations, whose Subjective Knowledge and Knowledge Management Systems have been in sync, Technology oriented organisations with high Knowledge Management Systems and relatively low Subjective Knowledge, People oriented organisations with high Subjective Knowledge and relatively low Knowledge Management Systems, and finally, the organisations with no Knowledge Management strategy. Regression analysis has been used to validate the hypotheses. The orientation towards technology or people will present itself as missing organisational characteristics.    Two organisations from the survey participants have been selected for knowledge synchronisation through Action Research Studies. The first organisation has been identified as technology oriented and lacking organisational &#8216;Awareness&#8217; and &#8216;Systems Thinking&#8217;. A Community of Practice (CoP) and a knowledge portal have been suggested to the first organisation for knowledge synchronisation. The second organisation has been identified as people oriented and lacking &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;Personal Mastery&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;. A Community of Practice (CoP) and a knowledge base have been suggested to the second organisation. The limitation posed by the sampling technique &#8216;snowball sampling&#8217; is a significant limitation in this research. This research does not consider the effects of location and investor capital on the proposed model. This is another limitation of this research. This research has academic implications for the theories of Learning Organisations, Intellectual Capital and Knowledge Management. Further investigations will be necessary to study the effects of location and investor capital, human related issues such as trust and culture, and the latest technologies such as web 2.0 and mobile devices, on the proposed model.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">organizational learning</field><field name="subject">organizational effectiveness</field><field name="subject">management information systems</field><field name="subject">information resources management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the geological resources of the Southern Highlands of NSW as raw materials for studio ceramics</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Steve</field><field name="description">An investigation of the geological resources of the Southern Highlands was undertaken and over two hundred samples were collected and examined for possible use as stoneware ceramic ingredients. Thirty four of these samples were tested for possible use as clay body ingredients, while sixty five samples were selected for assessment as glaze ingredients. A wood fired kiln was built from firebricks produced from a local deposit of a white bauxite related material. Materials selected as a result of these tests were combined to create ceramic objects fired at stoneware temperatures. The most interesting result of the investigation was the discovery of a number of small weathered dykes and sills, samples from which were developed into workable ceramic clay bodies and glazes using a simple empirical testing procedure. A previously unknown excellent white translucent native porcelain stone or &#8216;bai tunze&#8217; was discovered and developed into a workable porcelain body. Some iron stained porcelain bodies that &#8216;flashed&#8217; red in the wood firing kiln were also developed. Exhibitions of the creative work produced were shown in the &#8216;Legge Gallery&#8217;, a Fine Art gallery in Sydney. Two critical reviews of those shows appeared in the magazine Craft Arts International, No. 64, 2005, pp 106-107 and The Journal of Australian Ceramics, Vol 46 #1 pp 21-24. Several papers were published detailing various aspects of the research: &#8220;The Search for Raw Materials in the Southern Highlands&#8221; in The Journal of Australian Ceramics, Vol 41#3, pp 22-23; &#8220;Flotation &#8211; A method of refining useful minerals&#8221;, in The Journal of Australian Ceramics, Vol 41#3, pp 24-25; &#8220;Magic Dirt&#8221; in The Journal of Australian Ceramics, Vol 46 #1 pp 76-79; &#8220;New work from an old landscape&#8221;, in Ceramics Technical, 24, 2007. pp 45-52;&#8220;From the ground up&#8221;, in Ceramic review, issue 222, 2006, pp 54-55. The research concludes that the Southern Highlands of New South Wales is geologically rich in suitable materials for the production of stoneware ceramics and that there are a few specific bai tunze like materials that are very interesting and have considerable aesthetic potential. The research determined that these bai tunze like materials are potentially capable of being developed into clay bodies and glazes of great beauty.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ceramic materials</field><field name="subject">clay minerals</field><field name="subject">pottery</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Southern Highlands</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An engagement with the phenomenology of leadership</field><field name="creator">Jankelson, Claire</field><field name="description">The quantity of emerging literature on the subject of leadership testifies to the urgency that is felt in these times for understanding it. The phenomenon of leadership is a subtle one and each author is at pains to justify their particular slant on its nature. This thesis shifts away from trying to find essential qualities of leadership that are generically applicable and instead considers leadership as it is experienced. It therefore examines leadership as a personal phenomenon regardless of the position held. The phenomenon is recognised through the experience of those who are present to its influence. This includes the practitioner, in any role or job, for whom the experience of leadership is necessarily personal and its expression evolving rather than static. I have chosen the method of conversation to identify the presence of such a phenomenon. This provides an expansive format which, because it is a lived experience, provides access to people&#8217;s experience of leadership, both their own and that of others&#8217;. I have used reflexive and imaginative writing processes to express and develop theory and praxis. Through these means, I have examined leadership as an engagement and used myself as a presence in order to develop insight. The thesis draws on the philosophical tradition of Goethe, Husserl, Bohm and Varela to understand the nature of experience and change; qualitative researchers like Van Manen, Crotty and Reason to develop reflective tools of inquiring; and leadership thinkers such as Senge, Jaworski, Scharmer and Mintzberg to find more vital ways of considering the very human experience of leadership in these times of rapid change. The thesis showcases an evaluation of leadership in a medium-sized industrial organisation in Western Australia. The task of the study was to assess the change in leadership in the whole organisation as a result of management attending a leadership program. For this purpose, phenomenological research methods were used to provide an in-depth and experientially based methodology. Narrative analysis offered the ground for capturing the presence of leadership through expressing the whole spectrum of voices in the organisation. Further, first-person methods brought relational sensitivity and researcher engagement, immersion and leadership. The evaluation resulted in a confronting report that enabled new ways of hearing between management and non-management and the organisation was enabled to take its next steps forward consensually. The study is followed by three exploratory chapters that deal with: How does the &#8216;new&#8217; get dreamed up?     What are the big issues of leadership that challenge the establishment?     What does change actually imply and why is this so important to leadership?     I protest the flippancy with which organisational consultants and leaders confuse structural change with the change that people really desire. The crystallisation of my exploration into the phenomenon of leadership transpires through a synchronous event. This was a personal experience of leadership. I apply a classical philosophical phenomenological analysis to my story as a narrative. This results in a new theoretical framework which I have called confluential leadership: the interaction of the constellations of synchronicity, clarity of intention and co-creativeness. The appreciation of these influences within one&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;s role is a meaning-making or enhancing process. This can result in greater engagement with one&#8217;s role or perhaps the realisation that one is in the wrong job! The centrality of my own engagement, a feature of the research conducted through this thesis, has resulted in the development of a passion for the subject of leadership and an enthusiasm for the possibilities of advancing and applying many of the ideas introduced. I have found that in order to find leadership, one has to bring leadership and the quality of that intention determines what one finds. Similarly, when leadership is experienced in a workplace, others are influenced to present the best of their own leadership. There is always the possibility for each person to enhance their own experience of leadership to become more integrated, wholesome and passionate about their work. The potentiality of this excites me. Confluential is my own word and is a combination of the words consciousness and influence. It is the conscious influence of the three constellations of synchronicity, clarity of intention and co-creativeness. Each of these has been very specifically defined; their meanings are carefully discussed in the body of the thesis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">executive ability</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">executives</field><field name="subject">organizational change</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Importance of improved communication between stakeholders in information systems implementation projects</field><field name="creator">Michail, Nancy</field><field name="description">Oral communication processes in organisations are complex. Verbal interactions, social contexts including cross-functional organisational culture, and emerging information systems projects, present staff with bewildering issues to deal with through communication processes. To explore communication in this rich setting, the research reported in this thesis applied a social perspective to the functions of oral communication processes, drawing on ideas from two appropriate systems for model development, to construct a generic interpretive methodological model for participatory soft systems methodology in action research. The model aims to examine organisational social contexts through the eyes of front line staff, and attempts to construct new perspectives through actively participating and communicating with stakeholders on various levels. The situated inquiry is concerned with communication practices and behaviours in the context of implementing information systems modules in public sector, higher education institutions.The research closely examines the established communication processes and behaviours between stakeholders of the information systems enveloped within the organisation&#8217;s culture to ascertain certain issues, reasons and solutions to overcome current problems suffered by the &#8216;human element&#8217; as a whole when attempting to implement a quality information systems module to meet both direct, and indirect stakeholders expectations. Using Grounded Theory, an innovative methodological framework emerged as a result of conducting the research within the selected situated inquiry. The Progressive Learning Process model was implemented to further enhance stakeholder&#8217;s communicative behaviours and practices. This multifaceted model is comprised of interlinked, and overlapping phases; those are: (a) co-operative inquiry methods, to determine social context and culture, which included purposeful recruitment of participants, and used an assortment of methods; (b) reflections and discourse analysis, which included various processes, and counselling approach to constructing new realities and jump starting change through collaboration and open dialogue; (c) purposeful action, which included putting ideas and theory into practice to create further ideas and theory. Applying the selected methodology to the situated inquiry appears to preserve complexities of communication in organisational setting, and enhance individuals capabilities that are required when managing expectations of Senior Management.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication in organizations</field><field name="subject">information storage and retrieval systems</field><field name="subject">oral communication</field><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complementary and alternative medicine use among elite Australian athletes and the efficacy of selected complementary and alternative medicines in the prevention and treatment of delayed onset muscle soreness and muscle damage in well trained males</field><field name="creator">Pumpa, Kate Louise</field><field name="description">The use of complementary and alternative medicines and therapies (CAM) in Australia and across the world is becoming increasingly prevalent. The most recent survey conducted by MacLennon et al. in 2004 [2] identified that more than half the general Australian population had used some form of CAM in the previous 12 months before the survey was conducted.[2-4] Up until now, the prevalence of CAM use among elite Australian athletes was unknown. As athletes are constantly looking to gain an advantage over their competitors through physical or psychological interventions or through the application of new technologies, it was hypothesised that the use of CAM in this group would be higher in athletes than in the general population. After surveying 497 elite Australian athletes we found that 93% of this specific population utilised at least one CAM within their lifetime. The 10 CAM (as defined by the Therapeutics Goods Administration) used most frequently were sports drinks, massage, sports bars, cereal bars, multivitamins, aloe vera, sports gels, Pilates, caffeine and yoga. There were no significant differences identified between specific sporting groups- football codes, court sports, field sports, water sports and others, with all groups reporting high usage. Sports physicians, family, coaches and friends were identified as the main sources for product information, with health food shops, sports dieticians and sports physicians being the predominant providers of the actual product. Four CAM sold on the Australian market which purported to decrease the symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), or reported anti-inflammatory properties which could impact of the inflammatory response associated with DOMS were studied. Lyprinol&#174; (an anti-inflammatory agent), topical Arnica (for symptomatic relief of soft tissue trauma), Tienchi Ginseng (proposed to relieve symptoms of DOMS) and Devil&#8217;s Claw (an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent) were the chosen CAM. Four separate randomised, double blind placebo controlled studies comprising of 20 subjects per study were carried out with the same DOMS inducing methodology (downhill treadmill running) employed. All subjects in each of the four studies had their performance (counter movement and squat jump, maximal force), pain (visual analogue scale and muscle tenderness) and blood parameters (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-1A, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-K, creatine kinase and myoglobin) analysed seven times over five days. Lyprinol&#174; did not affect performance, pain or blood markers of muscle damage and inflammation analysed in this study. Despite Lyprinol&#174; being marketed as having &#8220;potent anti-inflammatory&#8221; properties, Lyprinol&#174; did not demonstrate any antiinflammatory properties in our sample group at a dose of 200mg daily for two months, and did not alter any of the markers of inflammation after a downhill running protocol. A significant difference was identified in quadriceps muscle tenderness between the topical Arnica and placebo groups 72 hours after the downhill running protocol. This indicated that the topical Arnica group experienced less quadriceps pain at this time point, though this was not reflected in the quadriceps visual analogue scale results. There were significant differences identified between the topical Arnica and placebo groups for muscle tenderness in the gastrocnemius and tumour necrosis factor-K concentration at baseline. Further statistical analysis assessing relative changes from baseline did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences between the groups for either of these parameters. We therefore conclude that the symptomatic relief of soft tissue trauma claimed from a topical Arnica product sold in Australia was not conclusively demonstrated in this study. The single, isolated significant difference identified in quadriceps tenderness does not conclusively, from this study, indicate efficacy for the use of this topical Arnica for the relief of soft tissue trauma. Tienchi Ginseng demonstrated the most promising outcomes, with statistically significant differences identified in performance and inflammatory markers in favour of Tienchi Ginseng. Though it cannot be conclusively deemed beneficial for DOMS from this study alone, Tienchi Ginseng warrants further research with larger sample sizes and a similar muscle damage protocol. Finally, Devil&#8217;s Claw did not demonstrate beneficial outcomes in regards to DOMS within this study. It actually demonstrated some, perhaps detrimental effects, upon analysis of performance and inflammatory markers. We are unsure of the mechanisms behind these findings, particularly when considering the proposed anti-inflammatory effects of Devil&#8217;s Claw. From the literature, Devil&#8217;s Claw appears to be beneficial in chronic musculoskeletal conditions however it does not seem to impact on muscle damage and pain resulting from DOMS inducing exercise. The questionnaire study has demonstrated that there is a high usage of CAM among elite Australian athletes, an area up until now that has been unexplored. The onset of CAM use within the Australian athletic population, and the prevalence of CAM use by other professional Australian athletes would be an area to explore in the future. In regards to products which specifically claim to benefit athletes suffering soft tissue trauma such as DOMS, convincing evidence for specific product use was not demonstrated in these studies. Further research involving greater sample sizes may reveal more definitive outcomes, specifically in regards to the use of Tienchi Ginseng.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alternative medicine</field><field name="subject">sports medicine</field><field name="subject">athletes</field><field name="subject">herbs</field><field name="subject">traditional medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic methods for Rapid Detection of Medically Important Nosocomial Bactera</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Lee</field><field name="description">Master of Science</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nosocomial infection</field><field name="subject">Bacterial resistance</field><field name="subject">Genetic methods for resistance detection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HUSSERL'S LATER THINKING CONVERGING INTO A PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY OR THE THEME OF HISTORICAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN HUSSERL'S LATER WRITINGS ESPECIALLY IN  THE CRISIS OF EUROPEAN SCIENCES</field><field name="creator">Ryanto, Paulus</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Edmund Husserl</field><field name="subject">Philosophy of History</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3576</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of Airway Remodelling</field><field name="creator">Boustany, Sarah</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Airway remodelling</field><field name="subject">Angiogenesis</field><field name="subject">Lymphangioleiomyomatosis</field><field name="subject">Tumstatin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the p14ARF Tumour Suppressor in Promoting Apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Gallagher, Stuart John</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">p14ARF</field><field name="subject">Melanoma</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Tumour suppressor</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE TERRESTRIAL ECOLOGY OF A FRESHWATER TURTLE, CHELODINA LONGICOLLIS, IN BOODEREE NATIONAL PARK, AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Roe, John H.</field><field name="description">Most studies of wetlands tend to focus on the biotic and abiotic interactions within the aquatic habitat. Though wetlands and associated biota may appear to be somewhat isolated from the influence of the wider landscape, wetland habitats are critically linked with adjacent terrestrial habitats and other wetlands through the two-way flows of energy and nutrients and provision of structure. While an understanding of these inter-habitat linkages is breaking down the perceived boundaries between &amp;quotaquatic" and &amp;quotterrestrial" ecosystems, there is more limited knowledge on the ecology of wetland animals that must meet critical needs in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats at some time during their life or seasonal cycles. Here, I examine the terrestrial ecology of a freshwater turtle, the eastern long-necked turtle (Chelodina longicollis) in the temporally dynamic and heterogeneous landscape of Booderee national park in south-east Australia by 1) providing a description of terrestrial behaviours, 2) identifying the factors driving terrestrial behaviour and its functional significance, 3) examining factors that may limit or constrain terrestrial behaviour and 4) demonstrating how various terrestrial behaviours can factor prominently in the overall biology of a nominally aquatic animal.
Chelodina longicollis used terrestrial habitats for reasons other than nesting, including aestivation and movements between wetlands. Radio-telemetry of 60 turtles revealed that nearly 25 % of all locations were in terrestrial habitats up to 505 m from the wetland, where turtles remained for extended periods (up to 480 consecutive days) buried under sand and leaf litter in the forest. Individuals also maintained an association with a permanent lake and at least one temporary wetland within 1470 m, though some inter-wetland dispersal movements were much longer (5248 m). As a result of their associations with several wetlands and terrestrial aestivation sites, C. longicollis traversed large areas and long distances (13.8 +/- 2.8 ha home range, 2608 +/- 305 m moved), indicating that this species is highly vagile. In fact, a three-year capture-mark-recapture study conducted in 25 wetlands revealed that 33% of the population moved overland between wetlands. After scaling this rate to the number of generations elapsed during the study, C. longicollis moved between discrete water bodies at a rate of 88-132% per generation. This rate is not only high for freshwater turtles, but is among the highest rates of inter-patch movement for any vertebrate or invertebrate.
Chelodina longicollis demonstrated an impressive capacity for individual variation in nearly every aspect of its behaviour examined. Most of the variation in space use, movements, terrestrial aestivation and activity could be attributed to extrinsic local and landscape factors, seasonal influences and rainfall, whereas intrinsic attributes of the individual such as sex, body size, body condition and maturity status were less important.
Turtles increased movement distance and home range size in regions where inter-wetland distances were farther and with increasing wetland size. Individuals spent more time in terrestrial habitats with decreasing wetland hydroperiod and increasing distance to the nearest permanent lake. Overland movements between wetlands were correlated with rainfall, but the directionality of these movements and the frequency with which they occurred varied according to the prevalent rainfall patterns; movements were to permanent lakes during drought, but turtles returned to temporary wetlands en masse upon the return of heavy rainfall. However, deteriorating conditions in drying wetlands forced turtles to move even in the absence of rainfall. Captures at a terrestrial drift fence revealed that immature turtles as small as 72.3 mm plastron length may move overland between wetlands with similar frequency as larger adults. Taken together, these results suggest that C. longicollis behaviour is in part conditional or state-dependent (i.e., plastic) and shaped by the spatiotemporal variation and heterogeneity of the landscape.
Perhaps the most surprising aspect of individual variation was the alternate responses to wetland drying. Turtles either aestivated in terrestrial habitats (for variable lengths of time), or moved to other wetlands. Movement to other wetlands was the near universal strategy when only a short distance from permanent lakes, but the proportion of individuals that aestivated terrestrially increased with distance to the nearest permanent lake. When long distances must be travelled, both behaviours were employed by turtles in the same wetland, suggesting that individuals differentially weigh the costs and benefits of residing terrestrially versus those of long-distance movement. I propose that diversity in response to wetland drying in the population is maintained by stochastic fluctuations in resource quality. The quality of temporary wetlands relative to permanent wetlands at our study site varies considerably and unpredictably with annual rainfall and with it the cost-benefit ratio of each strategy or tactic. Residency in or near temporary wetlands is more successful during wet periods due to production benefits (high growth, reproduction and increased body condition), but movement to permanent wetlands is more successful, or least costly, during dry periods due to the fitness benefits of increased survival and body condition.
I used the doubly-labelled water (DLW) method to provide the first estimates of water and energy costs of aestivation and overland movement for any freshwater turtle behaving naturally in the field. Chelodina longicollis remained hydrated while terrestrial with water flux rates (14.3-19.3 ml kg-1 d-1) on par with those of strictly terrestrial turtles, but field metabolic rate during aestivation (20.0-24.6 kJ kg-1 d-1) did not indicate substantial physiological specializations in metabolism during aestivation. Energy reserves, but not water, are predicted to limit survival in aestivation to an estimated 49-261 days, which is in
close agreement with the durations of natural aestivation. The energy costs of overland movement were 46-99 kJ (kg d)-1, or 1.6-1.7 times more expensive than aestivation. When a wetland dries, a turtle that foregoes movement to other wetlands can free sufficient energy to fuel up to 134 days in aestivation. The increasing value of this energy &amp;quottrade-off" with travel distance fits our behavioural observations of variance in response to wetland drying.
Taken together, this evidence indicates that terrestrial habitats provide more than just organic and structural inputs and filtering services and that nearby wetlands are important for reasons other than potential sources of occasional colonists to a population. Terrestrial habitats are used for aestivation in response to wetland drying and different wetlands are diverse in their functions of meeting the annual or life-cycle requirements of C. longicollis in temporally dynamic wetland systems. As overland movements between these various habitat types are in response to spatiotemporal variation in habitat quality and associated shifts in the fitness gradient between them, I suggest that terrestrial and different aquatic habitats in Booderee offer complementary resources contributing to regional carrying capacity and population persistence of the turtle population. Thus, important ecological processes regulating C. longicollis in a focal wetland should not be viewed as operating independently of other nearby wetlands and their adjacent terrestrial habitats. Collectively, these findings highlight the complex and dynamic associations between a population of freshwater turtles and the wider terrestrial and aquatic landscape, demonstrating that turtle populations and the factors that impact them can extend well beyond the boundaries of a focal wetland.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">C. longicollis</field><field name="subject">wetlands</field><field name="subject">ecosystem</field><field name="subject">freshwater turtle</field><field name="subject">eastern long-necked turtle</field><field name="subject">Chelodina longicollis</field><field name="subject">Booderee national park</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">terrestrial ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081009.143208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models as mindtools for environmental education: How do students use models to learn about a complex socio-environmental system?</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Kate</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="subject">educational psychology</field><field name="subject">learning with pre-built models</field><field name="subject">collaborative learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/3608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lexical tone perception and production : the role of language and musical background</field><field name="creator">Schwanha&#776;u&#946;er, Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the perception and production of lexical tone. In the first experiment, categorical perception of asymmetric synthetic tone continua was examined in speakers of tonal (Thai, Mandarin, and Vietnamese) and non-tonal (Australian English) languages. It was observed that perceptual strategies for categorisation depend on language background. Specifically, Mandarin and Vietnamese listeners tended to use the central tone to divide the continuum, whereas Thai and Australian English listeners used a flat no-contour tone as a perceptual anchor; a split based not on tonal vs. non-tonal language background, but rather on the specific language. In the second experiment, tonal (Thai) and non-tonal (Australian English) language speaking musicians and non-musicians were tested on categorical perception of two differently shaped synthetic tone continua. Results showed that, independently of language background, musicians learn to identify tones more quickly, show steeper identification functions, and display higher discrimination accuracy than non-musicians. Experiment three concerns the influence of language aptitude, musical aptitude, musical memory, and musical training on Australian English speakers&#8223; perception and production of non-native (Thai) tones, consonants, and vowels. The results showed that musicians were better than non-musicians at perceiving and producing tones and consonants; a ceiling effect was observed for vowel perception. Musical training per se did not determine acquisition of novel speech sounds, rather, musicians&#8223; higher accuracy was explained by a combination of inherent abilities - language and musical aptitude for consonants, and musical aptitude and musical memory for tones. It is concluded that tone perception is language dependent and strongly influenced by musical expertise - musical aptitude and musical memory, not musical training as such.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grammar</field><field name="subject">grammar, comparative and general</field><field name="subject">phonology</field><field name="subject">tone</field><field name="subject">tone (phonetics)</field><field name="subject">music and language</field><field name="subject">language and languages</field><field name="subject">generative grammar</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Picturing currere towards c u r a: Rhizo-imaginary for curriculum</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Warren William</field><field name="description">This critical inquiry in curriculum studies uses poststructuralist and Deleuzian rhizomatic approaches alongside an original 'picturing' methodology.

However, a large and growing number of people in the West now practice some form of yoga, with more than 80% of practitioners being women. Since the 1980s, there has been a &#8216;feminisation&#8217; of yoga in the West, as female teachers and practitioners tailor its practice to meet the specific needs of women. The practice of yoga has also changed to meet the needs of the modern Western practitioner more generally, such that the primary reasons for practicing yoga are to improve physical well-being and to cope with stress. Nonetheless, for some practitioners, yoga continues to offer philosophical and spiritual direction. The aim of this thesis is to critically examine mid-aged women&#8217;s experiences of Iyengar yoga. Focusing on a select group of 35 women living in New South Wales, Australia, the study ultimately seeks to determine whether a process of self-transformation arises from their yoga practice. Bourdieu&#8217;s concept of habitus provides a very useful context for describing the study participants&#8217; shared disposition and values. The women&#8217;s demographic characteristics, for example, help explain why they were attracted to and maintained a regular yoga practice. An aspect of their habitus is also distinctly feminine, incorporating values of connectedness and holism. The women&#8217;s experiences were examined to consider why they were practicing yoga. In an exploration of the processes that emerged from the women&#8217;s experiences of Iyengar yoga, a paradox arose concerning the nature of &#8216;the Self&#8217; that is depicted by yoga philosophy, and &#8216;the self&#8217; that is portrayed in modern societies. To examine how ideals from the West and the East have come together in the modern practice of yoga, the women&#8217;s experiences are compared here with Giddens&#8217; &#8216;reflexive project of the self&#8217; (a process of self-actualisation) and the broader principles of classical yoga (a process of self-realisation). Western practices, like Giddens&#8217; project, emphasise processes of &#8216;becoming&#8217;: a means to perpetually progress and improve oneself. Eastern practices, however, give priority to states of &#8216;being&#8217;, via the cultivation of awareness to attain experiences of constancy and stillness within. The women&#8217;s stories and experiences are integral to understanding the processes of self-transformation that arise from their yoga practice. Their experiences demonstrate that although initially reasons for practicing yoga identify primarily with Giddens&#8217; reflexive project (&#8216;becoming&#8217;), through the practice of yoga their experiences become embodied (&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;being&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;). The thesis explores the evolving interplay between &#8216;being&#8217; and &#8216;becoming&#8217; that ensues from experiences of Iyengar yoga, and explains how and why these processes of self-transformation impact on the lives of the women interviewed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Iyengar yoga</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">experiences</field><field name="subject">self-transformation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ways of Knowing in the Anglican Eucharistic Tradition: Ramifications for Theological Education</field><field name="creator">Douglas, Brian Ernest</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns ways of knowing in the Anglican eucharistic tradition. It also explores the ramifications of these ways of knowing for theological education in the Anglican tradition of Christianity. The thesis uses Anglican eucharistic theology as a source of case study, and attempts, using a methodology of phenomenology to examine critically the particular interests and philosophical assumptions underlying eucharistic theology in the Anglican tradition from the time of the Reformation to the present day. Phenomenology is chosen as the methodology since it allows access to the diverse experience of the Anglican eucharistic tradition, suspending judgment until a later time when essences are extracted from the case studies. This has the potential to avoid exclusive commitments to particular technical and hermeneutic interests within Anglicanism while at the same time recognising the multiformity of the Anglican eucharistic tradition and fostering a critical approach to the examination of the experience of the Anglican eucharistic tradition and Anglican theological education. In examining ways of knowing in the Anglican tradition, the thesis acknowledges the usefulness for eucharistic theology and theological education of philosophical enquiry. The three ways of knowing (technical, hermeneutic and critical) proposed by the philosopher, Jurgen Habermas (1971 and 1973) are used to assist in understanding the knowledge of the Anglican eucharistic tradition presented in the case studies. The further insights of Habermas (1984 and 1989) are used in recommending a dialogue approach, based on the intersubjectivity of communicative action, for theological education concerned with the teaching of eucharistic theology in the Anglican tradition. Philosophical reflection is also employed in an examination of the underlying philosophical assumptions of the case studies of eucharistic theology in the Anglican tradition. A model of the Anglican eucharistic tradition based on the philosophical concepts of realism and nominalism, to both the moderate and immoderate degrees is developed and proposed as a way of promoting a critical interest in the Anglican eucharistic tradition beyond the merely technical or hermeneutic interests commonly found in various church parties of the Anglican Communion. The work of the Australian philosopher David Armstrong (1989, 1995, 1997 and 2004) is foundational to the development of a model for the Anglican eucharistic tradition and the examination of its experience in the case studies. The principal findings of the study suggest that the prevailing essence of the Anglican eucharistic tradition is a multiformity of eucharistic doctrine, such that eucharistic theology is most often expressed using the philosophical assumptions of realism and nominalism to the moderate degree and according to varying technical and hermeneutic interests. The thesis also seeks to draw out the educational implications of these differing ways of knowing for theological education in the Anglican tradition and specifically for the teaching of eucharistic theology. The principal recommendation of the thesis for theological education is the application of a dialogue approach in the teaching of eucharistic theology in Anglican theological education, where dialogue involves the development of an ideal communicative community in which participants seek shared meaning on the basis of the intersubjectivity of communicative action.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anglican</field><field name="subject">Eucharist</field><field name="subject">Theological Education</field><field name="subject">Habermas</field><field name="subject">communicative action</field><field name="subject">philosophical assumptions</field><field name="subject">realism</field><field name="subject">nominalism</field><field name="subject">Armstrong</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-Mode Damping of Power System Oscillations</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Edward Walter</field><field name="description">In maintaining power system stability; especially that of large interconnected systems, in the face of large disturbances it is desirable to have a non-linear control technique that is simple and inexpensive to implement. This thesis presents a non-linear control technique which relies on angle measurements taken at strategic points in the power system with the aid of the G.P.S. ( Global Positioning System ) timing signal. A method for estimating these bus angles which is faster than previous methods is developed as well as a technique for choosing the locations of these transducers. This transducer placement algorithm aims to place transducers at locations whose bus voltage response to the less well damped inter-area modes is maximised and whose response to the better damped local modes is minimised. Since the control techniques are based on aggregated classical models of coherent generators it is important to be able to estimate the internal voltages of these aggregate machines. The placement algorithm ensures maximally precise angle estimates in the presence of noise by minimising the condition number of the observation matrix relating transducer bus voltages to internal aggregated machine voltages. The non-linear control techniques presented rely on an energy function developed in this thesis which is based on the physical circuit energy of the system. One technique; the Direct Energy technique looks at maximising the negativity of the time rate of change of the energy function, assuming that the energy function is positive during the time frame of interest. It is shown that should the number of controllers be less than the number of modes, excluding the centre of area mode, then sustained oscillations appear which will only be damped by the natural damping of the system. This may be overcome by using techniques which rely on reducing the entire system energy over the time frame of interest. These so-called Lookahead techniques can rely on higher order time derivatives of the energy function or on co-states, the latter being the principal focus of this thesis. The Lookahead control technique developed is based on co-states which are estimated by the using the solution to the time independent Ricatti equation for a LQ model of the system. It is shown to produce good damping in a number of case studies. Furthermore it is shown to perform well in the presence of both static and dynamic load models. Also it is shown that the path dependent terms introduce some ambiguity as to whether or not the system will converge to a stable equilibrium point. It is shown that it is possible to put a bound on the region to which the power system can be assured to converge. Furthermore the addition of the above-mentioned control strategies has the effect of overcoming the effect of the path dependent terms and, should the control action be strong enough, completely swamping them and ensuring system convergence to a stable operating point. In any case the energy function could be directly monitored since all the data needed is being collected anyway for control purposes.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">power system stability</field><field name="subject">non-linear control</field><field name="subject">Lyapunov Functions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality of Life and Attendance in Primary Schools</field><field name="creator">Leonard, Carl Anthony Robert</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents the results of a study to assess the impact of a stress management, a self-development, and a relaxation technique on the quality of school life and attendance of 448 Year 5 and 6 students in 16 classes at 4 Lower Hunter Valley primary schools in New South Wales, Australia, in 2000. The importance of contextualising student quality of school life as a key indicator of school effectiveness and measure of school improvement is also argued.  The Quality of School Life questionnaire (Ainley &amp; Bourke, 1992) scales were used pre- and post- intervention as indicators of student perception of aspects of their school life including stressful and satisfying elements. Various student, teacher, and class contextual variables were also investigated.  Overall, the interventions implemented in this study appeared to have had some small impact on student quality of school life, student absence, teacher stress, teacher satisfaction, and teacher absence. Of particular interest are the apparent differential effects of some of the interventions for: teachers and students, classes, schools, and, at least in part, the effectiveness of the implementation of the interventions. Possible explanations of these differences are discussed while implications including the apparent importance of positive peer relationships and an exciting and enjoyable curriculum in ensuring students have a high quality of school life are described. In the broader context of school effectiveness and school improvement, it is hoped that further investigation will be undertaken of the intervention strategies explored and refined in this study, and perhaps other strategies intended to enhance student quality of school life. In particular, interventions are needed that facilitate the establishment of classroom environments where students and teachers want to be, where educational outcomes are enhanced, and students are led to a broader life experience.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quality of School Life</field><field name="subject">Attendance</field><field name="subject">School Effectiveness</field><field name="subject">School Improvement</field><field name="subject">School Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Affective Outcomes of Schooling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporal Sodium Flux In A Woodlot Soil Irrigated With Secondary Treated Effluent: The Implications For Sustainable Irrigation And Soil Management</field><field name="creator">Lucas, Steven Andrew</field><field name="description">This study reports results obtained and the approach taken in investigating the temporal sodium flux in a woodlot soil receiving secondary treated effluent at Branxton, NSW. Previous research has shown woodlot soils receiving secondary treated effluent undergo an increase in exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) over time. Increased soil ESP influences micro-aggregate/soil pore stability and, particularly when subject to irrigation waters of specific low-electrolyte concentrations, results in decreased soil permeability and a subsequent need to reduce effluent application rates. Therefore, in irrigated woodlot soils it has been necessary to implement strategies to remove excess sodium from the root zone to maintain optimum permeability of the receiving soil, that is, maintaining the cation balance (as soil ESP) to promote optimum soil pore size. To maintain optimum permeability, an understanding is needed of temporal variations in the accumulation/leaching (flux) of sodium within a soil under secondary treated effluent irrigated conditions. The ability to define the sodium flux depends on the frequency of soil sampling and the ability to interpret the net loss/gain in soil sodium in relation to the applied hydraulic load over time. Past research has measured changes in soil ESP on an annual basis, or longer, making it impossible to interpret temporal sodium flux within a given year. The rate of change of soil ESP has ramifications for optimum permeability within an effluent irrigated woodlot. With respect to increasing/decreasing soil ESP, a major response of the clay particles within micro-aggregates is the deformation of conducting soil pores and reduced hydraulic conductivities. In addition, clay dispersion is governed by the soil ESP and electrolyte concentration of the infiltrating waters at the time, where dispersed clay particles may block conducting soil pores and further reduce hydraulic conductivity. Therefore, investigating the temporal sodium flux in conjunction with the temporal variation in electrolyte concentration of infiltrating waters will give greater insight into the response of effluent irrigated soils to sodium-rich waters over time. Three research aims were formed to investigate temporal sodium flux. These include: 1. To investigate trends in the dominant water balance components for a woodlot soil receiving secondary treated effluent (STE); 2. To examine temporal and spatial variation in both the water balance components and measured soil properties, particularly the sodium flux; and 3. To investigate the implications of the sodium flux on the loss of soil structure and drainage over time (dispersion events), particularly in relation to temporal changes in soil ESP and effluent SAR. Monitoring programs for water balance components and soil parameters covered the period January 2002 &#8211; October 2003. Every two months, soil samples were taken at designated sites and at different depths (10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 cm). These samples were analysed for exchangeable cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+), from which the ESP values were derived. Also, this appears to be the first time that soil sampling at this frequency, which enables the temporal sodium flux to be determined, has been carried out. Column leaching experiments were also performed over the study period to illustrate the response of the woodlot soil, in terms of micro-aggregate stability, to hydraulic loads of varying SAR. Column leaching experiments also confirmed the rate of solute movement through the soil profile and the woodlot soil&#8217;s ability to bind/exchange sodium under different hydraulic loads and electrolyte concentrations. Soil extraction plate methods were used to determine wilting point and field capacity for these soils. The Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), which is the solutional equivalent to soil ESP, was used to define the electrolyte concentration of the applied effluent and rainfall to the woodlot. The net loss/gain of exchangeable sodium at different depths and times was determined and compared with changes in water balance components and the measured volumetric soil water over time. The soil water surplus/deficit was recorded at a daily time-step and a cumulative approach was used to determine the long-term soil water surplus/deficit. In addition, variations in groundwater levels were monitored to observe if surplus irrigation events were reflected in temporal trends. As a result of determining the temporal variation in soil ESP, effluent and rainfall SAR, daily soil water deficit/surplus (short-term), cumulative soil water deficit/surplus (long-term) and volumetric soil moisture, temporal trends are presented. The sodium flux was then investigated by interpreting trends in the monitored data with respect to the dominant water balance components. All parameters were then used to model the potential dispersive behaviour of the receiving soil over time and depth, in relation to the volume and electrolyte concentration of the effluent and rainfall applied over time. The implications for soil structure and permeability depend on variations in soil ESP and effluent SAR. Results from this research show that soil ESP varied by as much as 24% over a four-month period and is shown to be a function of the sodium loading (from STE) and soil water surplus/deficit. On each sampling occasion, soil ESP generally increased with depth at all irrigated sites. Soil ESP at non-irrigated sites was much lower than irrigated sites, although the variability in soil ESP was much greater. Variations in SAR of the waters received by the woodlot soil (effluent and rainfall) over the study period ranged from 0.5 to 5.9. It is shown that the SAR range, coupled with variations in soil ESP, has ramifications for maintaining long-term soil structure. Soil structure at different sites within a woodlot will respond differently according to the soil ESP/effluent SAR relationship. The dispersive potential of soil at a given ESP receiving irrigation waters of known SAR was assessed in light of the relationship between soil ESP and effluent SAR. This showed the dynamic response of effluent irrigated soils to the long-term temporal variation in electrolyte concentration of rainfall/effluent. The relationship between soil ESP and effluent SAR is graphically presented as a continuum, which in turn can be used as a management tool for assessing the potential for dispersion of clay particles in a soil of known ESP and irrigated with waters of known SAR. By identifying trends in the temporal sodium flux, the optimum permeability of the receiving soil can be assessed in relation to the electrolyte concentration of the applied waters and the soil exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). Secondary treated effluent application rates can then be corrected to prevent &#8220;dispersive&#8221; irrigation events over the long term and/or management strategies applied to remove excess sodium from the soil profile. The significance of the research is that a better understanding of the temporal dynamics of sodium in the soil profile will allow improved management of effluent irrigated woodlots, with the aim of making the practice sustainable with respect to controlling accumulating soil sodium and maintaining soil structure for future landuse.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sodium flux</field><field name="subject">effluent irrigation</field><field name="subject">soil management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Historical Perpsective On the Academic Education Of Deaf Children In New South Wales 1860s-1990s</field><field name="creator">Crickmore, Barbara Lee</field><field name="description">This is an historical investigation into the provision of education services for deaf children in the State of New South Wales in Australia since 1860.  The main focus is those deaf children without additional disabilities who have been placed in mainstream classes, special classes for the deaf and special schools for the deaf.  The study places this group at centre stage in order to better understand their educational situation in the late 1990s.  The thesis has taken a chronological and thematic approach. The chapters are defined by significant events that impacted on the education of the deaf, such as the establishment of special schools in New South Wales, the rise of the oral movement, and aftermath of the rubella epidemic in Australia during the 1940s.  Within each chapter, there is a core of key elements around which the analysis is based.  These key elements tend to be based on institutions, players, and specific educational features, such as the mode of instruction or the curriculum.  The study found general agreement that language acquisition was a fundamental prerequisite to academic achievement.  Yet the available evidence suggests that educational programs for most deaf children in New South Wales have seldom focused on ensuring adequate language acquisition in conjunction with the introduction of academic subjects.  As a result, language and literacy competencies of deaf students in general have frequently been acknowledged as being below those of five their hearing counterparts, to the point of presenting a barrier to successful post-secondary study.  It is proposed that the reasons for the academic failings of the deaf are inherent in five themes.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">deaf</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">government policies</field><field name="subject">Education Acts</field><field name="subject">Catholic education</field><field name="subject">non-government special schools</field><field name="subject">special education</field><field name="subject">special needs</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">deaf culture</field><field name="subject">schools for the deaf</field><field name="subject">integration</field><field name="subject">inclusion</field><field name="subject">Opportunity Deaf (OD) classes</field><field name="subject">hearing support classes</field><field name="subject">special classes</field><field name="subject">teacher training</field><field name="subject">Australian Association of Teachers of the Deaf (AATD)</field><field name="subject">Itinerant teachers</field><field name="subject">correspondence school</field><field name="subject">normalisation</field><field name="subject">eugenics</field><field name="subject">rubella epidemics</field><field name="subject">hearing-aids</field><field name="subject">hearing-imparied</field><field name="subject">oral language</field><field name="subject">Signed English</field><field name="subject">sign language</field><field name="subject">Auslan</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity, Image and Meaning Beyond the Classroom: Visual and Performative Communicative Practice in a Visual 21st Century</field><field name="creator">Grushka, Kathryn Meyer</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate -

Species in South-Eastern New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Hunter, David</field><field name="description">The decline and extinction of amphibian species over the past three decades is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest biodiversity crises of modem time. Providing convincing data to support hypotheses about these declines has proved difficult, which has greatly restricted the development and implementation of management actions that may prevent further amphibian declines and extinctions from occurring. In this thesis, I present research that was undertaken as part of the recovery programs for the southern corroboree frog (Pseudophryne corroboree), and the Booroolong frog (Litoria booroolongensis); two species that underwent very rapid declines in distribution and abundance during the 1980's. More specifically, I investigated potential causal factors in the declines of both species using experimental and correlative studies, and examined the mechanisms by which one threatening process (chytridiomycosis) may be causing continued decline and extinction in P. corroboree. I also examined the implications of population dynamics for monitoring L. booroolongensis, and suggest a possible monitoring strategy that may reliably facilitate the implementation of recovery objectives for this species. I also tested one possible reintroduction technique aimed at preventing the continued decline and extinction of P. corroboree populations.
In Chapters 2 and 3, I present the results from a series of experiments in artificial enclosures designed to examine whether the tadpoles of L. booroolongensis are susceptible to predation by co-occurring introduced predatory fish species; brown trout (Salmo trutta), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), European carp (Cyprinus carpio), redfin perch (Percafluviatilis), and mosquito fish (Gambusia holbrooki). I demonstrated that the tadpoles of L. booroolongensis, and a closely related species Litoria lesueuri, were palatable to non-native trout species, but not to two native predatory fish species, Gadopsis bispinosus and Galaxias olidus. A pond breeding frog species included in this experiment, Limnodynastes tasmaniensis, was palatable to both the native and non-native fish species. In a separate experiment I also demonstrated that the tadpole of L. booroolongensis is palatable to the three other introduced fish species examined in this study; C. carpio, P. fluviatilis, and G. holbrooki. In three of the experiments, the provision of rock within enclosures as a potential refuge habitat did not afford protection to L. booroolongensis tadpoles from
predation by any of the five introduced fish species examined. While all the introduced fish species tested here did consume L. booroolongensis tadpoles, the results also suggested that chemical unpalatability might afford some level of protection against some of these fish species. Firstly, the addition of alternative prey items in one of the experiments reduced the proportion of tadpoles consumed, suggesting that L. booroolongensis may not be a preferred prey item. Secondly, the proportion of tadpoles consumed varied greatly among the different fish species examined, suggesting differing levels of palatability. Overall, this study supports previous research in suggesting that chemical unpalatability may be an important strategy for the tadpoles of riverine frog species in south-eastern Australia to avoid predation by native fish species, and that this strategy is less effective against introduced fish species. While L. booroolongensis currently persists in streams inhabited by a number of introduced fish species, this study supports the likelihood that these species are having a negative impact on populations of L. booroolongensis in the wild.
In Chapter 4, I present the results of a study aimed at examining potential monitoring techniques for L. booroolongensis. The results of a mark-recapture exercise demonstrated that L. booroolongensis may exhibit large fluctuations in abundance from one year to the next, and through a prospective power analysis approach, I demonstrated that it would be difficult to confidently identify population trends of interest using either indices or estimates of abundance for this species. An assessment of the capacity to identify the presence or absence of L. booroolongensis using nighttime
spotlight surveys demonstrated the high detectability of this species using this technique, at both the scale of 300-meter sections of stream and individual breeding areas (typically less than 10-meters of stream). This study suggests that the monitoring objectives of the L. booroolongensis recovery program would be most effectively achieved using presence/absence surveys at different scales.
In Chapter 5, I present the results of a field survey aimed at determining the current distribution and habitat requirements of L. booroolongensis in the South West Slopes region of New South Wales. Of the 163 sites I surveyed across 49 streams,I located
L. booroolongensis along 77 of these sites from 27 streams. Based on population and habitat connectivity, this study identified 18 populations of L. booroolongensis that
are likely to be operating as independent populations. Twelve of these populations are not represented in conservation reserves, but rather occur along streams that flow through the agricultural landscape. A broad scale habitat analysis identified a positive relationship between extent of rock structures along the stream and the occurrence of
L. booroolongensis, and a negative relationship between the proportion of canopy cover and this species' occurrence. At the breeding habitat scale, this study identified a positive relationship between the presence of breeding males and; number of rock crevices in the aquatic environment, extent of emergent rocks, and proportion pool. This analysis also detected a negative relationship between occupancy and water depth. These results confirm previous work suggesting the importance of rocky stream habitats to the persistence of L. booroolongensis, but also suggest how disturbance processes, such as increasing sedimentation and weed invasion, may reduce the suitability of rocky structures as breeding sites.
In Chapter 6, I investigated current levels of amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) infection in corroboree frog populations, and used retrospective screening of museum specimens to assess the possibility that this pathogen was implicated in the initial decline of the corroboree frogs. Using histology, I did not detect any B. dendrobatidis infections in corroboree frog populations prior to their decline, however using the same technique, moderate levels of infection were detected in post-decline populations of both species. Real-time PCR screening of skin swabs identified much higher overall infection rates in post-decline populations of P. corroboree (between 44% and 59%), while significantly lower rates of infection were observed in P. pengilleyi populations (14%). These results suggest that the initial and continued decline of the corroboree frogs may well be attributed to the emergence of B. dendrobatidis in populations of these species.
In Chapter 7, I investigated how B. dendrobatidis may be causing the continued decline of P. corroboree through the presence of an abundant reservoir host for this pathogen. I found that populations of adult C. signifera in sub-alpine bogs carry high
B. dendrobatidis infection rates (86%), but appear unaffected by this infection. An experiment involving the release of P. corroboree tadpoles into 15 natural pools resulted in metamorphs from seven of these pools testing positive for B. dendrobatidis, with all these individuals dying soon after metamorphosis. These
results support the possibility that B. dendrobatidis infection in P. corroboree populations is being facilitated by the presence of large numbers of infected C. signifera in the shared environment.
Chapter 8 presents the results of a population augmentation study for P. corroboree. I investigated the extent to which increasing recruitment to metamorphosis may result in population recovery in this species. This was undertaken by harvesting eggs from the field and rearing them through to mid stage tadpoles over the winter period prior to being released back to their natal ponds in spring. While I was able to increase recruitment to metamorphosis by an average of 20 percent, this did not result in a noticeable influence on the subsequent adult population size, as both manipulated and non-manipulated sites declined over the course of this study by an average of 80 percent. I observed a positive relationship between natural recruitment to a late tadpole stage and subsequent adult male population size, however there was considerable variation associated with this relationship. The relationship between recruitment and subsequent population size at the augmentation sites was consistent with the relationship observed at the non-manipulated sites. These results suggest that recruitment to metamorphosis may not be the most important life stage restricting the population recovery of P. corroboree, but that mortality during post-metamorphic stages may be more important in regulating current population size. Hence, further attempts to use captive rearing to increase P. corroboree populations in the wild should focus on the release of post-metamorphic frogs.
Overall, this thesis demonstrates the value of quantitative research to the implementation and progress of threatened species recovery programs. While this research will specifically contribute to the recovery programs for L. booroolongensis
and P. corroboree, it more broadly contributes to the understanding and capacity to respond to the concerning levels of amphibian extinctions currently occurring throughout the world.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">southern corroboree frog (Pseudophryne corroboree)</field><field name="subject">Booroolong frog (Litoria booroolongensis)</field><field name="subject">south east Australia</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">frog</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081020.142239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemistry at cadmium sulfide surfaces</field><field name="creator">Young, Aidan Gerard</field><field name="description">Probing the surface chemistry of thiol ligand binding to cadmium chalcogenide nanoparticles is important to clarify factors involved in quantum dot stability and surface functionalisation. This research is a spectroscopic investigation aimed at gaining a better understanding of the interaction/bonding of various ligands to CdS, with respect to the use of CdS in biological imaging. The findings of this research are important to the more general field of cadmium chalcogenide materials as biological imaging agents. 
 Deposited CdS nanoparticle films were used in this work as model quantum dot surfaces for ligand adsorption studies. The adsorption of the monothiol-containing ligands, mercaptoacetic acid, mercaptopropionic acid, and mercaptoethanol, to CdS thin films were studied in situ using attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy. The absence of an S-H stretch absorption for the adsorbed species showed that adsorption occurred via the deprotonated thiol group. 
 The adsorption of the dithiol-containing ligands &#945;-lipoic acid, dihydrolipoic acid, and dithiothreitol to CdS nanoparticle films was investigated. The adsorption of dihydrolipoic acid and dithiothreitol was found to occur via both thiol functional groups and an additional interaction between the carboxylate group and the CdS surface. The adsorption of &#945;-lipoic acid to CdS in the presence of light proceeded with photo-oxidation of the CdS surface and reductive cleavage of the disulfide bond of &#945;-lipoic acid to produce some adsorbed dihydrolipoic acid and thiosulfate. The adsorption of &#945;-lipoic acid to CdS in the absence of visible light showed no photo-oxidation, and suggested adsorption occurred via retention of the disulfide bond. 
 The kinetics of adsorption and desorption of oxalic acid on deposited anatase TiO&#8322; films were studied to investigate the feasibility of extracting molecular information from attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopic kinetic data of ligand processes on deposited particle films. Oxalic acid adsorbed on anatase TiO&#8322; is a well-studied example and is reported to result in three different surface species. The profile of the desorption data indicated contributions from three different components. Different component contributions were unable to be obtained from the adsorption data which is attributed to adsorption occurring much faster than desorption and thus being relatively insensitive to the presence of different adsorbed species. 
 The kinetics of adsorption and desorption of mercaptoacetic acid on CdS were investigated. The desorption data profile indicated the presence of two adsorbed species with different affinities for the CdS surface, the exact chemical nature of which can only be speculated upon given the absence of distinguishing IR spectral features. 
 Ligand exchange reactions at the surface of oleate and trioctylphosphine oxide-capped CdS quantum dot films were investigated. Adsorbed oleate was coordinated to the CdS in a chelating bidentate manner through the carboxylate functional group, while adsorbed trioctylphosphine oxide was coordinated though the P=O functional group. Ligand exchange reactions on the oleate and trioctylphosphine-capped CdS films were studied, and exchange with monothiol-containing ligands was observed only at solution pH where the exchanging ligand was uncharged. 
 Avidin-biotin bioconjugation reactions were carried out on CdS films, which involved the sequential adsorption of mercaptoacetic acid, the protein avidin, and the subsequent binding of the ligand biotin. The spectral data suggested that avidin underwent a conformational change upon adsorption to the CdS surface. This conformation appeared to be perturbed again upon binding of biotin, and it is speculated that the conformation partially reverted back to the native solution conformation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">sulfides</field><field name="subject">surface chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080806.164202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatially-structured niching methods for evolutionary algorithms</field><field name="creator">Dick, Grant</field><field name="description">Traditionally, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) operates on a single population with no restrictions on possible mating pairs. Interesting changes to the behaviour of EAs emerge when the structure of the population is altered so that mating between individuals is restricted. Variants of EAs that use such populations are grouped into the field of spatially-structured EAs (SSEAs). 
 Previous research into the behaviour of SSEAs has primarily focused on the impact space has on the selection pressure in the system. Selection pressure is usually characterised by takeover times and the ratio between the neighbourhood size and the overall dimension of space. While this research has given indications into where and when the use of an SSEA might be suitable, it does not provide a complete coverage of system behaviour in SSEAs. This thesis presents new research into areas of SSEA behaviour that have been left either unexplored or briefly touched upon in current EA literature. 
 The behaviour of genetic drift in finite panmictic populations is well understood. This thesis attempts to characterise the behaviour of genetic drift in spatially-structured populations. First, an empirical investigation into genetic drift in two commonly encountered topologies, rings and torii, is performed. An observation is made that genetic drift in these two configurations of space is independent of the genetic structure of individuals and additive of the equivalent-sized panmictic population. In addition, localised areas of homogeneity present themselves within the structure purely as a result of drifting. A model based on the theory of random walks to absorbing boundaries is presented which accurately characterises the time to fixation through random genetic drift in ring topologies. 
 A large volume of research has gone into developing niching methods for solving multimodal problems. Previously, these techniques have used panmictic populations. This thesis introduces the concept of localised niching, where the typically global niching methods are applied to the overlapping demes of a spatially structured population. Two implementations, local sharing and local clearing are presented and are shown to be frequently faster and more robust to parameter settings, and applicable to more problems than their panmictic counterparts. 
 Current SSEAs typically use a single fitness function across the entire population. In the context of multimodal problems, this means each location in space attempts to discover all the optima. A preferable situation would be to use the inherent spatial properties of an SSEA to localise optimisation of peaks. This thesis adapts concepts from multiobjective optimisation with environmental gradients and applies them to multimodal problems. In addition to adapting to the fitness landscape, individuals evolve towards their preferred environmental conditions. This has the effect of separating individuals into regions that concentrate on different optima with the global fitness function. The thesis also gives insights into the expected number of individuals occupying each optima in the problem. 
 The SSEAs and related models developed in this thesis are of interest to both researchers and end-users of evolutionary computation. From the end-user&#65533;s perspective, the developed SSEAs require less a priori knowledge of a given problem domain in order to operate effectively, so they can be more readily applied to difficult, poorly-defined problems. Also, the theoretical findings of this thesis provides a more complete understanding of evolution within spatially-structured populations, which is of interest not only to evolutionary computation practitioners, but also to researchers in the fields of population genetics and ecology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evolutionary programming (computer science)</field><field name="subject">evolutionary computation</field><field name="subject">genetic algorithms</field><field name="subject">electronic data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080902.161336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An uncomfortable engagement : the charismatic movement in the New Zealand Anglican Church 1965-85</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Dale</field><field name="description">This thesis traces the uncomfortable relationship between a mainstream Christian denomination in New Zealand, the Anglican Church, and a movement of religious enthusiasm, the Charismatic Movement. The institutional Anglican Church&#65533;s struggle with the movement went through different stages from initial discomfort and concern, to some cautious acceptance before moving to marginalise it. This marginalisation led to the creation of Anglican Renewal Ministries New Zealand (ARMNZ), an Anglican charismatic institution within the Anglican Church. 
 The reasons for this "struggle to embrace" were that the movement originated, and was resourced from, outside the institutional New Zealand Anglican Church structures; fulfilled needs that the institutional Church in New Zealand was perceived as having failed to fulfil; introduced beliefs and practices perceived as "un-Anglican;" and competed with other initiatives within the New Zealand Anglican Church. This uncomfortable relationship contributed to the failure of the Charismatic leaders to renew spiritually the whole New Zealand Anglican Church. The movement however, helped to broaden the scope of New Zealand Anglicanism and left a legacy of some large charismatic churches. 
 This is the first substantial study of the Charismatic Movement in the New Zealand Anglican Church covering the period from the emergence of the movement in the mid-1960s, through the growth years in the 1970s marked by the formation of a national and ecumenical charismatic agency (Christian Advance Ministries), to the establishment of the Charismatic Movement as an institution within the Anglican Church in the early 1980s.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church of the Province of New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Pentecostalism</field><field name="subject">Church renewal</field><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">New Zealand history</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080904.091942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The neolithic period in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Wiriyaromp, Warrachai</field><field name="description">There are two principal models that purport to interpret the evidence for the origins of the Neolithic period in Thailand. Both stress the importance of rice cultivation and the domestication of a range of animals. One incorporates archaeological and linguistic evidence in identifying the origins as the result of the diffusion of farming communities into Southeast Asia and India from a source in the Yangtze River valley. The alternative stresses a local evolutionary pathway whereby indigenous hunter-gatherers began to cultivate rice within Thailand. 
 This dissertation is centred on the results of the excavation of Ban Non Wat, in the Upper Mun Valley of Northeast Thailand. This has provided one of the largest, best dated and provenanced samples of occupation and mortuary remains of a Neolithic community so far available in Southeast Asia. Its principal objective is to define the motifs incised, impressed and painted onto the surface of ceramic mortuary vessels, in order to permit a comparison with other assemblages first in Thailand, then in Southeast Asia north into China. It is held that if there are close parallels over a wide geographic area, in these motifs, then it would support a model of diffusion. If there are not, then the alternative of local origins would need to be examined closely. 
 It is argued that the similarity in motifs, particularly a stylised human figure, between Thai and Vietnamese sites lends support to a common origin for these groups. The motifs are not so obvious when examining the southern Chinese data, although the mode of decoration by painting, incising and impressing recur there. This, in conjunction with mortuary rituals, weaving technology, the domestic dog, and the linguistic evidence, sustains a model for demic diffusion. However, the presence of ceramic vessels also decorated with impressed/incised techniques in maritime hunter-gatherer contexts stresses that the actual Neolithic settlement may have been more complex.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neolithic period</field><field name="subject">prehistoric antiquities</field><field name="subject">human remains (Archaeology)</field><field name="subject">anthropometry</field><field name="subject">pottery</field><field name="subject">excavations (Archaeology)</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Ban Non Wat</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080904.111233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of a novel inhibitor of apoptosis expressed by Orf virus</field><field name="creator">Westphal, Dana</field><field name="description">Apoptosis plays important roles in host defences against virus infection. It is therefore not surprising that viruses have developed a vast array of modulators that block this process at different stages within the apoptotic pathways. Intrestingly, Orf virus (ORFV), a member of the Parapoxvirus genus, did not reveal any of the known poxviral inhibitors of apoptosis, but was found to express a unique anti-apoptotic protein, ORFV125. The aim of this PhD project was to determine the subcellular localisation of this protein and to further characterise its anti-apoptotic activity. This included exploring its ability to inhibit early, intermediate and late events of apoptosis and identifying the mechanism by which this viral protein functions to prevent cell death. 
 Experiments revealed that ORFV125 was localised to the mitochondria through a C-terminal mitochondrial-targeting motif, and this specific location was necessary for the protein&#65533;s anti-apoptotic function. Furthermore, the viral protein inhibited UV-induced apoptotic events at and downstream of the mitochondria such as cytochrome c release, caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. However, it was not able to prevent UV-induced activation of the c-Jun-NH&#8322; kinase (JNK), an event occurring upstream of the mitochondria, consistent with its localisation to this organelle. The ability to prevent apoptosis was comparable with that of the cellular anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which belongs to a family of mitochondrial regulators of apoptosis. 
 Although standard BLAST analysis failed to detect homology to anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, a manual alignment of the primary sequence of ORFV125 with these proteins revealed characteristic residues of Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains within ORFV125. These motifs are conserved within the Bcl-2 proteins and important for their structure and function. In addition, mutating amino acids within the ORFV125 BH domains led to a loss of the anti-apoptotic function of the mutated proteins, indicating the functional importance of these residues for the viral protein. These observations suggest that ORFV125 might be classified as a viral Bcl-2-like protein. 
 To provide evidence for this hypothesis, it was investigated if ORFV125 acts in a Bcl-2-like manner to inhibit apoptosis. The viral protein was able to entirely block the activation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bak and Bax, although it did not directly bind to these proteins. Instead, ORFV125 interacted with a subset of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, which can trigger the activation of Bax and Bak. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that ORFV125 could inhibit apoptosis induced by BH3-only proteins to which the viral protein could bind. On the other hand, ORFV125 was not able to prevent the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins that it failed to interact with. This shows that ORFV125&#65533;s mechanism of action is to inhibit the activity of BH3-only proteins by binding and neutralising their function. 
 Overall, these results provided evidence that ORFV125 is potent anti-apoptotic protein that can prevent UV-induced cell death without the participation of other ORFV proteins. Furthermore, the viral protein shared primary sequence and secondary structure similarities to Bcl-2 family members and acted in a Bcl-2-like manner to inhibit apoptosis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Orf virus</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080922.162136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive and emotional effects of vestibular damage in rats and their medial temporal lobe substrates</field><field name="creator">Goddard, Matthew John</field><field name="description">Psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment are increasingly being described in patients with vestibular pathology. Yet frameworks that describe the link between emotion, memory and the vestibular system have yet to reach maturity, partly because studies have not yet provided detailed accounts of behavioral changes in experimental animals, or in man. One of the goals of this thesis was to use experimental psychology to define changes in memory and emotional behaviour in rats given bilateral vestibular deafferentation (BVD, n=18) or sham surgery (Sham, n=17). In an elevated-plus maze task, BVD rats made up to 166% greater open arm entries and spent up to 42% more time in the open arms compared to Sham rats. In an elevated-T maze task, BVD rats failed to develop a normal learned inhibition response to open space. In an open field maze BVD rats consistently showed 50-60% greater movement velocity, spent on average 35% more time in the inner most aversive part of the arena, and failed to show the normal boundary-seeking behaviour (thigmotaxis) typical of untreated or Sham rats. In a social interaction test BVD rats spent up to 34% less time engaged in social contact compared to Sham rats. In a hyponeophagia test, BVD rats&#65533; latency to eat was 70% greater than Sham rats at 3-weeks post-op., however this difference disappeared at 3- and 5-months. These findings suggest that BVD treatment may in some cases disrupt normal behavioral inhibition. Memory performance was also affected. In a T-maze task BVD rats achieved 40-60% correct arm entries, compared to 90-100% for Sham controls. In a foraging task carried out in darkness, BVD rats&#65533; initial homing angle was random, homing paths were ~70% longer, and reference memory errors were ~56% greater compared to Sham rats. To elucidate possible neurochemical substrates for these behavioral changes, western blot assays on monoamine proteins were carried out on tissue from a nai&#776;ve set of rats (BVD n=6; Sham n=6). In BVD rats, serotonin transporter protein expression was 39% lower in CA1 hippocampus and 27% lower in the forebrain region, despite forebrain tryptophan hydroxylase expression being 34% upregulated. Tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the forebrain region was 27% lower in BVD rats. Proteins related to synaptogenesis were also investigated. In the dentate gyrus SNAP-25 was 37% upregulated in BVD rats, while in area CA2/3 of the hippocampus neurofilament-L was 13% upregulated. Forebrain and entorhinal cortex drebrin expression was 28% and 38% downregulated in BVD rats. Neurofilament-L was also 31% downregulated in the forebrain region of BVD rats. To test whether any of these behavioral or biochemical changes may have been attributable to chronic physiological stress, a corticosterone assay was carried out at the conclusion of behavioral testing; however, the no significant between treatment differences were found. In conclusion, vestibular information appears to be needed for the acquisition of spatial and reference memory as well as the normal expression of emotional behaviour. The neurochemical changes described herein point toward possible substrates for these behaviors, however their full significance has yet to be determined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vestibular apparatus</field><field name="subject">temporal lobes</field><field name="subject">pathophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080923.091605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel approaches for physicochemical characterisation and quantification of amorphous pharmaceutical compounds</field><field name="creator">Heinz, Andrea</field><field name="description">The amorphous state is becoming increasingly important in the pharmaceutical setting. Formulation of poorly water soluble drugs in the amorphous form enhances physicochemical properties of the drug, such as solubility and dissolution rate, which in turn may lead to an increased bioavailability. However, despite these advantages, many properties of the amorphous state are not yet understood and amorphous materials pose a challenge for structural analysis since they lack three dimensional long range order. Hence, compared to crystalline materials often little structural information can be gained using standard characterisation techniques. 
 In this thesis, a range of analytical techniques and data analysis tools were used to characterise as well as quantify amorphous drugs and compare them to their crystalline counterparts. Apart from established characterisation techniques such as X-ray powder diffraction, microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry, molecular-level characterisation was carried out using vibrational spectroscopies including infrared, near infrared, and Raman spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis methods. To obtain deeper understanding of the structure of amorphous drugs and their corresponding crystalline forms novel approaches such as pair distribution function analysis of X-ray diffraction data and computational chemistry were employed. 
 Three model drugs namely indomethacin, saquinavir, and fenofibrate were investigated in the scope of this thesis. For indomethacin differences between amorphous forms of indomethacin prepared by ball milling, spray drying, as well as melting and subsequent cooling were analysed using infrared, near infrared, and Raman spectroscopy in combination with principal component analysis. While all spectroscopic techniques were able to differentiate between the differently prepared samples, Raman spectroscopy proved to be most sensitive to small differences in the solid state of different samples. Consistent with the study of indomethacin, Raman spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis was the most sensitive analytical technique to detect structural changes induced by milling or heating saquinavir. In addition, pair distribution function transforms of the X-ray powder diffraction data significantly contributed to the understanding of differences in short-range and long-range order between differently treated saquinavir samples. 
 A combination of vibrational spectroscopy, quantum mechanical calculations, and multivariate analysis proved suitable for physicochemical analysis of amorphous fenofibrate. The results of the study support the idea that non hydrogen bonded molecules such as fenofibrate are likely to exhibit random molecular orientations and conformations in the amorphous phase since the weak intermolecular interactions that occur between such molecules can easily be disrupted. 
 A study of ternary mixtures of crystalline and amorphous forms of indomethacin showed that Raman and near-infrared spectroscopy in conjunction with PLS regression are well suited for quantification of the different solid-state forms simultaneously. It was found that near-infrared spectroscopy can be used to more accurately quantify the mixtures compared to Raman spectroscopy when fluorescing components, such as amorphous indomethacin, are present. Nevertheless quantification with Raman spectroscopy was still possible. 
 Overall, the analytical methods used in this thesis were successfully employed for qualitative and quantitative analysis of amorphous drugs and their crystalline counterparts. It could be shown that it is beneficial to use a combination of different analytical techniques and data analysis tools since results are complementary and allow a more comprehensive description of the solid state.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amorphous substances</field><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">solubility</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080924.133134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and their determinants in the New Zealand population</field><field name="creator">Rockell, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Adequate vitamin D status plays an important role in bone health and may also protect against Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis and certain cancers. Vitamin D is obtained from two sources; diet and through skin synthesis through the action of ultraviolet (UV) light. Dietary intakes of vitamin D are low in New Zealand (NZ) and the majority of our vitamin D comes from UV exposure. The NZ population may be at risk of low vitamin D status because of low dietary intakes, the country&#65533;s latitude (35-46 &#65533;S), and high proportion of darker skinned Maori and Pacific People. While case reports have described the occurrence of rickets, predominantly in immigrant groups, there are currently no national data on the vitamin D status of the NZ population. Reports of low vitamin D status in countries of similar latitude to NZ justify an examination of New Zealanders&#65533; vitamin D status. The best method to assess of vitamin D status is to measure circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. 
 This thesis comprises three main studies. The first two had the following aims: to measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and their determinants in a national sample (n=1585) of NZ children aged 5-14 y and to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and their determinants in a national sample (n=2948) of New Zealanders aged 15 y and over. The 2002 Children&#65533;s Nutrition Survey CNS02 was a year long (December, March-November) cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of NZ school children 5-14 y. Over-sampling of Maori and Pacific children allowed ethnic specific analyses. The 1997 National Nutrition Survey (NNS97) participants were recruited over one year according to an area-based sampling frame with a 3 stage stratified design consisting of primary sampling units, households within each unit, and one randomly selected respondent from each household. Mean (99% CI) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were similar in children and adults (both 50 nmol/L). Among Maori, Pacific and NZEO children respectively, prevalence (%, 99% CI) of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (&lt; 17.5 nmol/L) was 5% (2, 12), 8% (5, 14), and 3% (1,7). Based on a cutoff of &lt; 37.5 nmol/L, prevalence of insufficiency was 41% (29, 53), 59% (42, 75) and 25% (15, 35), respectively. Based on a cutoff of 50 nmol/L, 56% of children were insufficient. Three percent of adult New Zealanders had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations indicative of deficiency ([less than or equal to] 17.5 nmol/L); 48% and 84% were insufficient based on cutoffs of [less than or equal to] 50 and [less than or equal to] 80 nmol/L The main determinants of vitamin D status in NZ children were season, ethnicity and sex. After adjustment for other factors and covariates, boys had an adjusted mean (99% CI) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration 5 (1, 9) nmol/L higher than girls, Maori children were 7 (2, 11) and Pacific children 15 (11, 20) nmol/L lower than NZ European and Other (NZEO) children. Obese children were 7 (2, 11) nmol/L lower than overweight or &#65533;normal&#65533; weight. Children&#65533;s mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (adjusted for other variables) peaked in March (69 nmol/L) and was at its lowest in August (36 nmol/L). 
 In adults, there were effects of a similar magnitude of ethnicity and season on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Obesity, latitude and age were determinants of vitamin D status in women but not men. Obese (BMI &gt; 30) women had an adjusted mean vitamin concentration 6 (3, 10) nmol/L lower than women with BMI &lt; 25. Women living in the South Island were 6 (3, 9) nmol/L lower than women living in the North Island. Additionally, adjusted mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 13 (8, 18) higher in women 15 -18 y than women 65 y or older. 
 The third and final study aimed to determine whether the higher rates of vitamin D inadequacy reported in the winter than summer months in NZ also result in higher PTH concentrations, which would provide evidence for functional effect of inadequate vitamin D status. We also aimed to objectively explore the effect of natural skin colour on vitamin D status, given the higher prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in dark-skinned groups living far from the equator. Skin colour measurements were taken with a hand-held light reflectometer (Datacolor Mercury[TM] 1000 colorimeter, Lawrenceville, NJ). 
 In the 342 residents of Invercargill and Dunedin, mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower in the late summer versus early spring (79 vs 51 nmol/L; P&lt; 0.001). The lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in early spring versus summer was associatedwith a 2 pg/mL (P&lt; 0.001) higher parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration. Interestingly, no significant effect of natural skin colour, based on light reflectance at the inside of the upper arm, was discovered, though there was a positive effect of tanning, based on light reflectance at the upper forearm, on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. 
 Ethnicity and season are major determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in New Zealanders. There is a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in NZ children and adults, which may contribute to increased risk of osteoporosis and other chronic disease. While there is a pressing need for more convincing evidence with regards to the health risks associated with the low vitamin D status in children, evidence from the study of adults, where higher PTH concentrations were found during spring versus summer, suggests that the low 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are having an adverse effect on bone health of adults. The high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in New Zealanders, warrants serious consideration of strategies such as fortification, to improve the vitamin D status of the population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vitamin D in the body</field><field name="subject">Health aspects</field><field name="subject">New Zealand population</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080929.142611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of cold-pressed flaxseed oils and products from their enzymatic transesterification with cinnamic and ferulic acids</field><field name="creator">Choo, Wee Sim</field><field name="description">The physicochemical characteristics of seven cold-pressed flaxseed oils sold in New Zealand were investigated for their fatty acid composition, tocopherol composition, moisture and volatile matter, free fatty acids, chlorophyll pigments, unsaponifiable matter, total phenolic acids and flavanoids, and colour. The seven cold-pressed flaxseed oils exhibited significant variations in their physicochemical characteristics. Quality of the oils in terms of oxidative stability was also investigated. Four oils were found to be within the limit of good stability oil indices, measured in terms of peroxide value, p-anisidine value, conjugated dienoic acids, specific extinction in ultraviolet spectrum, acid value and food oil sensor readings (to indicate total polar compounds). 
 The role of minor constituents in the oxidative stability of two selected oils with different levels of fatty acid composition and minor constituents was investigated. Pan heating at 150&#65533;C caused loss of tocopherols, plastochromanol-8, phenolic acids, chlorophyll pigments, &#946;-carotene and lutein and changes in the fatty acid composition. The pan-heated oils exceeded the limit of good stability oil indices using the measurement mentioned above except for acid value. The addition of &#945;-tocopherol to the oils did not provide enhanced protection to the oils in accelerated aging of oil tests at 60&#65533;C. It was most likely that phenolic acids present in the oils played a dominant role in the oxidative stability of the oils. 
 Lipase-catalyzed transesterification of triolein with cinnamic and ferulic acids using a commercially available immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (Novozym 435) was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the lipophilized products as model systems for enhanced protection of unsaturated oil. The lipophilized products were identified using Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectroscopy (ESI-MS). Separation and isolation of two classes of lipophilized products was also achieved using a solid phase extraction method developed in this study for further investigation into the structure-free radical scavenging activity. Free radical scavenging activity was determined using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) method. The polarity of the solvents proved important in determining the free radical scavenging activity of the substrates. Ferulic acid showed much higher free radical scavenging activity than cinnamic acid, which had limited activity. The esterification of cinnamic acid and ferulic acid with triolein resulted in significant increase and decrease in the free radical scavenging activity, respectively. These opposite effects were due to the effect of addition of electron-donating alkyl groups on the predominant mechanism of reaction (hydrogen atom transfer or electron transfer) of a species with DPPH. The effect of esterification of cinnamic acid was confirmed using ethyl cinnamate which greatly enhances the free radical scavenging activity. Although, compared with the lipophilized cinnamic acid product, the activity was lower. The free radical scavenging activity of the main component isolated from lipophilized cinnamic acid product using solid phase extraction, monocinnamoyldioleoylglycerol, was as good as the unseparated mixture of lipophilized product. Based on the ratio of a substrate to DPPH concentration, lipophilized ferulic acid was a much more efficient free radical scavenger than lipophilized cinnamic acid. 
 Lipase-catalyzed transesterification of flaxseed oil with cinnamic and ferulic acids using Novozym 435 was conducted to evaluate whether the lipophilized products provided enhanced antioxidant activity in the oil. The lipophilized products were identified using ESI-MS and were examined for their free radical scavenging activity toward DPPH in ethanol and ethyl acetate. Ferulic acid showed the highest free radical scavenging activity among all substrates tested while cinnamic acid had negligible activity. The effect of esterification of cinnamic acid and ferulic acid with flaxseed oil was similar to that with triolein. Lipophilized ferulic acid was a better free radical scavenger as compared with lipophilized cinnamic acid and extended the naturally-occuring antioxidant capacity of the flaxseed oil. Lipophilized cinnamic acid did not provide much enhanced radical scavenging activity in the flaxseed oil as the presence of natural hydrophilic antioxidants in the oil had much greater radical scavenging activity. It may still be useful for unsaturated oils with a small amount of natural antioxidants in them. Lipophilized cinnamic and ferulic acids showed higher free radical scavenging activity when tested in a less polar solvent (ethyl acetate) whereas ferulic acid showed better activity in a more polar solvent (ethanol). 
 These results indicate that the choice of solvent for the DPPH assay is critical in evaluating the free radical scavenging activity of substrates of differing polarity, and support previous observations by other authors that the solubility of an antioxidant in relation to the site of oxidation is an important factor for consideration in the use of antioxidants.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">linseed oil</field><field name="subject">transesterification</field><field name="subject">organic acids</field><field name="subject">fatty acids</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080930.144440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The acute effects of lithium on the rat kidney</field><field name="creator">Jing, Yu</field><field name="description">The aim of the experiments reported in the present work was: first, to generate a rat model of lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), and, second, to use this to test the hypothesis that the effects of lithium were far more reaching than merely the inhibition of vasopressin induced translocation and synthesis of the water channel protein AQP2. Specifically, the effect of lithium on the abundance and distribution of the other water channel proteins, AQP1, AQP3 and AQP4 was investigated. It was found that AQP3 protein abundance was significantly reduced in the renal medulla while AQP4 was not affected. In addition, it was further hypothesized that, given the known effects of lithium on the urea transporter UT-A1 and on sodium channels and transporters, the renal medullary osmotic gradient would be dissipated by lithium. This was examined indirectly by determining the amounts of organic osmolytes in the renal medulla of rats with lithium-induced NDI. Myo-inositol was found to be 85 &#65533; 9 mmol kg&#8315;1 protein in the NDI rats, a reduction of 38% compared with control values, sotbitol fell from 35&#65533; 9 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; in the control rats to 2.5 &#65533; 0.5 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533;, and glycerophosphorylcholine levels in the experimental animals were 91 &#65533; 18 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; protein compared with 372 &#65533; 72 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; in the controls. In addition, betaine decreased to 38 &#65533; 2 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; protein from 69 &#65533; 10 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; protein in the control. The urea content of the medulla was found to have fallen from 2868 &#65533; 558 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; protein to 480 &#65533; 105 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; protein. These data indicated that indeed the medullary osmotic gradient, the driving force for AVP-dependent fluid reabsorption in the kidney was greatly reduced during lithium-induced NDI. 
 Thirdly, it was proposed that the sodium-channel blocker, amiloride, by acting to prevent lithium entry into the cells of the collecting duct, should ameliorate or abolish the adverse effects of lithium on the kidney. Treatment of rats with established NDI, with amiloride, reversed to a large extent the reduction in aquaporin protein expression and re-established the medullary osmotic gradient, as assessed by the ability of treated rats to concentrate their urine, and by the rise in amounts of medullary osmolytes. Administration of 0.5 mmol l&#8315;&#65533; amiloride to lithium-treated rats led to medullary AQP2 and AQP3 protein abundance increasing by 82% &#65533; 16% and 110% &#65533; 4% of the control level respectively. The content of urea in the medulla also increased to 2474 &#65533; 557 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; protein. 
 Finally, since in humans it is known that the chronic effect of lithium on the kidney is to cause cortical fibrosis and renal failure, microarray studies were commenced to look for evidence of early changes in gene activity in response to lithium-administration. The results showed that 77 genes were either up- or down-regulated, in particular, genes that are involved in the apoptosis pathway. 
 In the light of these results it is plausible to suggest that the acute renal effects of lithium to induce NDI can be effectively mitigated, and reversed, by administration of amiloride. Whether this can serve to offset the chronic effects of lithium on the kidney awaits further investigation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kidneys</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">lithium</field><field name="subject">physiological effect</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080930.145652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tectonic evolution of the Eastern Fiordland Gondwana margin</field><field name="creator">Scott, James Morfey</field><field name="description">Eastern Fiordland is an eroded Carboniferous to Cretaceous arc assemblage juxtaposed against the Western Fiordland Gondwana continental margin along the Grebe Shear Zone. In the Manapouri region, Eastern Fiordland is composed of scattered metasedimentary and plutonic rocks of Carboniferous, Jurassic and Jurassic-Early Cretaceous age. Quantitative P-T estimates on rare paragneiss assemblages, coupled with LA-ICP-MS analyses of metamorphic overgrowths on detrital zircon grains, demonstrate metamorphism at low to middle amphibolite facies (&lt;6 kbar, c. 600&#65533;C) at 145.0 &#65533; 2.8 Ma (all quoted errors at 2[sigma]). The Manapouri-Lake Te Anau area of Eastern Fiordland also exposes scattered fragments of the Mesozoic volcano-sedimentary Loch Burn Formation. Relict sedimentary features within this long-lived Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous unit indicate deposition in a mostly terrestrial or shallow water environment that was fed by debris flows from proximal granitic and volcanic topographic high points. Deposition of the Loch Burn Formation in the Murchison Mountains is bracketed between a 342.3 &#65533; 1.5 Ma basal granite and an intrusive 157.6 &#65533; 1.4 Ma quartz diorite. Metamorphism throughout the unit achieved greenschist and amphibolite facies temperatures (P unconstrained) in the Early Cretaceous (post c. 148 Ma and prior to c. 121 Ma). 
 Although metasedimentary rocks provide insights into the tectonic evolution of Eastern Fiordland, a range of compositionally heterogeneous plutonic rocks dominates the geology. At Lake Manapouri, these comprise four principal associations: (1) the composite Pomona Island Granite (Carboniferous-Permian and Jurassic), (2) the Beehive Diorite (148.6 &#65533; 2.3 Ma), (3) the heterogeneous Hunter Intrusives (Carboniferous, Jurassic and Early Cretaceous) of the Darran/Median Suite and (4) HiSY granitoid dikes of the Separation Point Suite (123.5 &#65533; l.2Ma). The latter suite also occurs in immediately adjacent parts of Western Fiordland, forming the Refrigerator Orthogneiss (120.7 &#65533;1.1 Ma), the Puteketeke Granite (120.9 &#65533; 0.8 Ma) and the West Arm Leucogranite (116.3 &#65533; 1.2 Ma). Geobarometry indicates the Jurassic portions of the Darran/Median Suite were emplaced between 4 - 6 kbar and Western Fiordland Early Cretaceous Separation Point Suite between 5 - 7 kbar. Zircon initial &#65533;&#8311;&#8311;Hf/&#65533;&#8311;&#8310;Hf isotopic ratios suggest that Separation Point Suite magma could be derived from the same Paleozoic - Late Neoproterozoic mantle source as the Jurassic portion of the Hunter Intrusives member of the Darran/Median Suite. However, Early Cretaceous plutons west of the Early Cretaceous active margin (and study area) have significantly more evolved source regions, reflecting the influence of continental Gondwana on lithosphere composition. Initial &#65533;&#8311;&#8311;Hf/&#65533;&#8311;&#8310;Hf ratios from the Loch Burn Formation Carboniferous basal granite zircon are slightly less primitive than either Darran/Median or Separation Point Suite but nowhere near as evolved as similar-aged zircon in the Eastern Fiordland Mt Crescent Paragneiss unit in the Hunter Mountains. 
 The Cambrian/Early Ordovician Russet Paragneiss, which lies just west of the Grebe Mylonite Zone in Western Fiordland and has been intruded by a range of Early Paleozoic to Mesozoic plutons, was metamorphosed at 7.5 &#65533; 1.2 kbar, 633 &#65533; 25&#65533;C at 348.6 &#65533; 12 Ma and exhibits no evidence for Jurassic re-equilibration. Zircon U-Pb isotopes from a pelitic schist enclave within the Western Fiordland Mt Murrell Amphibolite are interpreted to show that these and associated intrusive rocks were also metamorphosed at kyanite-grade in the Carboniferous. This event, &#65533;M1&#65533;, generated a pervasive lineation and distinctive pargasite-anorthite-kyanite/corundum-bearing assemblages in layered aluminous components to the Mt Murrell Amphibolite, garnet-amphibole-biotite-kyanite-gedrite-plagioclase-quartz in metasomatised tonalite at the Mt Murrell Amphibolite margins, and low CaO-garnet in pelitic schist enclaves within the amphibolite. P-T estimates suggest M1 took place at 6.6 &#65533; 0.8 kbar, 618 &#65533; 25&#65533;C. Both the timing and P-T conditions of M1 overlap with metamorphism of the Russet Paragneiss. However, the layered amphibolites and pelitic schist enclaves partially re-equilibrated in the Early Cretaceous (c. 115 Ma) at higher pressure (8.8 &#65533; 0.9 kbar). This event, &#65533;M2&#65533;, generated static assemblages of margarite, epidote, chlorite, oligoclase-andesine and second-generation kyanite in the layered amphibolites and relict olivine gabbronorite, and high-CaO garnet rims, biotite, plagioclase, quartz, kyanite and staurolite in the pelitic schist enclaves. Trace element chemistries of c. 340 Ma zircon grains in the schist have unusual smoothed Ce/Ce* anomalies and high Th/U ratios. These properties may be result of fluid flow and metasomatism from the enveloping amphibolite during imposition of the penetrative M1 lineation. Early Cretaceous (c. 115 Ma) zircon overgrowths and chemistries (low heavy rare earth elements, low Th/U ratios, large Eu/Eu* anomalies) are compatible with formation in the presence of local M2 garnet and plagioclase. M2 was coeval with amphibolite to garnet-granulite facies metamorphism of the regionally extensive Western Fiordland Orthogneiss and Arthur River Complex, thus demonstrating that high-pressure metamorphism was not restricted to the Western Fiordland Early Cretaceous components and their marginal metasedimentary rocks. 
 The Grebe Mylonite Zone forms a lithologic, metamorphic, isotopic and structural boundary between Eastern and Western Fiordland. This 200 to 300 metre-wide and &gt; 50 km long north-striking mylonitic zone is the prominent manifestation of deformation associated with the wider (c. 30 km) Grebe Shear Zone, which extends into Eastern and Western Fiordland. Qualitative and quantitative P-T estimates indicate the currently exposed level of the Grebe Mylonite Zone was active at amphibolite facies conditions (c. 600&#65533;C and c. 6 kbar). Coupled U-Pb and Ar-Ar data indicate the mylonite zone was active at, or between, c. 128 and 116 Ma. Temperature-time profiles constructed along a transect perpendicular to the shear zone, used in conjunction with fabric data and the orientation of nearby Tertiary unconformities, suggest that the currently sub-vertical shear zone was rotated during the Cenozoic from an initially steeply east-dipping geometry with a reverse sense of shear. This style of deformation is consistent with an inclined continuously partitioned transpressional structure. Synkinematic emplacement and deformation of the Refrigerator Orthogneiss implies that Grebe Shear Zone provided a crustal anisotropy that facilitated the movement and emplacement of some Separation Point Suite magmas through the crust. 
 Data collected here are interpreted to show that the Grebe Shear Zone is a terrane-bounding suture. Differences in metasedimentary rock composition, age, provenance and metamorphism across the zone suggest that the crustal framework to Eastern Fiordland did not forth in its current tectonic position. Instead, the Mesozoic portion of Eastern Fiordland is inferred to have developed allochthonously with respect to Western Fiordland, with components internally dismembered and rearranged during Jurassic metamorphism and juxtaposition in the Early Cretaceous. However, the Jurassic portion of the arc may have developed near the Gondwana margin because the Jurassic Borland Paragneiss contains detritus that can be partly matched to sources in the Western and Eastern Provinces of New Zealand, as well as early parts of the Darran/Median Suite and Loch Burn Formation. Recognition that the Eastern Fiordland arc was faulted against and then over Western Fiordland in the Early Cretaceous provides a possible driving mechanism for coeval transpressive shortening, rapid burial and high-pressure metamorphism (e.g., as seen in the Mt Murrell Amphibolite) of the lower Western Fiordland crust.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">morphotectonics</field><field name="subject">Fiordland</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081003.094325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perspectives on belief and change</field><field name="creator">Aucher, Guillaume</field><field name="description">This thesis is about logical models of belief (and knowledge) representation and belief change. This means that we propose logical systems which are intended to represent how agents perceive a situation and reason about it, and how they update their beliefs about this situation when events occur. These agents can be machines, robots, human beings. . . but they are assumed to be somehow autonomous. 
 The way a fixed situation is perceived by agents can be represented by statements about the agents&#65533; beliefs: for example &#65533;agent A believes that the door of the room is open&#65533; or &#65533;agent A believes that her colleague is busy this afternoon&#65533;. &#65533;Logical systems&#65533; means that agents can reason about the situation and their beliefs about it: if agent A believes that her colleague is busy this afternoon then agent A infers that he will not visit her this afternoon. We moreover often assume that our situations involve several agents which interact between each other. So these agents have beliefs about the situation (such as &#65533;the door is open&#65533;) but also about the other agents&#65533; beliefs: for example agent A might believe that agent B believes that the door is open. These kinds of beliefs are called higher-order beliefs. Epistemic logic [Hintikka, 1962; Fagin et al., 1995; Meyer and van der Hoek, 1995], the logic of belief and knowledge, can capture all these phenomena and will be our main starting point to model such fixed (&#65533;static&#65533;) situations. Uncertainty can of course be expressed by beliefs and knowledge: for example agent A being uncertain whether her colleague is busy this afternoon can be expressed by &#65533;agent A does not know whether her colleague is busy this afternoon&#65533;. But we sometimes need to enrich and refine the representation of uncertainty: for example, even if agent A does not know whether her colleague is busy this afternoon, she might consider it more probable that he is actually busy. So other logics have been developed to deal more adequately with the representation of uncertainty, such as probabilistic logic, fuzzy logic or possibilistic logic, and we will refer to some of them in this thesis (see [Halpern, 2003] for a survey on reasoning about uncertainty). 
 But things become more complex when we introduce events and change in the picture. Issues arise even if we assume that there is a single agent. Indeed, if the incoming information conveyed by the event is coherent with the agent&#65533;s beliefs then the agent can just add it to her beliefs. But if the incoming information contradicts the agent&#65533;s beliefs then the agent has somehow to revise her beliefs, and as it turns out there is no obvious way to decide what should be her resulting beliefs. Solving this problem was the goal of the logic-based belief revision theory developed by Alchourro&#769;n, Ga&#776;rdenfors and Makinson (to which we will refer by the term AGM) [Alchourro&#769;n et al., 1985; Ga&#776;rdenfors, 1988; Ga&#776;rdenfors and Rott, 1995]. Their idea is to introduce &#65533;rationality postulates&#65533; that specify which belief revision operations can be considered as being &#65533;rational&#65533; or reasonable, and then to propose specific revision operations that fulfill these postulates. However, AGM does not consider situations where the agent might also have some uncertainty about the incoming information: for example agent A might be uncertain due to some noise whether her colleague told her that he would visit her on Tuesday or on Thursday. In this thesis we also investigate this kind of phenomenon. Things are even more complex in a multi-agent setting because the way agents update their beliefs depends not only on their beliefs about the event itself but also on their beliefs about the way the other agents perceived the event (and so about the other agents&#65533; beliefs about the event). For example, during a private announcement of a piece of information to agent A the beliefs of the other agents actually do not change because they believe nothing is actually happening; but during a public announcement all the agents&#65533; beliefs might change because they all believe that an announcement has been made. Such kind of subtleties have been dealt with in a field called dynamic epistemic logic (Gerbrandy and Groeneveld, 1997; Baltag et al., 1998; van Ditmarsch et al., 2007b]. The idea is to represent by an event model how the event is perceived by the agents and then to define a formal update mechanism that specifies how the agents update their beliefs according to this event model and their previous representaton of the situation. Finally, the issues concerning belief revision that we raised in the single agent case are still present in the multi-agent case. 
 So this thesis is more generally about information and information change. However, we will not deal with problems of how to store information in machines or how to actually communicate information. Such problems have been dealt with in information theory [Cover and Thomas, 1991] and Kolmogorov complexity theory [Li and Vita&#769;nyi, 1993]. We will just assume that such mechanisms are already available and start our investigations from there. 
 Studying and proposing logical models for belief change and belief representation has applications in several areas. First in artificial intelligence, where machines or robots need to have a formal representation of the surrounding world (which might involve other agents), and formal mechanisms to update this representation when they receive incoming information. Such formalisms are crucial if we want to design autonomous agents, able to act autonomously in the real world or in a virtual world (such as on the internet). Indeed, the representation of the surrounding world is essential for a robot in order to reason about the world, plan actions in order to achieve goals... and it must be able to update and revise its representation of the world itself in order to cope autonomously with unexpected events. Second in game theory (and consequently in economics), where we need to model games involving several agents (players) having beliefs about the game and about the other agents&#65533; beliefs (such as agent A believes that agent B has the ace of spade, or agent A believes that agent B believes that agent A has the ace of heart...), and how they update their representation of the game when events (such as showing privately a card or putting a card on the table) occur. Third in cognitive psychology, where we need to model as accurately as possible epistemic state of human agents and the dynamics of belief and knowledge in order to explain and describe cognitive processes. 
 The thesis is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, we first recall epistemic logic. Then we observe that representing an epistemic situation involving several agents depends very much on the modeling point of view one takes. For example, in a poker game the representation of the game will be different depending on whether the modeler is a poker player playing in the game or the card dealer who knows exactly what the players&#65533; cards are. In this thesis, we will carefully distinguish these different modeling approaches and the. different kinds of formalisms they give rise to. In fact, the interpretation of a formalism relies quite a lot on the nature of these modeling points of view. Classically, in epistemic logic, the models built are supposed to be correct and represent the situation from an external and objective point of view. We call this modeling approach the perfect external approach. In Chapter 2, we study the modeling point of view of a particular modeler-agent involved in the situation with other agents (and so having a possibly erroneous perception of the situation). We call this modeling approach the internal approach. We propose a logical formalism based on epistemic logic that this agent uses to represent &#65533;for herself&#65533; the surrounding world. We then set some formal connections between the internal approach and the (perfect) external approach. Finally we axiomatize our logical formalism and show that the resulting logic is decidable. 
 In Chapter 3, we first recall dynamic epistemic logic as viewed by Baltag, Moss and Solecki (to which we will refer by the term BMS). Then we study in which case seriality of the accessibility relations of epistemic models is preserved during an update, first for the full updated model and then for generated submodels of the full updated model. Finally, observing that the BMS formalism follows the (perfect) external approach, we propose an internal version of it, just as we proposed an internal version of epistemic logic in Chapter 2. 
 In Chapter 4, we still follow the internal approach and study the particular case where the event is a private announcement. We first show, thanks to our study in Chapter 3, that in a multi-agent setting, expanding in the AGM style corresponds to performing a private announcement in the BMS style. This indicates that generalizing AGM belief revision theory to a multi-agent setting amounts to study private announcement. We then generalize the AGM representation theorems to the multi-agent case. Afterwards, in the spirit of the AGM approach, we go beyond the AGM postulates and investigate multi-agent rationality postulates specific to our multi-agent setting inspired from the fact that the kind of phenomenon we study is private announcement. Finally we provide an example of revision operation that we apply to a concrete example. 
 In Chapter 5, we follow the (perfect) external approach and enrich the BMS formalism with probabilities. This enables us to provide a fined-grained account of how human agents interpret events involving uncertainty and how they revise their beliefs. Afterwards, we review different principles for the notion of knowledge that have been proposed in the literature and show how some principles that we argue to be reasonable ones can all be captured in our rich and expressive formalism. Finally, we extend our general formalism to a multi-agent setting. 
 In Chapter 6, we still follow the (perfect) external approach and enrich our dynamic epistemic language with converse events. This language is interpreted on structures with accessibility relations for both beliefs and events, unlike the BMS formalism where events and beliefs are not on the same formal level. Then we propose principles relating events and beliefs and provide a complete characterization, which yields a new logic EDL. Finally, we show that BMS can be translated into our new logic EDL thanks to the converse operator: this device enables us to translate the structure of the event model directly within a particular axiomatization of EDL, without having to refer to a particular event model in the language (as done in BMS). 
 In Chapter 7 we summarize our results and give an overview of remaining technical issues and some desiderata for future directions of research.

The focus of this thesis is an examination of phytoplankton distribution and abundance in relation to tuna fish farms in Boston Bay and near-shore Spencer Gulf. This is the first study in South Australia to define the short-term biomass fluctuations of chlorophyll and in vivo fluorescence, identify phytoplankton species distribution and abundance, including two potentially toxic dinoflagellates, and describe patch distribution relative to tuna fish farms in Boston Bay and the near-shore waters of Spencer Gulf. An ecological interpretation of phytoplankton distribution and abundance is determined and shows that community composition was different in lower Spencer Gulf compared to Boston Bay and upper Spencer Gulf sites. Pico- and nanophytoplankton were often the most abundant organisms. Diatoms and gymnoids were most common. Season and currents predominantly influenced the distribution of phytoplankton in Boston Bay and Spencer Gulf. Individual species may be influenced by inputs from the fish farms. 

Chlorophyll levels were different between the Spencer Gulf and Boston Bay sites and no differences were recorded, using mean levels of chlorophyll, between tuna cages and controls. Chlorophyll levels were higher east of Boston Island in autumn of 1999. Chlorophyll levels appeared to show a slight increase between years. This may have been an anomalous natural variation and future research may investigate this in the long term. In addition, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to investigate differences between treatments and the functional grouping model supported an ecological interpretation of the factors from the PCA. A total of 131 taxa of phytoplankton were identified in this study. The 14 dominant taxa were used in the PCA and of these, 9 were diatoms. Phytoplankton abundance was not different between tuna cages and controls. However, when examining individual species, Karenia mikimotoi was more prevalent at tuna cages, close to shore, east and west of Boston Island than at other sites. PCA showed how different species bloomed together and were seasonal. Karenia brevis and K. mikimotoi featured predominantly in the PCA with K. brevis the dominant organism during summer and autumn along with Gyrodinium spp. and smaller gymnoids. K. brevis blooms were most likely influenced by water temperatures and fixation of nitrogen from a Trichodesmium erythaeum bloom. K. mikimotoi bloomed bimodally and may be influenced by ammonia excreted from fish from the tuna farms but , on the other hand, may be limited by the high salinities of South Australian waters. Currents in the region distribute both organisms.

The final aspect of this study assessed finer temporal and spatial sampling using directional transects around tuna cages and controls using in-vivo fluorescence and size fractionated chlorophyll. The chlorophyll a sampling showed little spatial variability within a site in the 1000 m2 that the sampling area covers but far greater temporal variability (days). In contrast, fluorescence `mapping' expands the window of variability both spatially (within a site) and temporally (along transects and between days). This has given a spatial definition, which is unavailable from a single point sample, and thereby leaves room for much greater interpretation. Small patches are evident from the fluorescence mapping where this is impossible to detect from the single point samples. Therefore, the fluorescence `mapping' and patch definition show that the trend is widespread (spatially) and quite persistent (temporally) around the fish farm area. 

Size fractionated chlorophyll samples provided further insight into phytoplankton dynamics in this study where diatoms were favored over dinoflagellates and were responsible for the larger fraction of chlorophyll found at the tuna cage one (TC1) site. We suggest that seasonal fluctuations, high nutrient input from the farm activities and turbulence may be responsible for the different chlorophyll/fluorescent structures found at TC1. Future research may look at the long-term regional impact on phytoplankton size structure, biomass and communities from fish farm activities.

ELECTRACY AS REGIONAL EPISTEMOLOGY</field><field name="creator">Maybury, Terrence Shaun</field><field name="description">Arising out of the work of Marshall McLuhan, Eric Havelock, Walter Ong, Jacques Derrida and Gregory Ulmer, among others, it is widely thought there are three stages in the history of human communication: the oral, the literate and the electronic.  Nonetheless, debate is ongoing over the integration, ordering and the substantive separation of these stages.  An upshot of these debates is that each stage is loosely allied to a particular socio/political structure: hunter/gatherer or tribal societies, nation states, and globalisation respectively.  In the current alloying of &#145;electronic communication&#146; and &#145;globalisation&#146; though there is a rising interest in what is termed &#145;new regionalism&#146;, or regionalisation, even regionality.


Accordingly, Chora-Logic: Electracy as Regional Epistemology examines the possibility of an emerging conceptual alliance (and through reference to two Australian regions a sometimes embodied and situated one) between the embryonic communicational infrastructure of electracy and the age-old spatial scale of the region, a relationship that might just come to represent a means of rethinking the civic and the psychic, the commercial and governmental frameworks of an electro-energised global skein.  It may also be a way of reinvigorating a study in the relation of the body (in its capacity as a citizen-subject) to the nation state, especially as all these entities are increasingly though ambiguously constituted in and through globalisation.


The method of synthesising and antagonising these relations between electracy and regionalism is through the philosophy of chora, Plato&#146;s conception of embodied place as found in the middle section of the Timaeus, coaxed along by a range of interpretations of this important genesis myth in Western philosophy.  In particular, chora is taken up in the work of Gregory Ulmer as a key method in the ongoing conceptualisation of an electrate epistemology.  Arising out of these concerns Chora-Logic is an experimental re-configuration of the sovereign, abstracted and disembodied citizen-subject of the Cartesian mould (a significant psycho-political mooring of the literate national character) to one situated both in the virtual density and multidimensional actuality of a particular place (organically conceived of herein as an idiosyncratic mix of psychic, domestic, workplace, local and regional proximities), but whose both [dis][embodied] self-knowledge and world-knowledge are now increasingly realised by access to an electronically arbitrated global/regional polis.  In sound-bite terms, the bumper sticker could just as easily proclaim the following inversion: &#145;Think and feel chora-logically, act globally&#146;.


Finally, the nucleus of Chora-Logic: Electracy as Regional Epistemology is a risky praxis whose experimental eddy (in both formal and content terms) spins within the current ambivalence, uncertainty and fast-paced change in electronic communicative arrangements (electracy), as these are themselves wrapped in the psychic and socio-political variabilities of spatial affiliation, all of which are symbiotically entwined regardless of the historical period and/or the geographical context.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chora</field><field name="subject">electracy</field><field name="subject">epistemology</field><field name="subject">regionalism</field><field name="subject">regionality</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20081022.150147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making sense of Computer Supported Cooperative Work: A taxonomy of terminology</field><field name="creator">Ward, Sylvia Ann</field><field name="description">There are four contributions of this research: 1) confirmation of inconsistent use of
terminology in the Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) research field;
2) the development of a hierarchical terminology technique that extends the idea of
cognitive mapping into a hierarchy of concepts and dictionary of related definitions;
3) a taxonomy of terminology showing the boundary of the CSCW research field;
and 4) a dictionary of definitions relating to the terminology in the taxonomy.
The investigation of prior research in this field found that there was a proliferation of
terms all relating to support of groups, and there was a proliferation of software and
systems that support groups. However, the terminology and definitions used by
researchers were found to be inconsistent, with some terms being defined differently,
but then used interchangeably. Inconsistency makes it difficult to determine what
technology is being used in the research and where a research study fits into the
research field.
Knowledge of any research field is mainly gained through reading published research
documents. This research analysed published documents in Computer Supported
Cooperative Work (CSCW) to determine the scope, structure and meaning of the
terminology used in this research field. The research resulted in a hierarchy of
terminology and a dictionary of definitions. Future research will determine the value
of these structures for new researchers, experienced researchers, and practitioners.
During the investigation of prior research no technique was identified to undertake
such a study. A hierarchical terminology technique (HTT), which is a form of
content analysis process, was developed to structure a hierarchy of concepts to
expose the relationships between terms. This technique includes terminology
identification, analysis and presentation to show the scope of a research field and to
present terminology and definitions to improve consistency. This technique can be
used in other fields of study.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Supported Cooperative Work</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="subject">terminology</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20081005.155331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BIODIVERSITY OF THE PARASITE FAUNA OF THE
RODENT GENERA ZYZOMYS THOMAS, 1909 AND
PSEUDOMYS GRAY, 1832 FROM NORTHERN
AUSTRALIA.</field><field name="creator">Weaver, Haylee Jade</field><field name="description">This study of the parasite fauna of five Australian rodents (Muridae:
Hydromyinae: Conilurini) was undertaken to increase the knowledge of
Australian parasite biodiversity.
Trapping for Zyzomys argurus (Thomas, 1889), Pseudomys delicatulus (Gould,
1842), P. desertor Troughton, 1932, P. gracilicaudatus (Gould, 1845) and P.
hermannsburgensis (Waite, 1896) (Rodentia: Muridae) was carried out at 16
locations in Queensland between 2004 to 2006. A total of 51 rats were captured
and examined for parasites. In addition, 119 rats, from collections in the
Queensland Museum and the University of Sydney, were examined. Finally, 57
samples of parasites collected from the above hosts and deposited at the
Australian National Wildlife Collection (CSIRO) were identified.
From these five rodent species, 15 species of ectoparasites and 17 species of
endoparasites were recorded. Fifteen new host records and 14 new locality
records were found. The ectoparasites comprised four species of Laelaps Koch,
1836 (Parasitiformes: Laelapidae), four species of chiggers (Acariformes:
Trombiculidae), two species of fleas (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae, Pygiospyllidae)
and two species of ticks (Parasitiformes: Ixodidae). Three new species of lice
(Anoplura: Hoplopleuridae) were discovered.
The 17 endoparasites, all helminths, comprised fourteen species of nematode and
three species of cestode. There were 11 species of oxyurids (Nematoda:
Oxyuridae, Heteroxynematidae), including 10 new species of Syphacia, two
species of Odilia (Nematoda: Heligmonellidae), and one species of
Nippostrongylus (Nematoda: Heligmonellidae). Three species of cestodes
(Cestoda: Anoplocephalidae, Taeniidae, Davaineidae) were collected. There
were no trematodes or acanthocephalans found in any of the rodents examined.
No protistan parasites were found in tissue and blood samples taken from the
rodents.

The mean species diversity of parasites for each host rodent species was
consistently low, with values of Simpson&#146;s Reciprocal Index ranging from 1.00 &#150;
1.53. Possible factors contributing to this low diversity include habitat
preferences, dietary ecology and social structure. There was no significant
relationship found between host body weight and abundance of ectoparasites, or
host body weight and species richness of helminths. The index of discrepancy
(D) was used to evaluate the distribution of parasite species across host
populations. Most parasites were found to have aggregated distributions within
the host populations. The exception to this was two of the four species of laelapid
mite, with values &amp;lt5, indicating that they were common across host populations.
The phylogenetic relationships of the Syphacia species occurring in the
Australian bioregion were investigated using morphological characters.
Relatively low resolution of the trees produced indicated that there may be a high
degree of similarity between species. Two main clades were identified- a clade of
genera of Syphaciini from Borneo was shown to be basal to the clade of species
of Syphacia examined. Within the clade of the genus Syphacia, the new species
identified in this study formed a single cluster on trees. There was no evidence,
however, for strict coevolution of these worms and their hosts.
Overall, the research presented here adds considerable knowledge to the previous
paucity of information of the parasites of Australian native rodent species. This
was achieved by contributing new host records, locality records and identifying
and describing several new species. The relationships between conilurin rodents
and their parasites suggests that coevolution plays a large part in the speciation of
parasites, and that minimal host switching has occurred in the helminths of the
conilurins of northern Australia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parasitology</field><field name="subject">systematics</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">rodents</field><field name="identifier">http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au./thesis/adt-QCQU/public/adt-QCQU20081005.153246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Faith, race and strategy:  Japanese-Mongolian relations, 1873-1945</field><field name="creator">J.Boyd@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Between 1873 and 1945 Japan and Mongolia had a complex and important relationship that has been largely overlooked in post-war studies of Japan&#146;s imperial era.  In fact, Japanese-Mongolian relations in the modern period provide a rich field of enquiry into the nature of Japanese imperialism as well as further evidence of the complexity of Japan&#146;s relationships with other Asian countries in the decades before 1945.  This thesis examines the relationship from the Japanese perspective, drawing on a diverse range of contemporary materials, both official and unofficial, including military documents, government reports, travel guides and academic works, many of which have been neglected in earlier studies.  In previous analyses, the strategic dimension has been seen as overwhelming and Mongolia has often been regarded as merely a minor addendum to Japan&#146;s relationship with Manchuria.  In fact, however, Japan&#146;s connection with Mongolia itself was a crucial part of its interaction with the Chinese continent from the 1870s to 1945.  Though undeniably coveted for strategic reasons, Mongolia also offered unparalleled opportunities for the elaboration of all the major aspects of the discourses that made up Japan&#146;s evolving claim to solidarity with and leadership of Asia.  It also functioned as a showcase for Japan&#146;s supposedly benevolent intentions towards Asia.  In some ways, moreover, the relationship with Mongolia was presented as distinctive, particularly because of the common faith in Buddhism and a supposedly shared ancestry in ethnic terms.  In turn, the military, political, ideological and cultural opportunities apparently provided by Mongolia account for the wide range of groups and individuals in Japan that developed Mongolian connections and for the often close relations between these groups and individuals on the one hand, and the most powerful institutions of the Japanese state on the other.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">Mongolia</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Russia</field><field name="subject">strategic</field><field name="subject">Buddhism</field><field name="subject">romance</field><field name="subject">Zenrin kyokai</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081015.132836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework and evaluation of conversation agents</field><field name="creator">os.goh@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This project details the development of a novel and practical framework for the development of conversation agents (CAs), or conversation robots. CAs, are software programs which can be used to provide a natural interface between human and computers. In this study, &#145;conversation&#146; refers to real-time dialogue exchange between human and machine which may range from web chatting to &#147;on-the-go&#148; conversation through mobile devices. In essence, the project proposes a &#147;smart and effective&#148; communication technology where an autonomous agent is able to carry out simulated human conversation via multiple channels. The CA developed in this project is termed &#147;Artificial Intelligence Natural-language Identity&#148; (AINI) and AINI is used to illustrate the implementation and testing carried out in this project. Up to now, most CAs have been developed with a short term objective to serve as tools to convince users that they are talking with real humans as in the case of the Turing Test. The traditional designs have mainly relied on ad-hoc approach and hand-crafted domain knowledge. Such approaches make it difficult for a fully integrated system to be developed and modified for other domain applications and tasks. The proposed framework in this thesis addresses such limitations. Overcoming the weaknesses of previous systems have been the key challenges in this study. The research in this study has provided a better understanding of the system requirements and the development of a systematic approach for the construction of intelligent CAs based on agent architecture using a modular N-tiered approach. This study demonstrates an effective implementation and exploration of the new paradigm of Computer Mediated Conversation (CMC) through CAs. The most significant aspect of the proposed framework is its ability to re-use and encapsulate expertise such as domain knowledge, natural language query and human-computer interface through plug-in components. As a result, the developer does not need to change the framework implementation for different applications. This proposed system provides interoperability among heterogeneous systems and it has the flexibility to be adapted for other languages, interface designs and domain applications. A modular design of knowledge representation facilitates the creation of the CA knowledge bases. This enables easier integration of open-domain and domain-specific knowledge with the ability to provide answers for broader queries. In order to build the knowledge base for the CAs, this study has also proposed a mechanism to gather information from commonsense collaborative knowledge and online web documents. The proposed Automated Knowledge Extraction Agent (AKEA) has been used for the extraction of unstructured knowledge from the Web. On the other hand, it is also realised that it is important to establish the trustworthiness of the sources of information. This thesis introduces a Web Knowledge Trust Model (WKTM) to establish the trustworthiness of the sources.

In order to assess the proposed framework, relevant tools and application modules have been developed and an evaluation of their effectiveness has been carried out to validate the performance and accuracy of the system. Both laboratory and public experiments with online users in real-time have been carried out. The results have shown that the proposed system is effective. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the CA could be implemented on the Web, mobile services and Instant Messaging (IM). In the real-time human-machine conversation experiment, it was shown that AINI is able to carry out conversations with human users by providing spontaneous interaction in an unconstrained setting. The study observed that AINI and humans share common properties in linguistic features and paralinguistic cues. These human-computer interactions have been analysed and contributed to the understanding of how the users interact with CAs. Such knowledge is also useful for the development of conversation systems utilising the commonalities found in these interactions. While AINI is found having difficulties in responding to some forms of paralinguistic cues, this could lead to research directions for further work to improve the CA performance in the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conversation Agent</field><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Natural Language Processing</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081020.134601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inland Saline Aquaculture: Overcoming Biological and Technical Constraints Towards the Development of an Industry.</field><field name="creator">gavin.partridge@challengertafe.wa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Secondary salinisation has rendered over 100 million hectares of land throughout the world, and over 5 million hectares in Australia, unsuitable for conventional agriculture. The utilization of salinised land and its associated water resources for mariculture is an adaptive approach to this environmental problem with many potential economic, social and environmental benefits. Despite this, inland mariculture is yet to develop into an industrial-scale, rural enterprise. The main aim of this study was therefore to identify and address some of the technical and biological limitations to the development of an inland finfish mariculture industry. 

Three technical aspects essential to the development of an Australian inland mariculture industry were reviewed; potential sources of water, the species suitable for culture in these water sources and the production systems available to produce them. Based on factors such as their quantity, quality and proximity to infrastructure, the most appropriate water sources were deemed to be groundwater obtained from interception schemes and waters from operational or disused mines. In terms of species, mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) were identified as having many positive attributes for inland mariculture, including being temperate and therefore having the ability to be cultured year-round in the regions where the majority of secondary salinity occurs. Seasonal production of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in ponds in the temperate climatic zones has potential, but may be more appropriate for those salinised water sources located in the warmer parts of the country. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were also identified as having excellent potential provided water temperature can be maintained below the upper lethal limit and also have potential for seasonal production, perhaps in rotation with barramundi. In terms of production systems, pond-based culture methods were found to have many advantages specific to inland mariculture. Static ponds enable culture in areas with low groundwater yield and more cost-effective potassium supplementation compared with flow through ponds. Static ponds also largely overcome the issues associated with the disposal of salt-laden and eutrophied waste water; however yields from static ponds are typically low and limited by the nutrient input into the pond. 

In response to the yield constraints of static pond culture, a new culture technology known as the Semi-Intensive Floating Tank System (SIFTS) was designed, patented and constructed in collaboration with the aquaculture industry and tested in a static inland saline pond in the wheatbelt of Western Australia. This technology was designed to reduce nutrient input into ponds by the collection of settleable wastes and to provide large volumes of well-oxygenated water to the target species, to ameliorate the loss of fish from low dissolved oxygen during strong microalgal blooms. The three species identified above has having excellent potential for inland mariculture (mulloway, rainbow trout, and barramundi) were grown in SIFTS held within a 0.13 ha static, inland saline water body (salinity 14 ppt) over a period of 292 days, yielding the equivalent of 26 tonnes/ha/year (total for all three species). Rainbow trout were grown with an FCR of 0.97 from 83 to 697 grams over 111 days (SGR, 1.91%/day) between June and September, when average daily water temperatures ranged from 12.3&#132;aC to 18.2&#132;aC. Over the same time period, mulloway grew only from 100 to 116 grams, however, once temperatures increased to approximately 21&#132;aC in October, feed intake increased and mulloway grew to an average size of 384 grams over 174 days with an SGR and FCR of 0.68 %/day and 1.39, respectively. Barramundi stocked in November with an average weight of 40 grams increased to 435 grams in 138 days (SGR 1.73%/day) with an FCR of 0.90. The SIFTS significantly reduced nutrient input into the pond by removing settleable wastes as a thick sludge with a dry matter content of 5 to 10%. The total quantity of dry waste removed over the 292 day culture period was 527 kg (5 tonnes/ha/yr), which was calculated to contain 15 kg of nitrogen (144 kg/ha/yr) and 16 kg of phosphorus (153 kg/ha/yr). The release of soluble nutrients into the pond resulted in blooms of macro- and micro- algae which caused large and potentially lethal diurnal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen within the pond, however, comparatively stable levels of dissolved oxygen were maintained within each SIFT through the use of air lift pumps. 

It is well documented that saline groundwater is deficient in potassium which, depending on the extent of the deficiency, can negatively impact on the performance of marine species, including fish. The physiological effects of this deficiency on fish, however, have not been previously described. As such, I conducted a bioassay investigating the physiological effects of a hypersaline (45 ppt) groundwater source containing 25% of the potassium found in equivalent salinity seawater (i.e. 25% K-equivalence) on juvenile barramundi. Histopathological examination of moribund fish revealed severe degeneration and necrosis of skeletal muscles, marked hyperplasia of branchial chloride cells and renal tubular necrosis. Clinical chemistry findings included hypernatraemia and hyperchloridaemia of the blood plasma and lowered muscle potassium levels. It was concluded from this study that the principal cause of death of these barramundi was skeletal myopathy induced by unsustainable buffering of blood plasma potassium levels from the muscle. Although such hypokalaemic muscle myopathies have been previously described in mammals and birds, this was the first description of such myopathies in fish. 

It was hypothesized from the results described above that the physiological effects of potassium deficiency are dependent on salinity and that they would be ameliorated by potassium supplementation. These predictions were tested in a subsequent study which measured the effects of potassium supplementation between 25% and 100% K-equivalence on the growth, survival and physiological response of juvenile barramundi at hyperosmotic (45 ppt), near-isosmotic (15 ppt) and hyposmotic (5 ppt) salinities. Unlike those juvenile barramundi reared at 45 ppt and 25% K-equivalence in the previous study, those reared in 50% K-equivalence water at 45 ppt in this study survived for four weeks but lost weight; whereas at 75% and 100% K-equivalences fish both survived and gained weight. Homeostasis of blood plasma potassium was maintained by buffering from skeletal muscle. Fish reared in 50% K-equivalence at this salinity exhibited muscle dehydration, increased branchial, renal and intestinal (Na+-K+)ATPase activity and elevated blood sodium and chloride, suggesting they were experiencing osmotic stress. At 15 ppt, equal rates of growth were obtained between all K-equivalence treatments. Buffering of plasma potassium by muscle also occurred but appeared to be in a state of equilibrium. Barramundi at 5 ppt displayed equal growth among treatments. At this salinity, buffering of plasma potassium from muscle did not occur and at 25% K-equivalence blood potassium was significantly lower than at all other K-equivalence treatments but with no apparent effect on growth, survival or (Na+-K+)ATPase activities. These data confirmed the hypothesis that proportionally more potassium is required at hyperosmotic salinities compared to iso- and hypo- osmotic salinities and also demonstrated that barramundi have a lower requirement for potassium than other marine and estuarine species being investigated for culture in inland saline groundwater.

In addition to ongrowing fish, saline groundwater has potential for hatchery production. Specific advantages include the vertical integration of inland saline farms and the production of disease-free certified stock through isolation from the pathogens and parasites found naturally in coastal water. To determine the potential of utilizing inland saline groundwater for hatchery production, barramundi larvae were reared from 2 to 25 days post hatch in 14 ppt saline groundwater with either no potassium supplementation (38% K-equivalence) or full potassium supplementation (100% K-equivalence). Growth, survival and swimbladder inflation of these larvae were compared against those grown in control treatments of seawater (32 ppt) and seawater diluted to 14 ppt. Those reared in saline groundwater with 38% K-equivalence exhibited complete mortality within 2 days, whilst those held in groundwater with full supplementation survived at a rate equal to both control treatments (pooled average 51.1 &#161;&#211; 0.5%). At 25 days post hatch, there was no significant difference in larval length or dry weight between those grown in the 14 ppt control treatment and those in the saline groundwater with full potassium supplementation. There were no significant differences in swim bladder inflation between any of the surviving treatments (average 93.3 &#161;&#211; 2.5%). This is the first description of rearing barramundi larvae both in low salinity seawater and in saline groundwater, and demonstrates that the requirement for potassium by larval barramundi is higher than for juveniles of the same species.

In addition to a deficiency in potassium, saline groundwater in Western Australia often contains an elevated concentration of manganese relative to seawater as a result of anaerobic reduction of manganese oxides or the pedogenic weathering of manganese-bearing rock. The effects of elevated manganese on marine or estuarine fish have not been described and a study was therefore conducted to determine if manganese, at a concentration typical of that found in saline groundwater, has any impact on fish. The effects of 5 mg/L of dissolved manganese on juvenile mulloway at salinities of 5, 15 and 45 ppt were determined by comparing the survival, growth and blood and organ chemistry with those grown at the same salinities without manganese addition. Survival of mulloway at 45 ppt in the presence of 5 mg/L of manganese (73 &#161;&#211; 13%) was significantly lower than all other treatments, which achieved 100% survival. Those fish grown in seawater without manganese exhibited rapid growth, which was not affected by salinity (SGR = 4.05 &#161;&#211; 0.29%/day). Those fish grown at 5 ppt and 45 ppt in the presence of manganese lost weight over the two week trial (SGR  0.17 &#161;&#211; 0.42 and -0.44 &#161;&#211; 0.83%/day, respectively), whilst those at 15 ppt gained only a small amount of weight (SGR 1.70 &#161;&#211; 0.20%/day). Growth was therefore affected by manganese and by the interaction of manganese and salinity, but not salinity alone. Manganese was found to accumulate in the gills, liver and muscle of the fish. No gill epithelial damage or other significant histological findings were found, however, significant differences in blood chemistry were observed. Blood sodium and chloride of manganese exposed fish were significantly elevated in hyperosmotic salinity (45 ppt) and depressed at hyposmotic salinity (5 ppt) compared with unexposed fish; consistent with manganese causing apoptosis or necrosis to chloride cells. Blood potassium was significantly elevated and liver potassium significantly reduced at all salinities in the presence of manganese. These findings are consistent with manganese interfering with carbohydrate metabolism. There were no differences in blood sodium, chloride or potassium across salinities in fish not exposed to manganese, demonstrating mulloway are capable of efficient osmoregulation across this salinity range.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inland saline aquaculture</field><field name="subject">potassium deficiency</field><field name="subject">barramundi</field><field name="subject">trout</field><field name="subject">mulloway</field><field name="subject">Semi-Intensive Floating Tank System</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081021.100437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Hardenbergia mosaic virus and development of microarrays for detecting viruses in plants</field><field name="creator">cwebster82@gmail.com</field><field name="description">A virus causing chlorosis and leaf distortion in the Western Australian endemic legume Hardenbergia comptoniana was detected by biological indexing to Chenopodium quinoa and Nicotiana benthamiana.  Enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) using general Potyvirus antiserum and amplification by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers indicated that it was a species of Potyvirus. It was confirmed as an unknown member of the genus Potyvirus by comparing its coat protein sequence with those of other potyviruses.  The name Hardenbergia mosaic virus (HarMV) is proposed for this new virus species.  Isolates of HarMV were collected from 13 sites, covering much of the natural range of its host. An experimental host range was determined using nine virus isolates tested against plants from 11 species in three families.  Its infectivity on three leguminous species important in agriculture (Lupinus angustifolius, L. luteus and Trifolium subterraneum) was established.

The nucleotide (nt) sequences of the coat proteins (CP) of 28 isolates determined there was 24.1- 27.6% diversity with the closest known relative, Passion fruit woodiness virus (PWV). Studies of the nucleotide sequences of the CP showed that there was considerable intra-species divergence (mean 13.5%, maximum 20.5%) despite its relatively small geographical distribution and single known natural host. The observed broad diversity strongly suggests long genetic isolation and that HarMV evolved in the region where it was collected.  An examination of its phylogeny showed that 28 isolates clustered into eight clades with high bootstrap support (6.2-20.5% inter-clade diversity).  Isolates collected at locations distant to the Perth metropolitan area (Margaret River and Seabird) diverged more from isolates collected in the metropolitan area (15.4-21.1% nucleotide sequence diversity).  This virus represents the first endemic species to be characterised from Western Australia.

Differences in pathogenicity and symptoms induced on key host species were seen between isolates belonging to different phylogenetic clades.  Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the inclusion of HarMV within the Bean common mosaic virus group of the potyviruses and also defined a previously unreported subgroup of six previously described Potyvirus species (Clitoria virus Y, Hibbertia virus Y, PWV, Siratro 1 virus Y, and Siratro 2 virus Y), from Australia, which is further evidence for a prolonged period of genetic isolation.

Both in relation to detection of strains of HarMV, and considering the broader issues of biosecurity and parallel detection of plant viruses, a microarray based detection system was established.  To optimise conditions for the development of microarrays for virus detection poly-L-lysine (PLL) coated microscope slides produced in the laboratory were compared to commercially produced PowerMatrix slides (Full Moon BioSystems). Variables tested for PLL slide production were: choice of printing buffer, probe concentration, method of immobilisation and slide blocking; and in particular the print buffer and immobilisation method had the greatest effect on the quality of PLL microarray slides.  Slides printed on PLL surfaces in a high salt buffer (3x Saline sodium citrate) supplemented with 1.5M betaine and immobilised at 42oC overnight retained the highest amounts of probe DNA of the methods tested.  Qualitative comparisons of the two showed more probe was retained on PowerMatrix slides which were also more reliable and consistent than the PLL slides.

Probes were designed for eight different virus species and six distinct strains of HarMV to test the potential to use microarrays to distinguish between them. Probes were designed to detect potyviruses at the genus, species and strain levels. Although there was evidence of non-specific hybridisation, the Potyvirus array was used to identify six strains of HarMV by hybridisation to species specific probes.  Additionally the array was used to identify three other species of Potyvirus: Bean yellow mosaic virus, PWV and Passiflora foetida virus Y, following amplification with polyvalent PCR primers.

In further microarray tests, using labelled first strand cDNA of Potato virus X (PVX) and Potato virus Y (PVY) on an array, PVX was strongly detected in leaves known to be infected, but PVY was only weakly detected in infected leaves.  Three methods of pre-amplification of virus nucleic acid before hybridisation to the array were investigated to improve the sensitivity of the assay.  Two of the methods, Klenow amplification and randomly primed PCR, amplified the target virus; as confirmed by real time PCR.  Of the methods tested only randomly primed PCR improved the sensitivity of the microarray.  The best amplification method used genus-specific primers with adaptor sequences.  This method when tested by real time PCR showed a 3.7Ct reduction for PVX and 16.8Ct for PVY.  The microarray correctly identified both viruses.

In this work the first virus (HarMV) endemic to Western Australia was identified, and microarray methods were developed both to identify HarMV and other plant viruses of economic importance.  The microarray approach, with further development, may be applicable as a means of identifying incursions of new viruses in a biosecurity situation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microarrays</field><field name="subject">Plant Virus</field><field name="subject">Potyvirus and  Hardenbergia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081021.103144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching Hatha Yoga: An Auto-Ethnographic Study.</field><field name="creator">jane.syd@bigpond.net.au</field><field name="description">This dissertation is grounded in my praxis as a Hatha yoga teacher in the community. I
noticed that particular students were drawn to specific styles of Hatha yoga, whilst
avoiding others. I took the styles of Hatha yoga into consideration, but further
exploration also gave rise to whether methods of instruction were a fundamental
component of the class demography. This in turn led to an examination of my own
teaching pedagogy to explore how my philosophical approach to teaching, was in fact,
carried over into to my praxis and if this was a factor in student retention in my classes.
Studying my own pedagogy as a Hatha yoga teacher meant reviewing my philosophies,
both from a theoretical perspective and later from a practical level, to see if my practice
followed my philosophy. This could only be realised through a full investigation of my
teaching methods, which was achieved by video taping one of my Hatha yoga classes. I
believe that understanding originates from personal knowledge; therefore, the research
must begin by examining my own pedagogy. In order to answer these questions I have
investigated the historical foundations of yoga and the meaning of yoga in the modern
Western world. During this process I became aware of the misrepresentations of Hatha
yoga and the misconceptions that have derived from this. In order to answer my
research question, whether my teaching pedagogy directly influenced the cohort of
students who attended my yoga class, I have had to be cognisant of my own pedagogy.
In order to achieve this I employed heuristic enquiry and more specifically the methods
outline by Clark Moustakas (1990). Heuristic epistemology is achieved by creating
phases in which the researcher uses her own experience to investigate and create
meaning in which to discover a phenomenon. This method of enquiry offers the
researcher non-linear steps with which to structure the process of a personal reflection.
Explication of the pedagogy resulted from numerous viewings of the video recording. I
reviewed my teaching methods to ascertain if what I said and thought I was doing was
what I actually taught.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hatha yoga</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081022.110605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conformity and resistance:
Discursive struggles in the Australian mental health field</field><field name="creator">Holland, Kate E</field><field name="description">This research explores areas of contention in the mental heath field in Australia through a
qualitative analysis of voices and practices that can broadly be seen as talking with and
talking back to psychiatry. The thesis is informed by key shifts in thinking that underpin
postpsychiatry and analyses a set of materials through an interpretive lens of reading
psychiatry against the grain (Bracken &amp; Thomas, 2005; Lewis, 2006). In particular, it
examines a failed ethics application to conduct research with people diagnosed with a mental
illness, an anti-stigma campaign, the practices of some prominent mental health organisations
in Australia, a conversation with two members of an emerging consumer/survivor network in
Australia, and a television documentary and online discussion forum about an antidepressant
medication. The research draws from discourse analytic methods and concepts from social
movement framing research to identify factors shaping conformity and resistance to
psychiatric doxa in the Australian mental health field.
The research identifies the discursive repertoires that characterise the mental health field as a
"game" in which competing perspectives vie for recognition. In relation to research ethics
committees, the thesis argues that deference to clinical expertise is a potential barrier to
cultural studies of psychiatry and a more inclusive agenda in mental heath research and
practice. Some practices for ethics committees to consider when reviewing research that
involves people who may have been diagnosed with a mental illness are proposed. The
research also identifies problematic features of anti-stigma campaigns that direct their efforts
toward protecting and promoting the discourse of biomedical psychiatry. A critique of this
type of campaign is offered in relation to perspectives from postpsychiatry and social
constructionism. On the basis of this research, it is argued that organisations that champion
"mental health literacy" are limited in their ability to give voice to the goals and priorities of
those who are calling for a more open, reflexive and democratic debate in mental health. The
central argument of this thesis is that elevating first-person and postpsychiatry perspectives is
necessary in order to interrogate and address the dominance of the medical model in
psychiatry and its consequences.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">anti-stigma campaign</field><field name="subject">antidepressant medication</field><field name="subject">mental illness</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081022.153830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The magnificent play of light: seeing the difference</field><field name="creator">Porritt, Dawn</field><field name="description">Light as a concept is filled with a multitude of interpretations, ideas and possibilities and
no matter how technologically progressive we think we are, nature consistently controls
our human way of life. We are surrounded by nature and often gain inspiration by the
simple things around us. My interest in the phenomena of light and refraction was
sparked years ago by Claude Monet?s painting Bathers at La Grenouillere, 1869. It
showed simplicity of form and shape, yet emitted a luminosity and radiance of light
reflecting off water.
This thesis examines the subject of light as an optical phenomenon. My specific aim was
to create distorted, ambiguous and conflicting images in my photographs by using the
"optical phenomena" of light such as, refraction, diffraction and reflection as a basis for
abstracting reality. I wanted to capture the changes that occur when light changes
direction due to refractive qualities within a material such as glass, water or plastic, or
due to the reflective qualities of a surface.
The camera was exploited for its capacity to capture realism, but also to capture and
abstract natural phenomenon. The images were enlarged to magnify details and the
reality of the physical world was heightened as objects became ambiguous. Design
compositional techniques were used to decontextualise objects.
I approached this study with the idea that observation and awareness has importance to
image making within my design and teaching practice. This thesis presents my project
explorations showing the play of light on and through surfaces under different conditions.
I have documented this by producing a series of photographic images and a glossary as
an aid in the practice of design education.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">light</field><field name="subject">optical phenomena</field><field name="subject">refraction</field><field name="subject">reflection</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20081023.115855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Steel Magnolias&#146; Healing Journeys: Rural women speak of transforming their lives after the experience of childhood sexual assault.</field><field name="creator">Allen-Kelly, Kandie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the construction of healing from childhood sexual assault from the perspective of adult women who had been sexually abused in their childhood years. The purpose of the study is to provide a space to hear the stories of rural women, and a forum to allow those stories to be shared with a wider audience. Its focus is on the women&#146;s accounts of how their lives have been shaped by those experiences, what transformation has occurred, what people and processes have helped or hindered their journey and how they construct healing. It aims to develop an understanding of the notion of healing as reported by survivors themselves and does this though an emancipatory methodology underpinned by a critical post-modern framework. This study differs from previous studies in that its focus is specifically on the construction of healing and its participants are all rural women. The qualitative research methodology demonstrated in this thesis maintained a focus on the women&#146;s narratives. It employed a unique method &#150; a ten week discussion group in which the women chose the issues to be examined. The presentation of the data, maintains the commitment to the primacy of the women&#146;s accounts. It utilises the themes they decided upon as well as those which emerged from the literature. The constructions of healing, which emerged from the sharing of stories, include healing as a non-linear process where individual strengths and transformation is acknowledged. The thesis argues that healing includes all aspects of survivors&#146; lives such as their relationships, parenting and engagement with their community. The implication for social work practice is that service provision to assist healing must focus on more than psychological and behavioural effects of childhood sexual assault. The method of collecting the women&#146;s stories also has great potential for social work research because as the thesis argues, while generalisations cannot be made from the findings, the actual method has great value in giving voice to marginalised groups.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Rural women</field><field name="subject">Sexual abuse</field><field name="subject">Childhood sexual assault</field><field name="subject">Construction of healing</field><field name="subject">Social work practice</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp13.25072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of the Use of Self-Regulated Learning Strategies on College Students' Performance and Satisfaction in Physical Education</field><field name="creator">Ao, Man-Chih</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate whether using self-regulated learning strategies could promote college students&#8217; learning and satisfaction in Physical Education. A quasi-experimental design, experimental group (N =49) and control group (N=51), was used to examine the effectiveness of a teaching intervention in achieving the goals of learning and satisfaction. Students undertaking the self-regulated learning intervention were compared with a group participating in standard curriculum instructional conditions. Three questionnaires were administered to identify 1) students&#8217; entry characteristics, 2) their perceptions of their learning experiences, and 3) satisfaction. Students completed a students&#8217; characteristics questionnaire in week 2. During the module, students responded to a learning experience questionnaire. At the conclusion of the module, students completed a tennis skills test and responded to a satisfaction questionnaire. The conceptual framework for this study included the independent variables of teaching strategy, mediating variables (students&#8217; characteristics), and dependent variables (satisfaction and performance). The experimental study was conducted within this framework by use of an ANCOVA design. The main results were: 1. The experimental group scored significantly higher on measures reflecting self regulated learning processes in their learning experience than the control group (p=0.000).2. There was no difference between the groups on scores for global satisfaction (p=0.059).3. There was no difference between the groups on satisfaction through valuing (p=0.401). 4. The experimental group demonstrated significantly higher students' satisfaction through enjoyment than the control group (p=0.013).5. The experimental group had significantly higher performance in the tennis skills test than the control group (p=0.000). Several effects of self-regulated learning were indicated in this study. Analysis of the monitoring sheets provided evidence that students gained more interest and confidence in their involvement in the tennis class by the use of self-regulated learning strategies. However, it was expected that the self-regulated learning group would experience the greater satisfaction. As this did not occur, more research is needed to further examine the relationship of learning experiences to satisfaction and particularly the dimension of valuing. The importance of utilizing a conceptual framework that accounted for differences in student entry characteristics in a teaching intervention of this nature was demonstrated by the ANCOVA analysis. The individual factors of managing environmental change, problem solving, ability attributions, and task orientation were all shown to have some significant effects on student outcomes over and above those attributed to the learning experience. Finally, some interesting findings concerning the composition of the scales used in the study were reported. They were interpreted as providing evidence for the importance of verifying the cultural appropriateness of even well-known theoretical concepts that may have been developed in different contexts to those in which they are being used. The study concludes with some specific recommendations for future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical education</field><field name="subject">Self-regulated learning strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp117.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Successful Implementation and Management of Educational Technology in Three New South Wales Primary Schools</field><field name="creator">Ashleigh, Douglas Anthony</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this dissertation is to analyse why three New South Wales primary schools were successful in implementing and managing educational technology. Responding to this research focus four specific questions were considered: Why have these schools been successful in implementing and managing educational technology? What factors have helped and/or hindered the successful implementation and management of educational technology within the selected schools? What are the indicators of successful implementation of educational technology? What were the particular contributions of leadership to the successful implementation and management of educational technology within the selected schools? This qualitative research study is based on the assumption that valuable data are gathered by studying schools that have been successful with the implementation and management of technology. In particular, the study provided a description and analysis of the best practice in three New South Wales Primary schools that had successfully implemented and managed educational technology. An interactive and cyclical process of data analysis was employed with data collection, data analysis and theory development proceeding simultaneously. To reduce and display data gathered from in-depth interviews, document study and non- participant observation the qualitative data analysis program QSR NUD*IST was utilised. The development and validation of the study&#8217;s conceptual framework shaped the study leading to the formulation of the SupportIF Model of Implementation. This model posits that success with implementation and management of educational technology is closely related to the level of interdependence between the implementation factors. The study results also endorsed the prime importance of a supportive work environment in each of the studied schools and linked this environment to the level of success realised with the implementation and management of technology and the utilisation of educational technology to enhance the achievement of student learning outcomes. The study contends that the sustainability of a school based technology initiative rests with a school&#8217;s ability to dynamically balance the key implementation factors and to redesign in light of shared practice. Tantamount to this process is a supportive work environment in each school which is the critical variable that facilitates interdependence between leadership, resources, relationships and teaching and learning factors.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary shools</field><field name="subject">Educational technology</field><field name="subject">Technology management</field><field name="subject">Technology implementation</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp71.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heeding the Voices &#8211; Through Learning to Healing: An Application of Single and Double Loop Learning in a Case Study of Past Practice</field><field name="creator">Baldwin, Antoinette Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis responds to the current climate of inquiry and complaint around past practice in the work of religious, charitable and service based organisations. It does not attempt to deal with issues of abuse or of illegal or unlawful practice but rather proposes an alternative approach to inquiry into past practice. In focussing on the learnings for one organisation whose practice was under inquiry the study presents a response that is life giving, growth promoting and the first step to healing and reconciliation. In June 1998 the Honourable Faye Lo Po&#8217;, MP instructed that the Standing Committee on Social Issues inquire into Adoption Practices in NSW 1950 -1998 (the Inquiry). The Sisters of St Joseph, a religious Congregation in NSW chose to participate in the Inquiry. They had been entrusted with the care of single pregnant women since 1937 at St Margaret&#8217;s Hospital in Sydney and St Anthony&#8217;s Home in Croydon. Recommendation 17 of Releasing the Past, the final report of the Inquiry suggests that an apology from organisations involved in adoption services be forthcoming. This recommendation proved to be the catalyst for this study. No real apology exists without reconciliation. Reconciliation is possible only when both sides of the story are told and understood. This thesis seeks to understand not just both sides of the story but the changes and the learnings that have taken place in the provision of care to single mothers over the eventful fifty years embraced by the Inquiry. Using the metaphor of voice as discourse, dialogue and response the study examines the discourses that informed attitudes to the single mother in the fifty years leading up to the Inquiry; listens to the events of the Inquiry and identifies the research question which focuses on inquiry into past practice and the consequent understanding of organisational and individual learnings. The evolutionary nature of organisational learning provides a framework for understanding the learnings that have taken place. Using case study methodology the study situates the ministry in the changing social, religious and professional culture of the time. It examines the evidence of the mothers who told their stories to the Inquiry and sets up a dialogue between this evidence and the recollections of the Sisters involved in the ministry. While the discourses and the voices of the mothers have been explored in other publications the author was unable to access any other studies that examined issues through the eyes of those who were deemed to have been perpetrators of the actions under inquiry. It is hoped that the study may serve as the first step towards understanding the stories of both groups of women &#8211; for this is the first step towards reconciliation. It is further hoped that it provides a model of learning that enables organisations to understand and appreciate the richness of their learning history &#8211; especially when the catalyst for that understanding is complaint and inquiry.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adoption practice</field><field name="subject">Organisational learning</field><field name="subject">Sisters of Saint Joseph</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp160.05062008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between Towns: Religious Life and Leadership during a Time of Critical Change</field><field name="creator">Barnett, Jan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to explore and delineate leadership practices, which could facilitate the transition of Catholic religious institutes into the world of the third millennium, within groups facing the diminishment, and even death, of current forms of religious life. Hermeneutical phenomenology, particularly as developed by Ricoeur, provided the philosophical base for an analysis of the multiple hermeneutical dimensions of culture, human sciences, spirituality and religion. Elements of postmodernism and feminism were also found to be useful starting points. Qualitative research provided the mechanisms out of which meaningful data was elicited and text and context explored. An extensive literature review and individual interviews with thirty women and men in leadership positions in religious institutes formed the basis of the research. Initial findings were tested against the insights of a focus group of religious involved and interested in the future of religious life and its leadership. Additionally, the responses of the leaders of religious congregations in NSW at their annual conference provided a valuable sounding board for the research findings. Core to the study, respondents believed, was a changing concept of God, described in the interviews as &#8216;the larger God&#8217;, and named as the foundation of contemporary religious commitment. A second fundamental call was pinpointed as that of radical commitment to &#8216;the other&#8217;. &#8216;Commitment to, and relationship with, the other&#8217; was seen as a critical focus for religious organisations in an increasingly divided and polarised world. For women and men currently in the midst of religious life transition, identity, mission and community were identified as specific orientations from which unfamiliar and emerging forms of &#8216;the larger God&#8217; and &#8216;relationship with the other&#8217; were examined. Authenticating leadership was used to describe the form of leadership believed to be necessary during this time of transition to endorse and authenticate the tentative sparks of new life. This leadership was depicted as stimulated by a sense of spiritual dynamism and an outward focus, activating the motivation of the congregation towards &#8216;the larger God&#8217; and &#8216;the other&#8217;. Energising, empowering and challenging the group were described as intrinsic to these orientations. Demonstrating authenticity, embracing diversity, accepting suffering as the inevitable price of effective contemporary leadership, and &#8216;holding leadership lightly&#8217;, were also highlighted as essential elements for a leadership aimed at authenticating diverse expressions of new forms of religious life. Two clear leadership practices were named as essential for effective transition during this period of decisive transformation. Consciously managing the disintegration and death of current expressions of religious life, while simultaneously mobilising the energies of small emergent groups to explore and attempt new and diverse forms, were seen as the most difficult, but probably the most critical, challenges for leadership at this time.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Leadership practice</field><field name="subject">Religious life</field><field name="subject">Catholic church</field><field name="subject">Religious congregations</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp92.29052006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leadership in a Lutheran School: an Exploration of principal and school pastor worldviews and their potential impact on the transformation of the school learning community</field><field name="creator">Bartel, Kenneth Cyril</field><field name="description">This ethnomethodological study focuses on the worldviews of Lutheran school principals and pastors. Essentially, these leaders in a Lutheran school provide direction and vision for the school learning community. The degree to which their worldviews coalesce will naturally result in positive or negative influences on the whole school community. These leaders within the Lutheran school can be seen as a hub for all kinds of learning experiences and interaction in the context of vital Christian communities in mission outreach and quality education. Any dissonance of worldview has potential for impact on school processes and relationships.  The Lutheran Church has defined the role of the pastor in the school and the difference from his role in a congregation (Lutheran Church of Australia, 2002).  Lutheran principals have a delegated authority from their school councils to be responsible for the complete oversight of the school&#8217;s direction, the observance of policies, and the assignment of tasks and duties of staff. The blurring of responsibility occurs over the pastor&#8217;s rightful responsibility in regards to a word and sacrament ministry. In a Lutheran school where the Gospel is to inform all learning, such tension can cloud school dynamics and transformation.  The Lutheran church policy, Relative responsibilities of pastor and principal within the Lutheran school, identifies three critical areas of required mutual respect for the Principal and School Pastor: theological, professional and personal (Lutheran Church of Australia, 2001, p. 3). Thus, the &#8216;worldview&#8217; dimensions considered in this research centre around the theological, the educational and the interpersonal domains. The school transformation themes of lifelong learning, postmodernism and curriculum, school organization and change, and school community relationships are used to challenge worldview dimensions of Principals and School Pastors through a series of online &#8216;stories&#8217;, or scenarios, backed by personal interviews and a document study. The identification of school leadership tension points brings about recommendations for action.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lutheran school principals</field><field name="subject">Lutheran pastors</field><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">School learning community</field><field name="subject">Christian education</field><field name="subject">Lutheran church of Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp43.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Theory Practice Interface: A case study of experienced nurses' perception of their role as clinical teachers</field><field name="creator">Beattie, Heather</field><field name="description">This research explores how experienced nurses perceive their role as clinical teachers in an environment that is challenged not only with on-going changes in healthcare delivery, but also by the expectation that it will continue to provide positive clinical learning opportunities for undergraduate student nurses. Schools of nursing in Australia have undergone rapid and far-reaching change as a consequence of the legislated transfer of nursing eduction to the tertiary sector. Expectations that nurse academics will possess higher degrees and be actively involved in research mean that faculty members have less time to be directly involved in their students&#146; learning during clinical practice placements. The literature indicates that the responsibility for moment to moment teaching and learning thus appears to have been implicitly given to clinical staff who may not possess any formal qualifications for teaching, yet are largely responsible for students&#146; learning through clinical placements. Indeed some clinicians report a worrying lack of knowledge of clinical supervision models giving cause for further concern about the nature of the clinical learning environment. Schools of nursing expect that clinical practica will provide opportunities for students to learn how to be a nurse through guided questioning, analysis and critical thinking. It is evident that in some settings, this represents an ideal situation and not the reality. Critical reflection on these issues has informed the purpose of this research and helped to shape the following questions that focus the conduct of the study: Research Question One. How do experienced nurses create positive clinical learning environments for student nurses? Research Question Two. How do experienced nurses resolve the often-contradictory demands of nursing students and those of the practice setting? Research Question Three. How do changes in the healthcare environment impact on the experienced nurse's role as a clinical teacher? The theoretical framework for this study was underpinned by the interpretive philosophies of hermeneutic phenomenology and symbolic interactionism, because they acknowledge the personal experiences and meanings of the participants. A case study approach was utilised because it acknowledges the given context of the participants. Data were collected from six experienced nurses through a series of semi-structured interviews, informal interviews and periods of participant observation supported by field notes and the researcher&#146;s diary. Participants identified that their perception of their role as clinical teachers was constructed of three intersecting roles: that of facilitator of learning, assessor and socialiser. This study concludes that several factors influence these nurses&#146; perception of their role as clinical teachers. In particular, the positivist work culture of the clinical setting and nurses&#146; own past experiences and world view of nursing combine to shape these nurses&#146; perception of their role as clinical teachers. The research concludes that the expectations that students will be supported in their endeavours to be critically thinking, problem solving and reflective practitioners may, in fact, be unrealistic in the current, economically constrained, clinical environment. It is evident that experienced nurses, despite being willing to be involved with clinical teaching, have to function in rapidly changing environments that do not always offer opportunities for nurses to reflect on their practice. However, the creation of positive clinical learning environments in these circumstances requires an increased understanding and appreciation by both schools of nursing and their students of the impact of change on these nurses and their clinical environment. This appreciation may result in more effective collaboration between nursing education and nursing service to assist student nurses to learn not merely through repetitive practice and busywork, but also through opportunities to observe, question and understand their nursing practice.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Experienced Nurses</field><field name="subject">Nurse training</field><field name="subject">Student nurses</field><field name="subject">Nursing practice</field><field name="subject">Clinical learning</field><field name="subject">Clinical teaching</field><field name="subject">Clinical practica</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp3.14072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the House Motif in the Gospel of Mark</field><field name="creator">Beggs, Brian Victor J</field><field name="description">This study analyses the role of the house motif in Mark&#8217;s Gospel since in the tradition, Jesus healed, forgave sin, taught and shared meals as well as the Last Supper in the house. It is argued that Mark was composed for a Gentile, Hellenist Christian house group in Rome and written soon after Nero&#8217;s persecution (64-65 CE) of the Christian house-church communities and prior to the destruction of the temple in 70 CE. Though other studies support alternate sites in Galilee, Southern Syria and the Transjordan as the source of the Gospel, the traditional arguments favouring Rome indicate that Mark is a Hellenist Gospel written for the majority Law-free Christian household groups in Rome as Paul&#8217;s letter attests in 58 CE. The Gospel offers hope in following the way of the secret of the kingdom. In Mark&#8217;s terms, the secret is Jesus&#8217; servant dedication to his messianic ministry, climaxing in his crucifixion and resurrection. There is no description of Jesus&#8217; resurrection in the Gospel; in part unnecessary since, from its opening, the Gospel presumes the power and authority of the crucified, risen Son of Man, the Lord. As Lord, he calls disciples to follow him along the way of eschatological servant dedication in the spatial context of the typical, urban house-church. Consequently, within the house motif, Mark sets out the minor characters&#8217; response in faith and hope to the Lord&#8217;s authoritative call, healing, forgiveness and Eucharistic unity in the house. In contrast, the narrative synagogue groups first react only with astonishment to Mark&#8217;s messianic Jesus. But, under the authorities&#8217; leadership, the Jewish response hardens into total rejection of Jesus as Mark&#8217;s gradually enlarges Israel&#8217;s negative response to Mark&#8217;s symbolic visitation, judgment and rejection theme of the temple due to the opposition of the Jewish authorities and their abuse of the Law and the temple liturgy. Mark has no pastoral interest in a remote Jerusalem or its temple. From the Gospel's &#8217;s viewpoint, his real aim is the visitation of Rome&#8217;s house-church groups through the living Word of the risen Jesus of Nazareth. Israel&#8217;s negative narrative response acts as a literary backdrop to the faith responses in the house. As a result, through its misused Law and temple traditions, Israel ensures its symbolic visitation and rejection. Concurrently, in house-churches sustained by faith, and the authoritative Word of the risen Son of Man, challenges Christians in Rome to a renewed fidelity in way, covenant service. Therefore, under the mantle of the house motif, the Gospel offers &#8216;the secret of kingdom of God&#8217; - Jesus&#8217; life as the selfless servant - as the basis for individual and communal hope. Christians live in the aftermath of severe persecution. These house groups are challenged to live the paradox of faith in life through death, gain through loss, in following a crucified/risen Lord in servant dedication. This appears to be particularly Mark's aim in his close linking of the two motifs, the house and the way, during the journey of Jesus and the disciples on the way to Jerusalem from Galilee. Throughout, he accents eschatological house-churches; their members live the secret of the kingdom in faith, hope and mutual selflessness. Thus, as Lord of the House, Jesus goes before Rome&#8217;s Christian groups in his ever-present living and dying in his glorified humanity. By following Jesus of Nazareth in servant discipleship in a house community, Christians blend their existential human becoming with that of the glorified Lord. Hence Mark clearly expects Christians to see the &#8216;things of God&#8217; as their Spirit-inspired servant charity. In this way, they daily deepen their Christian unification with Jesus&#8217; own dedication as the Beloved Servant/Son in his obedience to his Father&#8217;s will. This is the gift that Mark points to &#8216;now in this time&#8217;. Mark stresses this sense of the victorious, fruitful presence of the glorified Son of Man, the Lord, from the opening of the Gospel. The superscription and the fact that he addresses Christians, who already know Jesus as the triumphant Lord, allow him to write from a post resurrection viewpoint. So, within the scope of the house motif, Mark encourages a deeper faith and hope in the efficacy of Christian self-identification with Jesus in his victorious way of the cross.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mark&#8217;s Gospel</field><field name="subject">Christian house-church communities</field><field name="subject">Christian history</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp110.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Deeper Purposes of Testimony: A philosophical study of the relationship between testimony and the emergence of mind</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Peter Henry</field><field name="description">This dissertation argues for the truth of two fundamental premises: that testimony is the primary source of knowledge in human beings, and that testimony accounts for the emergence and formation of human minds. The thesis argues that the human ability to perceive as&#8230;, to remember as&#8230;, and to infer as&#8230;, is due to the say-so of others. All human beings, in virtue of being sentient beings, are able to experience both the external world and their own private states of consciousness, this work contends, however, that our ability to experience as&#8230; is a consequence of our emergence in a world of epistemic transactions and encounters, the most basic of which are explicated by the epistemological notion of testimony. The work argues, then, that we live in an interpreted world &#8211; a world interpreted by those who have gone before us. The thesis argues further, that the world-view that is built within us as a consequence of the sayings of others, induces and forms human minds. The work makes a strong commitment to the Kantian categories and that philosopher&#8217;s thesis of Transcendental Idealism. On the shoulders of the Kantian a priori, however, the dissertation argues that the formation of human doxastic structures is due to what one&#8217;s epistemic elders say about what is. As such, the thesis seeks to establish a fundamental link between ontology, epistemology, and the concept of mind. The work proposes a view of the concept of truth that synthesises the Correspondence Theory of Truth, the Coherence Theory of Truth, with a theory of meaning &#8211; I name this synthesis a Unified Theory of Truth. Extensive consideration is given to the concept of evidence and the role of trust in epistemic transactions. The work concludes with a consideration of the possibility that human beings may be able to have experiences as&#8230; that transcend the ways of &#8216;seeing&#8217; that are due to testimony. An explanatory theory is posited that the writings and testimonies of mystics provide evidence that human beings are capable of meaningful experiences which cannot be accommodated by the conceptual structures that otherwise make meaning possible. The dissertation is argued in seven chapters and is constructed thus: Chapter One The thesis is stated in four premises: 1. that the testimony of others, with respect to what is the case (or may be the case), is the primary source of our beliefs about what is the case (or may be the case) 2. that the testimony of others provides adequate relevant grounds for one to claim to know what is the case 3. that education is testimony 4. that the formation and emergence of mind is due to testimony Significant presuppositions are identified and discussed. A brief argument in support of the thesis is posited. Reference is made to the evolution of the argument and the overall structure and organisation of the project is elucidated. Chapter Two The second chapter is dedicated to a detailed and extensive analysis of epistemic justification. I argue that the &#8216;evidence condition&#8217; of the tripartite analysis of propositional knowledge is sometimes misapplied by those who argue that its function is to verify propositions. I argue that its function is to justify beliefs and that it does not verify that p &#8211; the evidence condition &#8216;tracks&#8217; the belief condition, not the truth condition. I also examine the concept of evidence itself. Chapter Three A detailed examination of the concepts of &#8216;testimony&#8217;, &#8216;epistemic dependence&#8217; and &#8216;epistemic independence&#8217; is undertaken. I argue for the centrality and primacy of testimony in the formation of beliefs and subsequently one&#8217;s doxastic structures. I argue that testimony plays a fundamental role in the process of education and that this fact points to its significance and importance in epistemic transactions and the emergence of rational and self-reflective minds. Chapter Four In the fourth chapter I advert to the difficulty encountered in (a) embracing a strong commitment to intellectual autonomy and (b) accepting the say-so of others on trust. In the light of this observation, I undertake a linguistic conceptual analysis of the concept of trust and then examine the role trust plays in the acquisition of beliefs. I argue that the concept of trust does not exclude critical appraisal, but that when one trusts, one must be disposed to act in a certain way. I argue that although trust does play a fundamental role in formation of beliefs induced by the say-so of others, this does not make impossible critical appraisal of the attestations of others. Chapter Five In this chapter I note my agreement with other philosophers that testimony is the speech-act of attesting, but put up an argument that it is also the speech-act of informing. In consequence I undertake an analysis of the concept of information and examine the mechanisms and processes which are at work that enable &#8216;bits&#8217; to become information for an entity or system. I argue that because testimony is the speech-act of informing, it is involved in the actual formation of human minds and, therefore, that we can attribute to testimony a deeper purpose than merely attesting to certain states of affairs. I argue that testimony builds, for human beings, a world-view and that it plays a fundamental role in how we come to interpret the experience of being. Chapter Six In the sixth and penultimate chapter I develop my thoughts on the relationship between a priori understandings, testimony, and meaning. I argue that there is a logical relationship between belief acquisition, meaning, and the emergence of fully developed human minds. In this chapter I give consideration to the possibility of thought, belief, and the existence of mind in non-human animals and pre-linguistic humans. I argue that there are good reasons to believe that non-human animals think and maybe develop understandings, but that the possession of mind, in the sense that one can be mindful and therefore attach meaning to experience and be conscious of self, is limited to human beings. I underwrite this view by adverting to the centrality of testimony within the human condition. Chapter Seven In the final chapter of this dissertation I move to a more speculative mode of philosophising and consider whether or not there may be meaningful human experiences which are not interpreted through the conceptual schema acquired as a consequence of the say-so of others. I undertake this speculation by examining the testimony of those who claim to have perceived God directly and those who seek to speak of purported mystical experiences. I also consider some counter-arguments to my thesis that have not been examined in previous chapters. I conclude that there may be meaningful experiences for human beings that lie beyond interpretation and that concepts such as &#8216;ineffability&#8217; point to our attempts to speak of experiences which transcend our doxastic structures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immanuel Kant</field><field name="subject">Mind</field><field name="subject">Testimony</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp151.19052008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes to Reading: An Investigation Across the Primary Years</field><field name="creator">Black, Anne-Marie L</field><field name="description">Students&#8217; attitudes to reading and the texts they choose to read impact on literacy achievement and willingness to engage with literacy-related activities in the primary years of schooling. This study was conducted in an urban Catholic school in Queensland in Years 1 to 7. Students&#8217; developing attitudes to reading and the perceptions of these attitudes held by their teachers were examined. An adapted version of the Elementary Reading Attitude Survey (McKenna &amp; Kear, 1990) and Teacher Checklist (Young, 2003) was utilized. Results from the study indicate older students&#8217; attitudes towards recreational reading (in primary school) are not significantly different to younger students&#8217; attitudes. Female students however, show more positive attitudes to recreational reading than male students. Older students&#8217; attitudes towards academic reading are more negative overall and female students showed significantly more positive attitudes than their male peers. Students&#8217; choice of texts varied across the year levels with the most preferred reading materials being chapter books, children&#8217;s magazines and comics. Teachers&#8217; perceptions of students&#8217; enjoyment of reading in class correlated significantly with students&#8217; own perceived level of reading achievement. Teachers perceive that as students&#8217; level of reading enjoyment increases, their level of academic reading achievement also increases. Five recommendations are made from the findings of this study. First, recreational reading engagement needs to be publicly promoted and positively celebrated within the school community. It was found that for students to be motivated and see the value of engaging in reading they must be immersed in a school classroom environment that offers a range of recreational activities and opportunities. Second, a structured approach to literacy sessions (literacy block) needs to be established and implemented with students across all primary year levels. This enables students to be scaffolded in their literacy learning and so develop positive attitudes towards themselves as academic readers. Third, it is recommended that guided reading occur as a key instructional approach to the teaching of reading across all primary year levels. This may serve to increase students&#8217; motivation and interest in reading a range of text types and may provide a source of information for the teacher in relation to students&#8217; engagement with reading. Fourth, a range of text types need to be purchased and made available for students to read independently and for teachers to use in class shared reading activities across all primary year levels. Students should be exposed to various text types throughout their primary years of schooling. Finally, the teaching of reading needs to be &#8216;data-driven&#8217; rather than based on teachers&#8217; perceptions of students&#8217; reading needs. Periodic assessments of students&#8217; reading achievement should occur to provide these data for teachers. The recommendations from this study align with priorities and recommendations included in current Commonwealth and State documents. Directions for future research also are suggested especially for qualitative data collection. This methodology, if included, would glean more in-depth data concerning students&#8217; attitudes to reading and the perceptions held by their teachers. Investigating students&#8217; attitude towards and use of digital literacies also would provide a greater understanding of primary-age students&#8217; attitudes towards reading in the 21st century.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reading</field><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="subject">Texts</field><field name="subject">Teaching reading</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp136.17052007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indicators of Satisfaction &amp; Success For a Paediatric Outreach Nursing Service in Metropolitan Sydney, NSW</field><field name="creator">Boss, Patricia M.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to determine the indicators of customer satisfaction and service success of a newly established paediatric outreach nursing service. Referring agents and care recipients were both consumers of the paediatric outreach nursing service. Both groups of consumers were surveyed to determine their satisfaction with the service delivery. Two satisfaction survey tools were developed to measure customer satisfaction. The tools were piloted and refined prior to distributing them. Both tools had a series of closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Eight service indicators were developed. These were designed to test the effectiveness of the service provided. The service indicators were piloted over two periods of three months and then modified based on the findings of the pilot period. The Paediatric Outreach Service (POS) is a positive service model for health care delivery. The survey results indicated that stakeholders were generally satisfied with the service delivery. When measured against service indicators that were developed for POS, the service performance was above average, with some opportunity to improve practice. Underpinned by a family-centered framework, POS has the capacity to empower children and their families in the planning and implementation of a management plan for the child&#8217;s illness. Such empowerment may lead families to practice better healthcare, develop better health-seeking practices and ultimately lead to healthier children. The results from this study has implications for nursing practice. The data obtained from this study may be useful to service providers considering commencing a paediatric outreach nursing service. Data may also be useful for existing service providers to use in order to review the aspects that consumers value against the service they currently provide.

These experiences reinforced the pivotal role of principals in encouraging and facilitating teacher spiritual formation and also identified a lack of role definition for principals in this area. The importance of the spiritual formation of teachers to the authenticity and vitality of Catholic schools signalled a need to clarify the principal's leadership role in the spiritual formation of teachers in Catholic schools in the Parramatta Diocese. The case study methodology utilised different data collecting methods including individual and group interviews, survey, document analysis and observation to draw different perspectives from teachers, principals, and personnel from the Catholic Education Office, Parramatta. The research explored the range of spiritual formation experiences valued by teachers, both within structured programs and in the day-to-day experiences within schools. It identified responses of teachers to spiritual formation, the challenges in this area, and the role of principals. The research findings suggest that the principal's leadership roles in the spiritual formation of teachers apply at the every-day cultural level of school experiences for teachers, where the principal shapes and strengthens experiences of Catholic culture for teachers, and the school community; at the whole school level, where the principal has a key role in strategic planning in relation to spiritual formation, in extending individual consideration to teachers, and in nurturing teacher leadership and co-leadership; and finally, at the diocesan level, where the principal has a stewardship role with other principals in relation to the long term spiritual formation of teachers. At the diocesan level the principal also participates in collaborative alliances with diocesan personnel which increase opportunities for teacher spiritual formation A fundamental leadership responsibility for principals is to nurture a spiritual base to their own leadership. Support for the spiritual formation of newly appointed principals and those aspiring to the role should be a system priority and would augment initiatives currently in place for experienced principals in the diocese. The research findings point to multiple leadership roles for principals in the spiritual formation of teachers. These findings expand and elaborate the existing role description for principals in Catholic schools in the Parramatta Diocese.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School principals</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Spiritual formation programs</field><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp72.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sisters of St Joseph: the Tasmanian experience the foundation of the Sisters of St Joseph in Tasmania1887-1937</field><field name="creator">Brady, Josephine Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on and analyses the first fifty years, 1887-1937, of the Sisters of Saint Joseph&#8217;s ministry in Tasmania. The design of the study is qualitative in nature, employing ethnographic techniques with a thematic approach to the narrative. Through a multifaceted approach the main figures of the Josephite story of the first fifty years are examined. The thesis attempts to redress the imbalance of the representation of women in Australian history and the Catholic Church in particular. The thesis is that as a uniquely Australian congregation the Tasmanian Sisters of St Joseph were focused on the preservation of the original spirit and tradition articulated at their foundation rather than on the development of a unique Tasmanian identity. The thesis argues that it was the formative period that impacted on their future development and the emerging myths contributed to their search for identity. Isolated from their foundations through separation and misunderstanding, they sought security and authenticity through their conservation of the original Rule. The intervention of cofounder Father Tenison Woods in the early months of their foundation served to consolidate a distinctive loyalty to him to the exclusion of Mary MacKillop. Coupled with the influence of Woods were the Irish and intercolonial influences of significant Sisters from other foundations which militated against the emergence of a distinctive Tasmanian leadership. As a Diocesan Congregation the Tasmanian Josephites achieved status as authentic religious within Tasmania and yet were constrained by their Diocesan character. The study identifies the factors that contributed to their development as a teaching Congregation through the impact of the Teacher and Schools&#8217; Registration Act 1906, influence of government regulations on the Woods-MacKillop style of education, and the commitment of the Church to provide Catholic education in the remote areas of Tasmania. The thesis identifies two major formative periods as occurring at the instigation of Archbishops Delany and Simonds at both the foundation and then more significantly after the consolidation phase at the end of the period under examination.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sisters of Saint Joseph</field><field name="subject">Australian Catholic Church history</field><field name="subject">Tasmanian Josephites</field><field name="subject">Catholic education</field><field name="subject">Father Tenison Woods</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp73.09042006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration Of The Concept Of values-Led Principalship</field><field name="creator">Branson, Christopher Michael</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research study was to understand better and reconstruct the concept of values-led principalship. In recent times, in response to constant change and uncertainty, there has been a consistent call for a new form of principalship: values-led principalship. Principals are now being urged to allow values to shape their principalship behaviour. In short, values-led behaviour is said to afford the principal the means of providing appropriate school leadership in unpredictable, and even ambiguous, times. However, the assertion that values can play a positive role in a principal&#8217;s performance needs to be substantiated. Despite their innate appeal, the nature and function of values in human endeavours remains somewhat unclear. This research study seeks to redress this lack of understanding by investigating how knowing personal values might help the principal to be led by these values and, thereby, be able to act more effectively as an educational leader. To this end, this research study is situated within the research paradigm of pragmatic constructivism and informed by the theoretical perspective of symbolic interactionism. The orchestrating perspective was case study with the boundaries of the case defined in terms of the system of secondary schools operating under the auspices of the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane. This case study included an open-ended questionnaire, two closed questionnaires, and a series of three semi-structured interviews with five principals. This research study began with a comprehensive review of literature from psychology, ethics and values theory to establish the relationship between values and behaviour. This review highlighted five important insights in respect to personal values. First, personal values are formed during the general experiences of life. Second, these personal values influence behaviour. Third, personal values are subjective inner-world phenomena that are more likely to be tacit and subliminal influences upon one&#8217;s behaviour. Fourth, having knowledge of one&#8217;s own personal values is not a natural or a common occurrence and the gaining of this particular form of self-knowledge is difficult and requires effort and appropriate processes. Finally, the appropriate process for gaining self-knowledge of one&#8217;s personal values is through self-reflection and introspection. Based on these insights, the researcher identified four research questions: How knowledgeable are the principals of their own personal values? How have the personal values of the principals been formed? Can a principal gain increased self-knowledge of his or her personal values and the relationship of these personal values to his or her educational leadership behaviour? Does an increased level of self-knowledge of personal values bring about values-led principalship? In general, the findings of this research study suggest that values-led principalship is a simplistic conceptualisation that does not reflect the complex relationships between the inner Self and behaviour. The concept of values-led principalship assumes self-knowledge of personal values and the deliberate application of this knowledge to influence personal behaviour. By not considering the formation of personal values and the inner antecedents of personal values within the Self, any self-knowledge of one&#8217;s personal values remains notional. Notional self-knowledge maintains the tacit, subliminal influence of personal values on behaviour. Thus, personal values are directing or driving behaviour resulting in values driven rather than values-led principalship. From an instrumental perspective, this finding raises a number of issues in respect to the professional development of principals. As a consequence, the following propositions are advanced: The professional development of principals should prepare them to incorporate regular self-reflective and introspective practices; The professional development of principals should challenge them to develop a rich knowledge of their inner Self; The professional development of principals should assist them to appreciate how their whole life experience is woven into their leadership behaviour; and Contemporary principals require formal professional mentoring programmes to assist them to more truly clarify and understand the antecedents of their leadership behaviours.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School principals</field><field name="subject">Values-led principalship</field><field name="subject">Self-knowledge</field><field name="subject">Personal values</field><field name="subject">Educational leadership behaviour</field><field name="subject">Principal performance</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp64.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Attachment in a Time-limited Marital Therapy: Implications for practice and treatment</field><field name="creator">Coral Brown</field><field name="description">The present study investigates the role of attachment in a time-limited marital therapy. The study explores Brief Contextual Modular Psychotherapy (BCMT). This approach to practice provides a model that integrates principles and techniques from the major psychotherapies. BCMT can be distinguished from other brief therapies by its theoretical integration, its six-session time limit, its specific clinical focus, and its techniques for dealing with dissatisfaction and distress. The therapy sets out practice modules&#8212;six-session treatment plans&#8212;for a diverse range of presenting issues such as the anxiety disorders, depression, trauma, loss and grief, marriage and the phobias. BCMT emphasises the collaboration of the therapist and the client. A community-based psychological counselling centre has practised BCMT for over ten years, applying it in cases of wide diversity and maladjustment. Prior to this research, a comprehensive analysis of the theory underlying the BCMT model or the theory of change it endorses had not been carried out. The study provides a detailed description of the conceptual and treatment elements of the marital module developed in the treatment manual for BCMT. The study explores how the construct of attachment provides an organising framework or metaperspective for theory construction and therapeutic intervention in the clinical application of this time-limited marital therapy. To achieve this objective, one de-facto and four married couples participated in the time-limited therapy. They completed a questionnaire on adult attachment and also a self-report questionnaire to assess the effectiveness of the therapy. Narrative analysis was used to assess the praxis or the experience of participating in the therapy. The results show that the integrated model provided a treatment method for differing expressions of marital disturbance and psychopathology. Three of the five couples and eight of the ten participants reported positive treatment outcomes. The research sample included the paraphilias, a major depressive episode with postpartum psychosis, the narcissistic borderline syndrome and childhood sexual abuse. The study supports the association between the role of adult attachment styles and intrapsychic responses in conflicted intimate relationships. From the point of view of clinical applications of attachment theory, the research highlights how theoretical ideas can be integrated, specific clinical methods can be incorporated and certain treatment perspectives can be derived from one another. Several implications for the treatment process flow from this integration. The integration of attachment theory in BCMT demonstrates how the therapeutic process progressed through three separate yet interrelated stages: past, present and future. In addition, it led to the identification of three stage-related mourning processes associated with the time-limited therapeutic process: protest, despair and detachment. From a clinical perspective, the research finds that the theoretical and treatment model does not need to be restricted to marital therapy. The findings suggest that the integrated model could be applied across a wide range of presenting issues. By defining the theory of personality and psychopathology and the therapeutic change processes associated with it, the integration of attachment theory results in BCMT taking its place in the literature as a theory of psychotherapy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brief Contextual Modular Psychotherapy</field><field name="subject">BCMT</field><field name="subject">Time-limited marital therapy</field><field name="subject">Attachment</field><field name="subject">Therapeutic intervention</field><field name="subject">Theory construction</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp14.25072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of Curriculum Change: An analysis of religious education coordinators&#8217; perspectives on the management of a particular curriculum change in Catholic secondary schools in the Archdiocese of Melbourne</field><field name="creator">Buchanan, Michael T</field><field name="description">This thesis aimed to study the perspectives of religious education coordinators&#8217; in secondary schools in the Archdiocese of Melbourne regarding their management of a particular curriculum change in religious education. The change in question involved a &#8220;top down&#8221; (Morris, 1995) change to a &#8220;text-based curriculum&#8221; (Pell, 2001) directed by the Archbishop of Melbourne, who is responsible for religious education in Catholic schools throughout the Archdiocese. Situated within a qualitative paradigm this research utilised grounded theory as a means to identify and analyse the theory generated from interviews with religious education coordinators who were responsible for managing the change. The emergent categories were used to generate new theory in relation to how religious education coordinators managed the curriculum change. Key theories generated from this study included factors that impeded the change such as an inability to understand the theoretical position underpinning the curriculum innovation, and inadequate qualifications to teach religious education. It also generated theory about factors that assisted the management of this change such as time to reflect on practice, and support from school leadership teams. The theory generated was analysed against the existing knowledge about curriculum change in education, textbook use and leadership in religious education. A distinguishing aspect of this research is that it linked the general literature on educational change as it applies to curriculum change, with curriculum change in religious education.The study also proposed some recommendations for future directions and practices concerning the management of curriculum change in religious education in Catholic schools.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religious education</field><field name="subject">Catholic secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Archdiocese of Melbourne</field><field name="subject">Curriculum change</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp131.17052007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiences and Influences of Women Directors</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Zena</field><field name="description">The present research provides the first analyses of Australian women directors from the perspective of social identity theory. The overall objective of the research program is to confirm the validity of social identity theory to the study of women on corporate boards and in doing so, add to the limited knowledge regarding successful women directors. An aim of the research was to identify factors that are significant in the social identity of women who are successful directors of corporate boards. These factors were revealed through a longitudinal study (over six years) of changes in the demographic characteristics of the women and their board positions. Factors were revealed through their perceptions of their effectiveness as an ostensibly minority (female) board member. Similarities in stereotyped attitudes to men and women board directors confirmed their status as an ingroup member. Through identification of significant factors in women&#8217;s success as board directors it is hoped to assist both individual women who are striving for success on corporate boards and organisations who wish to make more effective use of women on their boards.  Five studies examined various aspects of women directors&#8217; experiences and influences through three survey instruments that were used to collect data over a period of six years. A survey design allowed the gathering of detailed data on a variety of items thought to be relevant to women&#8217;s experiences of being directors and allowed the data collected to be oriented to a theoretical framework. Thus, a survey design was deemed superior to common alternatives of analysis of archival company annual report data or re-analysis of data collected by executive search companies for a study of corporate directors.  A survey of 572 Australian women directors in 1995 identified many characteristics of women directors. A profile of a typical Australian women director was constructed and compared to international research on women directors covering a similar period (e.g., Burke, 1994b; Catalyst, 1993; Holton, Rabbets &amp; Scrivener, 1993). An examination of differences between the characteristics of executive and nonexecutive women directors confirmed that the two director roles could be perceived as distinct groups. A further survey of the women six years later examined changes in their characteristics and board experiences. Of the 298 women who had agreed to follow-up research, 59 surveys were returned as no longer at the same address, 23 women indicated that they were no longer on a corporate board, and 32 were current corporate directors. Changes in the women&#8217;s profiles that the directors had attained through increased board memberships and more central board roles were interpreted as indicators of success. Based on research by Cejka and Eagly (1999), similarities and differences in stereotypical attitudes of men and women directors were examined in relation to social identity theory. Factors in nonexecutive women directors&#8217; identification as board directors, their perceptions of their ability to contribute as board directors, and their behaviour as a board directors were assessed by measures from Karasawa (1991) and Westphal and Milton (2000).  The present research program demonstrated the value of social identity theory as a vehicle for understanding Australian women director&#8217;s experiences on corporate boards. For the present research, social identity theory provided insights into how successful Australian women directors perceive themselves and other members of their ingroup of board directors.  By contributing to a deeper understanding of successful women directors, it is hoped that a greater number of women will be able to successfully join ingroups of board directors, thereby breaking down the barriers to women.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Board directors</field><field name="subject">Non-executive women directors</field><field name="subject">Australian women directors</field><field name="subject">Social identity theory</field><field name="subject">Longitudinal study</field><field name="subject">Demographic characteristics</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp30.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sacred or Profane: The Influence of Vatican Legislation on Music in the Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne, 1843 - 1938</field><field name="creator">Byrne, John Henry</field><field name="description">Despite the authoritative and very explicit directions from the Vatican in 1903, the Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne successfully resisted the demands for a major reform of liturgical Church music for 35 years. This thesis will examine the reasons for this strong and effective resistance to the demands of the Holy See and show that despite being complex and interrelated these reasons can be summarised under two fundamental headings. The thesis will examine the broad spectrum of music performed in the Melbourne Archdiocese, but because of the limited availability of information and the prime importance of the two principal churches of the Archdiocese, it shall concentrate on St. Patrick&#8217;s Cathedral and on St. Francis Church. The thesis shall also examine in detail the documents of the Holy See concerning liturgical music which were relevant to musical practice in Melbourne. Special attention is drawn to the influential Motu proprio Tra le sollecitudini (1903) issued by Pope Pius X. The time span of this thesis covers the 95 years from March 1843 when the first music was sung in Melbourne&#8217;s only Catholic church to 1938 when Archbishop Daniel Mannix ordered the reforms to liturgical music as demanded by the Vatican. The thesis shall demonstrate that the resistance to the reform of liturgical music in the Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne was due to the two following influences: the fact that the new freedom and wealth that the immigrant Irish community of the Archdiocese of Melbourne experienced enabled them to establish churches and liturgies whose grandeur and artistic excellence symbolized their success in establishing a major new social and cultural status in their new home. Church music was one of the great manifestations of this and as an integral part of their new significance and sense of achievement, it was to be jealously guarded. the second was the matter of authority and the independence of the Catholic bishops from the dictates and interference of the Vatican authorities. These Irish-born bishops were trained in an historical milieu in Ireland and Europe which fostered a fierce pride in the value of autonomy from external and alien authority. In this they were given a great degree of protection by the isolation of Australia and its distance from outside authority. In this Archbishops Carr and Mannix both proved to be strongly independent leaders who proved to be most reluctant to automatically implement reforms imposed by the Vatican. It will be shown that only in the fourth decade of the twentieth century was Episcopal authority finally brought to bear to make reforms to liturgical music a reality in the Catholic Church in Melbourne.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liturgical music</field><field name="subject">Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne</field><field name="subject">Liturgical music reform</field><field name="subject">St Patrick&#8217;s Cathedral</field><field name="subject">St Francis Church</field><field name="subject">Music practice</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp09042006.88</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of Reading Intervention Programs in a Junior Secondary School Setting</field><field name="creator">Callery, Catherine Florence</field><field name="description">This study investigates key factors contributing to literacy development of underachieving readers in a junior secondary school. Two intervention programs designed to enhance the reading skills of eight underachieving readers in a junior secondary school were used. These eight individuals, of normal intelligence, had in common a history of reading difficulties. In the first of these programs eight students participated in a one-on-one reading intervention program using an adaptation of the program Making A Difference (Ministry of Education and Training, Victoria, 1992). In the second program four students from the above-mentioned cohort participated in a one-to-four intervention program involving the use of a Meta Language Awareness Program involving, among other things, Reciprocal Teaching (Palinscar and Brown 1985) procedures. The underlying premise to this study is that underachieving readers are characteristically non-strategic and that through two explicit methods of instruction used they can improve their reading. A key to helping the participants break the cycle of failure in reading is to help them make the connection between effort in the use of particular reading strategies and success in the reading process. This study reveals that struggling adolescent readers have many reasons for their difficulties with reading and require different approaches to the process of reading. However, with teacher persistence in appropriate conditions, and tailoring reading experiences to meet student needs, such individuals can become successful, engaged readers who enjoy reading. A detailed analysis of one case, &#8216;Sarah,&#8217; is presented since &#8220;it can provide insight into the class of events from which the case has been drawn&#8221; (Burns, 1995, p. 320). Evidence measured in tests and anecdotal records illustrate general findings about Sarah and the other seven participants. Themes related to the participants&#8217; ultimate success in reading are elaborated in this thesis, not because they are thought to be unique but because they will most likely be recognisable to other teachers of struggling adolescent readers.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="subject">Reading intervention programs</field><field name="subject">Secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp75.29082006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical Intent: Imagining the drug using client and the human service worker in harm minimisation policy</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Lea</field><field name="description">This thesis is based on an Australian Research Council funded research grant. Fifty-one qualitative interviews were conducted with human service workers to gain an understanding of their interpretations of their clients&#8217; &#8216;drug problems&#8217; and of their own role, the service system and wider policies. Although harm minimisation has been Australia&#8217;s official drug policy since 1985, little is known about how harm minimisation is &#8216;enacted&#8217; in the helping culture. To date human service workers have not been recognised in their constitutive role in harm minimisation discourse. Whilst a significant part of drug policy interventions are delivered via human services, the helping subject has not come under scrutiny. The drug using subject remains ill-conceived as a result of neglecting its partnering others or indeed its overlapping with other subject positions. Moving beyond recognising workers only in terms of staff opinions and attitudes, a relational and multi-level approach is adopted to introduce more complexity into the debate. After a brief historic discussion of the creation of the &#8216;human service worker&#8217; and the &#8216;drug user&#8217; (as client) and methodological considerations about discourse analysis, the thesis proceeds with the introduction of a conceptual framework consisting of four levels: the individual, relational, institutional and cultural political economic level. These levels are used to examine the existing literature on &#8216;drug problem factories&#8217; and for the analysis of the data. By focusing on these levels the critical analysis of the interview material shows that &#8216;harm&#8217; and &#8216;minimising&#8217; are themselves contested categories and that different harms and different harm producing and minimising practices can be identified some of which have come into discourse, others are excluded or entirely absent. The human service workers struggle to make sense of their own role and to define how drug users are being &#8216;helped&#8217; and could or should be helped. Their understanding of harm minimisation discourse aligns with, supports and/or resists other discourses such as (neo)liberalism, neoconservatism, prohibition and economic rationalism. The workers are portrayed as having substituted increasing complexity for initial simplicity in the course of working with &#8216;drug users&#8217;. In summary, this thesis offers a poststructuralist analysis of how harm minimisation is constituted, negotiated and undermined from the perspective of human service workers and shows how the service systems&#8217; helping cultures enrol human service workers in harm producing and harm minimising practices. Harm minimisation consists of discursive and non-discursive elements and is a product of deliberate social forces as well as messy contingencies and unintended consequences.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug users</field><field name="subject">Human service workers</field><field name="subject">Harm minimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp172.09092008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Redesigning the Principalship in Catholic Schools</field><field name="creator">Cannon, Helen Mary</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to determine how the role of the principal in the Catholic school could be redesigned so that more quality applicants are prepared to seek principalship and principals already in the role could be retained. The catalyst for this study derived from the shortage of suitable applicants for the position of principal, a problem that exists not only in Australia, but also in many Western countries. An exploratory mixed method design was chosen for the study with the data gathering divided into two phases. The first phase was the qualitative phase during which the data were gathered using focus group interviews and analysed using QSR N6. The second phase was the quantitative phase, where the data were collected using a survey constructed from the data gathered and analysed in the first phase. This research project asked the question, how can the principalship be redesigned to attract more quality applicants to the role and retain incumbents already in the role? The research revealed that, to answer the question a fundamental rethinking of the principalship is necessary and that such momentous change requires nothing less than a paradigm shift. The new paradigm would be based on sharing leadership rather than on an hierarchical approach. It would have structures that are flexible and customised to the local needs of the school and school community. Learning would be central and a work/life balance would be essential, for all principals. The new paradigm would also offer enough flexibility to encourage women to both take up, and remain in, principalship. The findings from this research led to the development of nine propositions, which, it is suggested, should inform and influence the new paradigm of principalship. Together with the recommendations, they provide a scaffold and a guide to action for redesigning the principalship.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Catholic school principals</field><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">Principalship</field><field name="subject">Job design</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp76.09042006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imagination For Better Not Worse: The Hobbit in the primary classroom</field><field name="creator">Carroll, Maureen</field><field name="description">This thesis argues for the power of story and, in particular, the story of The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien to help build optimism and hope. The Hobbit is under-used in primary schools and this thesis demonstrates that it is eminently suitable for children. Without imagination children are vulnerable to sadness and despair. The positive development of imagination through heroic tales is likely to benefit children emotionally and psychologically. The story of The Hobbit can be utilised to develop the concept of the Hero's Journey, a persistent trope in oral and recorded literature and an archetype for virtually all human experience. In addition, the thesis shows that critical thinking skills and multiple intelligences can be developed through the use of The Hobbit. Depression in young people is now recognised as a serious public health problem in Australia. Research supports the view that children need optimism. This thesis discusses statistics regarding the increased prevalence of childhood depression and aggression as well as alarming youth suicide reports. The inquiry by the Victorian Parliament into the effects of television violence on children is examined and the scholarly works of Neil Postman, inter alia, are discussed to establish the overall pattern of positive association between television violence and aggression in children. Furthermore, the contention that many contemporary realistic texts do little to promote hopefulness in the young is supported with the opinions of scholars who are respected in the field of children&#8217;s literature. Tolkien was a devout Catholic but, even more importantly, he was able to restate traditional values through his imaginative works of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. This has relevance for Catholic educators who strive to relate Gospel values to popular culture. Christian education must extend imagination beyond morality to help young people to find meaning and purpose in their lives. Through the use of The Hobbit and other books of this kind, children can begin to learn not to fear change, failure or setbacks but to see them as important challenges and opportunities for personal growth.

This diversity is being witnessed in Catholic schools. This thesis reports research which employed quantitative data collection methods in investigating students&#8217; perceptions of their multicultural classroom environment. By drawing on Catholic school literature, multicultural literature, previous learning environment research and the perceptions of stakeholders, an instrument, known as the Multicultural Classroom Environment Instrument (MCEI), was developed to assess psychosocial dimensions of classroom environments in Queensland Catholic secondary schools. These dimensions were: Collaboration, Competition, Teacher Authority, Teacher Support, Congruence, Deference, Teacher Directedness and Gender Equity. The use of the instrument with a sample of 1,460 students in 24 Catholic secondary schools in Queensland revealed some statistically significant differences in students&#8217; perceptions of their classroom environment. Differences were revealed according to the country of birth of the student and those of the parents. Investigations examining school type, subject, year level and gender were also undertaken. Single-sex schools were shown to be more concerned with Teacher Authority and Competition compared to coeducational schools. Religion and Study of Religion classes were perceived as very similar, irrespective of school type. There were differences in students&#8217; perception of the classroom environment across different year levels, with year 8 students&#8217; perceptions significantly different to that of years 10 and 12 students. Girls generally perceived their classroom environment more positively than boys, with greater Collaboration, Teacher Support and Gender Equity and less Competition and Teacher Authority. The results of this thesis suggest that differences in students&#8217; perceptions of multicultural classroom environments in Queensland Catholic secondary schools do exist. It also suggests that in order to continue to provide quality education, Catholic schools must acknowledge these differences. They must also ensure that curriculum initiatives, staff professional development and training, and other educational and pastoral initiatives are designed to incorporate the differences identified in this thesis. Further investigation into a variety of multicultural classroom environments is recommended.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Multicultural classroom</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp119.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biblical Metaphors for God in the Primary Level of the Religious Education Series To Know Worship And Love</field><field name="creator">Carswell, Margaret F</field><field name="description">To Know Worship and Love is the religious instruction curriculum produced and mandated for use by the Archdiocese of Melbourne. The primary series comprises a Teaching Companion and Student Text for every level of education, Preparatory to Year 6. This study undertakes examination of the series to determine if biblical metaphors for God which contain a physical vehicle are used and presented within it in accord with the accepted exegetical practices of the Church. The study begins by examining Church documents that pertain to both religious instruction and Scripture to determine a set of principles which should guide the use of Scripture. Notable among the six principles elucidated is the expectation that the use of Scripture should reflect accepted exegetical practices of the Church. These are defined as those which enable a clear understanding of the literal sense of Scripture, as ascertained through use of the Historical-Critical method. In order to come to a sound understanding of the literal sense of metaphors, the study reviews how they work and what results from their use. Such a review is important for two reasons. First, in the finding that metaphors for God prompt the formation of a concept of God, the need for their valid interpretation in religious instruction is stressed. Second, it enables the articulation of eight specific requirements for the interpretation of biblical metaphors for God. Subsequent examination of the series against what is required reveals that of the eight requirements, only one is provided within the series. No unit or activity identifies the sixty-three biblical metaphors cited in the series and no unit teaches students how they work to communicate meaning. No unit provides information of the vehicles used within their historical setting and no unit explains the historical circumstances which gave rise to the dominance of certain metaphors. In order to explain why biblical metaphors for God are presented so poorly in To Know Worship and Love, the use of Scripture generally in the series is examined against the six principles drawn from Church documents. The finding that the series does not observe the principles which should guide the use of Scripture, in particular, the finding that the series does not use accepted exegetical practices of the Church, provides significant insight into the inadequate presentation of metaphors. The study concludes by making three recommendations. First, it recommends that a process of rewriting To Know Worship and Love must be undertaken immediately. Second, it recommends that the use and placement of Scripture in religious instruction programmes in the future adhere to the six principles of the Church outlined in this study. Third, it recommends that the clear and accurate teaching of what metaphors and how they work be made a priority in religious instruction programmes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religious Education</field><field name="subject">God</field><field name="subject">Scripture</field><field name="subject">Biblical exegesis</field><field name="subject">Biblical metaphors</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp137.17052007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From the Sacred Heart to the Heart of the Sacred: the Spiritual Journey of Australian Catholics Since the Second Vatican Council</field><field name="creator">Cashen, Paul William Dillon</field><field name="description">This study was undertaken to investigate and to propose a solution to the pastoral dilemma that faced the Catholic Church in Australia the 1990&#8217;s. The pastoral dilemma contrasted two opposing pastoral responses to the significant changes in Catholic life since the Second Vatican Council. One response reacted to the changes by interpreting them as &#8220;crises of faith&#8221;. This response determined that the decline in mass attendance, the fewer vocations to the priesthood and religious life and the disregard of the teaching authority of the Church was the result of a loss of faith. Consequently, it prescribed a return to previous values and behaviour. The other response was more difficult to determine and has been the principle work of this thesis. The second pastoral response was identified in the search for the sacred in the daily lives of the people. This search linked the changes in Catholic life to the ongoing journey of faith that has taken place. A pastoral response based on this understanding of the changes in Catholic life was seen to provide an opportunity for &#8220;all who invoked the name of Christ&#8221; to enter a deeper relationship with him and each other. This response embraced the spirit of renewal proposed by the Council. A review of religious literature published in Australia since the Council was conducted to provide an overview of the journey of Catholic life. It identified four categories of literature that displayed the most interest in the changes. Whilst the review had a particular focus on Catholics, it included other traditions. Of the four categories initially sociology of religion which attracted most interest, followed later by theological reflections and interpretations, and ultimately an interest in spirituality, or the &#8220;spirituality revolution&#8221;. The historical and biographical studies reviewed recounted the changes in Church life and remained at a lesser, but constant expression of interest. An examination of the research of sociology of religion in Australia established that the changes in religious belief and practice were influenced by environmental factors and, for Catholics, the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. The methods of sociology identified the significant areas of change, but their limited explanations of the changes did little to assist church authorities to resolve the tensions and difficulties. The limitations of statistical information about religion contributed to the pastoral dilemma. The findings of sociology increased interest in theological reflection about the influence of the changing context of society on Catholic life. These reflections endeavoured to explain the reforms of the Council, the relationship to the changes to the reforms and led to &#8220;contextual&#8221;  theology which was embraced by the &#8220;Discovery of an Australian Theology&#8221;. Spirituality by the 1990s had become a popular response that purported to take the place of &#8220;organised religion&#8221; in the community. The interest in spirituality also became the key factor in the Catholic search for deeper values, and inspired a renewed sense of the spiritual in ordinary everyday life. The popular interest in spirituality was located in the tradition of Christian spirituality, and the thesis concluded that this tradition embraced the personal experience of God, as expressed in the lives of Catholics in Australia. Such personal experiences were identified and discerned to benefit of the individual and through dialogue transformed the community. The transformation, thus begun, continued in further dialogue, engaged the community, and inspired others beyond the community of the Church to believe. Therefore, the personal experience of the spiritual was authenticated by its place in the developing tradition of the Church. The Council called for individuals and communities in the Church to identify the &#8220;signs of the times&#8221; as the opportunities for renewal, and personal renewal was closely linked to communal renewal. The &#8220;search for a soul&#8221; expressed an Australian &#8220;sign of the times&#8221;. The search provided the opportunity for many people to embark on a journey that led to personal and communal renewal or transformation. Consequently, pastoral responses to renewal based on rule and regulation, or expectations of the past, lacked the personal spiritual dimension. Thus, the title of the thesis figuratively describes the spiritual journey of Catholics from a devotional religious experience to one that seeks to find the sacred in the core values and experiences of life.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Second Vatican Council</field><field name="subject">Australian Catholic Church</field><field name="subject">Catholic life</field><field name="subject">Faith</field><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp93.29052006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cooperative Learning, Multiple Intelligences and Proficiency: application in college English language teaching and learning</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shu-Fen</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to investigate whether the implementation of Cooperative Learning (CL) activities, incorporating the insights given by Howard Gardner&#8217; (1993) theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI) and the notion of Whole Language Approach (WLA) in college EFL classrooms will have a positive effect on students&#8217; language proficiency and attitude. A quasi-experimental study was developed. The site of this study was in an EFL classroom in a Taiwanese College. The subjects were from the researcher&#8217;s three English classes at Chung Hwa Institute of Medical Technology during one semester. Many learning activities based on Gardner&#8217;s theory of Multiple Intelligences were used while a Cooperative Learning approach was practiced. The data for this study was collected from three sources. One was from the subjects&#8217; questionnaires on attitudes and on motivation, regarding Cooperative Learning and Multiple Intelligences. Another was from student interviews. The third was from the students&#8217; test scores on their language proficiency tests. The results of the study showed that the experimental group that was taught using the ideas based on CL and MI outperformed the group based on CL, and the control group, on the Simulate English General Proficiency tests for the four language skills. Though there were no significant differences among them within this short-time study, the motivation in learning English was enhanced a great deal for the experimental group that was taught using the CL and MI ideas. Based upon the insight gained from this study, CL, MI, WLA and Language Learning Center were thus recommended to be integrated into the Junior College English curriculum. Pedagogical implications for the application of CL and MI in an EFL classroom were developed. Above all, suggestions for teacher development in CL and MI were proposed. Finally, suggestions for future research have been recommended.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cooperative learning</field><field name="subject">Taiwanese education</field><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">English language learning</field><field name="subject">Multiple intelligence theory</field><field name="subject">Whole Language Approach</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp120.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Graphic Organizers on Taiwanese Tertiary Students' EFL Reading Comprehension and Attitudes Towards Reading in English</field><field name="creator">Chiang, Chiu-ling</field><field name="description">The present study was a one sample pre- and post-session, quasi experimental design, conducted during an intensive English course in 2003 in Taiwan. Participants were fifty tertiary level freshmen from a medical college in Southern Taiwan. In order to understand the effects of graphic organizers on participants' EFL, reading comprehension and attitudes towards reading in English, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered. Research has shown that the graphic organizer is effective in facilitating reading comprehension and learning attitudes when students construct their own graphic organizers cooperatively in group-work in the post-reading session. The purpose of the present study was three-fold. First, the study investigated the effects of two different types of graphic organizer strategies, teacher- and student-generated on Taiwanese TVES (Technological and Vocational Education System) tertiary freshmen's EFL reading comprehension achievement. Secondly, the study explored participants' attitudes towards EFL reading after the use of the two types of organizer strategies. Thirdly, the study examined the participants' attitudes towards the use of the two types of organizer strategies. The study was conducted in two stages. During the first stage, the teacher-generated graphic organizer strategy was employed. In the second stage, participants generated graphic organizers in a group-work setting. Two comprehension tests generated by the researcher as a pre- and post-test were administered. Following analysis of the qualitative and quantitative data three important conclusions can be made. First, the student-generated graphic organizer strategy had significantly positive impact on the students' reading comprehension. I-Iowever, the ceiling effect of language proficiency inhibited low-scorers' comprehension performance. Secondly, the use of student-generated graphic organizers in a group-work setting had a significantly positive impact on students' attitudes towards EFL reading, particularly those of the low-scorers. Thirdly, students' attitudes towards the use of two graphic organizer strategies did not show any significant differences. Although these conclusions are based on a small sample, the findings of this study suggest that the use of graphic organizers is an effective pedagogical tool for promoting EFL, reading comprehension and improving attitudes toward EFL reading, particularly when students generate their graphic organizers cooperatively, Key words: EFL reading, tertiary students, graphic organizers, reading comprehension, attitudes towards reading.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reading comprehension</field><field name="subject">English language acquisition</field><field name="subject">Graphic organisers</field><field name="subject">Reading in English</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp77.29082006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring Student and Teacher Interactions for Critical Thinking in Face-to-Face and Online Environments in an EFL Course in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Yi-Ching Jean</field><field name="description">Current literature indicates a lack of exploration of factors relating to Taiwanese students&#8217; critical thinking in the field of English as a Foreign Language (EFL). The research study was a case study based on the social constructivist framework. The aim of this study was to explore how teacher and students interactions online impacted critical thinking by addressing the social norm in Confucius Heritage Culture (CHC). The characteristics of the social norm of CHC do not readily support verbalizing thoughts and challenging others face-to-face in public, which are important to the practice of critical thinking. The research was conducted in an English-major reading class at a university in Taiwan. The data collection methods included focus groups, collaborative inquiry with the teacher, and the researcher&#8217;s participant observation in both face-to-face and online discussions. The findings suggested that students need teacher&#8217;s cognitive, affective, pedagogical and technical support and face-to-face small group support before engaging in online interactions. Modified debates in new face-to-face models of interaction helped maximise the social constructivist approach with the teacher&#8217;s shepherd facilitation. The online interaction patterns in a CHC context underwent a three-phase process, which described how CHC students externalised critical thinking within groups, inter-groups and inter-classes in online form.

This research is a case study conducted in the framework of a qualitative approach using ethnographic methods, including fieldwork methods with data triangulation through participant observation, individual interviews and focus group interviews. Grounded theory was used to analyse data collected. The particular group of young people were Chinese in race, and Australian born, or had been living in Australia since early childhood. They attended the English speaking fellowship and services of a Chinese evangelical church in Melbourne, and their ages were between fifteen and eighteen years. They were born or had grown up in Australia, and had been exposed at least to two cultures, the Australian culture in the society, and the Chinese traditional culture in their family, in which the parents were the first generation in Australia. This research aimed to find out the characteristics of the spirituality of the Chinese young people through acknowledging the multicultural context in which they lived. Thus, it began with a cultural perspective and sought to study the cultural contexts that account for their distinctive Christian spirituality. In summary, the research reported in this thesis describes the young participants&#8217; spirituality from their own perspectives, discusses their construction of identity that led to their distinctive spirituality, and studies their parents&#8217; worldviews and the role of cultural institutions that have affected their spirituality. Finally, it concludes with development of theories of spirituality related to Chinese young people in a multicultural society, and proposes ways in which churches and families may encourage the development of spirituality for Chinese young people in a multicultural society.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Chinese in Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp121.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of the Developing Ecclesiology of the Assemblies of God in Australia</field><field name="creator">Clifton, Shane Jack</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to describe, analyse and assess the developing ecclesiology of the Assemblies of God in Australia (AGA). In chapter one, after reviewing the sparse literature on pentecostal ecclesiology, we turn to a contemplation of ecclesiological method. We note that some of the typical approaches, including biblicist and communio ecclesiologies, are idealist in orientation, since they contemplate the church in abstraction from its concrete, socio-historical and cultural identity. In chapter two we develop an alternative method, building particularly on the insights of Joseph Komonchak and Neil Ormerod, who argue that the object of ecclesiology is not ecclesial ideals but, rather, the set (or sets) of experiences, understandings, symbols, words, judgements, statements, decisions, actions, relationships, and institutions which distinguish the group of people called &#8220;the Church.&#8221; This leads to a concrete methodology that is derived from the explicit and implicit ecclesiology apparent in the history of the church. It also recognises that the church is a social reality as well as a divinely ordained community and, therefore, that the ecclesiologist needs to incorporate the insights of both the disciplines of theology and sociology. A large part of our discussion in chapter two is thus concerned with the nature of the interaction between these various disciplines.The method outlined in these early chapters forms the basis of our exploration of the ecclesiology of the AGA in chapters three to five. In line with our methodological construction, each chapter begins with the narrative of particular periods in the movement&#8217;s history, focusing especially on times of ecclesial transition and development. These narrative sections not only tell a story that has, largely, remained untold, but they also seek to draw out the explicit and implicit elements of AGA ecclesiology. In each chapter, narrative is followed by analysis which, firstly, clarifies central aspects of the developing ecclesiology and, secondly, attempts to assess what has been gained and lost in the process of ecclesiological change. With regard to the content of these chapters, chapter three treats the development of early pentecostalism, and the transition from unstructured and loosely knit faith mission communities to congregationally structured churches. Chapter four analyses the institutional formation of Australian pentecostalism, focusing particularly on the formalisation of the AGA. Of concern during this period was the relationship between churches and centralised bodies, as well as the roles and responsibilities of church leadership. Chapter five then treats the developments in AGA ecclesiology that accompanied the charismatic revival of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, as well as the institutional changes that occurred due to the rapid growth of the movement. In the concluding chapter six, we summarise our research, and intimate potential trajectories for the AGA as it moves into the twenty first century. In the light of our analysis and assessment, we also make some suggestions for ecclesial self-reflection.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Assemblies of God in Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian pentecostalism</field><field name="subject">Ecclesiological method</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp78.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination of Student Meaning-Making in the Post-Compulsory Subject of Study of Religion</field><field name="creator">Craig, Mark Gerard</field><field name="description">Current research and anecdotal evidence has suggested that students enrolled in the QSA (Queensland Studies Authority) subject for Year 11 and Year 12, Study of Religion, as outlined in the Senior Syllabus for Study of Religion, are experiencing difficulties in meaning-making. This may be due to particular methodologies being employed to teach the subject to secondary students (Barnes, 2001; Flood, 1999; Kay, 1997). The purpose of this research was to explore the connection between student difficulty in meaning making in Study of Religion and the employment of phenomenological methodologies as a pedagogical tool for teaching Study of Religion. It was anticipated that this study would illuminate the nature of the relationship between these two variables and provide a framework for the consideration of possible changes to current methodologies being employed in the Study of Religion classroom. The researcher adopted a case-study approach and further utilized the research methods of a survey questionnaire and a focus group to collect data. A cross-sectional survey at a Catholic co-educational College was completed. Forty-five students from a Study of Religion cohort totalling ninety were surveyed at this College. This was followed up by a focus group discussion involving five of the original forty-five students surveyed. The participants furnished a range of valuable insights in regard to the connection between student difficulty in meaning-making and the employment of largely phenomenological methodologies in teaching Study of Religion. Data analysis revealed that students enrolled in Study of Religion in Year 12 are struggling to construct meaning when phenomenological methodologies are predominantly employed. This is arguably a result of phenomenological methodologies having their provenance within a modernist paradigm. Consequently, methodologies that once assisted students to make meaning effectively in a modern context are unable to continue to do so in a post-modern context. This may be due to paradigmatic shifts in Education, Philosophy and Religious Studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religion  studies</field><field name="subject">Teaching methodologies</field><field name="subject">Catholic education</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp111.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Most Divine Of All Arts: Neoplatonism, Anglo-Catholicism and Music in the Published Writings of A E H Nickson</field><field name="creator">Crichton, Ian Kieran</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the life and thought of the influential Melbourne organist, teacher and music critic, Arthur Ernest Howard Nickson (1876-1964). Born in Melbourne, Nickson studied in England on the Clarke Scholarship at the Royal College of Music (1895-1899). During his studies in England, Nickson experienced the Catholic revival in the Church of England at its height. On his return to Australia in 1901 Nickson&#8217;s activities as a church musician, and later, as a teacher provided the platform for him to articulate views that were formed as a result of these influences. Beginning in 1904, Nickson&#8217;s 56-year career as a lecturer at the University Of Melbourne Conservatorium Of Music is important, as every student had to pass through his lectures at some point in their course. As music critic at the Age from 1927, Nickson played a decisive role in shaping public taste at the time of the establishment of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under Bernard Heinze, who was also Ormond Professor of Music at the University of Melbourne (1926-57).  Nickson&#8217;s essays form a distinct group of writings that are probably unique in Australia. The main published essays cover a forty-year period beginning in 1905, and show the development of Nickson&#8217;s thinking about the moral basis and spiritual nature of music, his views on the nature of the Church, and his worldview, based on Neoplatonic philosophy, which shaped his thinking about the process of creation. While Nickson&#8217;s view of the created order was shaped by Neoplatonic influences, his view of the redemptive function of art was expressed in terms of sacramental theology, and was related very closely to his Anglo-Catholicism. In his essays and lectures Nickson frequently worked with an abstracted concept of &#8216;Art&#8217;, rather than specific art objects. While reference was made to art objects, it is not clear how Nickson defined the term &#8216;artist&#8217;. Nickson&#8217;s attention in his discussions of &#8216;Art&#8217; tended to focus on the artist, rather than the object. This was a result of his world view, which saw art objects as an emanation from the personality of the artist; this necessitated the cultivation of a disposition of mind, which was enabled by the acquisition of mystical intuition. While his description of the fine arts as consisting of architecture, sculpture, painting, poetry and music was in line with older views of art, his views on the artist are difficult to discern, which raises the question of whether Nickson saw himself as an artist. Clearly his vocation was not as a composer, as the discussion of his mass settings in Chapter 3 will demonstrate, while as an organ teacher he was more interested in interpretation than in the mechanics of playing the instrument. This thesis falls into two broad sections. The first three chapters seek to provide an adequate biography of Nickson, which has never previously been done. The fourth chapter examines Nickson&#8217;s worldview and the implications this had for his thinking about music, and falls into two parts. The first part follows Nickson&#8217;s worldview as it was expressed in his essays, and focuses attention on the concept of art as a process of sign making. The manner in which this sign making is understood is essential to its function, and in Nickson&#8217;s writings three understandings emerge: symbol, metaphor and sacrament. The second part of the discussion examines Nickson&#8217;s articulation of his worldview in relation to music, which he considered to be the most divine of the arts, drawing on lecture notes, student reminiscences and Nickson&#8217;s own. Nickson&#8217;s central claim was that art is a sacrament. This can be seen in relation to his faith, where the regular use of the Church&#8217;s sacraments was central. This claim is challenged by statements Nickson made about the faith of composers such as Beethoven and Bach. This raises questions about sacramental efficacy when applied to art, and some limitations implicit in viewing art as a sacrament. It will be argued that Nickson conceived of artistic creation as fundamentally a process of sign making. The sign may be regarded as a symbol, metaphor or sacrament, and the process of creating the sign reflects God&#8217;s own creative activity in human creative acts. Nickson conceived of human creative action as having a redemptive character, bringing the artist into closer unity with the godhead. This union was the ultimate aim of art, being the act of redemption that paralleled the union brought about by such sacraments as the Eucharist. This term also points to some tensions in Nickson&#8217;s worldview, where he expressed a view of the creation of the material world as being both a dynamic, continuing activity of emanation from God, and a single action of the will of God, such as the creation account of Genesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arthur Ernest Howard Nickson</field><field name="subject">Church music</field><field name="subject">Organists</field><field name="subject">Music teaching</field><field name="subject">Music criticism</field><field name="subject">Neoplatonic philosophy</field><field name="subject">Sacramental theology</field><field name="subject">Anglo-Catholicism</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp66.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Music of Dom Stephen Moreno, OSB: A study of its sources, chronology and context</field><field name="creator">Curtis, Paul Raymond</field><field name="description">Dom Stephen Moreno OSB (1889-1953) was one of Australia&#8217;s most respected and prolific composers of church music in the early twentieth century. He lived for almost fifty years in the Benedictine Community at New Norcia, WA, and composed 210 works, comprising over 1100 individual compositions and over 200 accompaniments to Gregorian chant. The majority of his output was in liturgical sacred music, including Masses, motets and Litanies, but it also included a significant quantity of secular vocal and instrumental music. Much of Moreno&#8217;s music was written for the Benedictine Community of New Norcia but he also composed liturgical music for the broader Australian church and secular music for the wider Australian community. Less than a quarter of Moreno&#8217;s music was published, and the vast majority of his output survives in manuscript at New Norcia. The purpose of the present study is to define the extent of Moreno&#8217;s output, to establish its chronology, and to examine the contexts and purposes for which he composed. This study has significantly added to and revised the findings of previous studies of Moreno&#8217;s music undertaken by Ros (1980) and Revell (1990) and supplies a revised biography. Approximately thirty-five percent of the works included in this study are identified and discussed here for the first time. Of the previously known works, Ros specifically dated less than one quarter and the present study refutes some seventy-four percent of Revell&#8217;s dates. Through the investigation of important primary sources, including the composer&#8217;s surviving correspondence and the Chronicle of the Benedictine Community, this study provides for the first time a complete chronology and contextual account of Moreno&#8217;s entire oeuvre. This has involved the cataloguing and indexing of over ten thousand pages of Moreno&#8217;s manuscripts and more than five thousand pages of his personal correspondence. This study has also identified a number of compositions unique to collections outside of New Norcia. While the primary purpose of this study has been to establish an accurate chronology and historical context for each work, the opportunity has also been taken to provide a preliminary assessment and discussion of Moreno&#8217;s musical style and compositional methods. Note: &#8220;Due to the inclusion of third party copyrighted material we are unable to mount the entire thesis. It can however be viewed at St Patrick&#8217;s Campus Library by prior arrangement.&#8221;</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church music composers</field><field name="subject">Australian church music</field><field name="subject">Dom Stephen Moreno</field><field name="subject">Benedictine Community of New Norcia</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp162.11062008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lay Principals Under Contract: &#8216;Going Down for the Good Turf&#8217;: An exploration of the perceptions of selected secondary lay principals in relation to the religious and spiritual dimensions of their role</field><field name="creator">Davison, Liam G</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research study was to consider the understanding and experience of a selected number of lay principals of diocesan secondary Catholic schools in Victoria as to the religious and spiritual dimensions of their leadership role and to identify what supported them in the discharge of their responsibilities in these domains of their leadership. Based on this purpose, I identified three research questions: 1. What is the understanding of lay Catholic secondary principals in Victoria, of their role as a ministry within the Catholic Church? 2. In what ways have principals experienced the spiritual and religious dimensions of their leadership role? 3. In what ways have principals sought and/or experienced formation beyond academic study which has enriched their practice of principalship? The theoretical perspective of the research is Interpretative Constructionism and the methodology adopted is Multiple Informant Case Study. The researcher has taken the stance of &#8216;interrogatory fellow traveller&#8217; in relation to the research informants. The methods used to gather data are (a) focus group, (b) biographical written statements, (c) document analysis and (d) personal reflection in response to the previous three methods. In general, the findings of this research study suggest that lay principals of Catholic secondary schools who were informants in the study understand the role of principal of a diocesan secondary school as a ministry within the Catholic Church. While the informants did not use overtly theological terms to articulate this understanding, the accounts of their experience in principalship and the insights gained through reflection on their leadership behaviour have led them to believe that they are in fact exercising a legitimate ministry within the field of Catholic secondary education in Victoria. This research has brought to light a body of knowledge about the work of a group of principals which has not previously been subject to critical scrutiny. While the study is of intrinsic merit in recognising and describing the work of secondary lay principals, from an instrumental perspective these findings raise a number of issues relating to the preparation, induction and support available to newly appointed and continuing principals in diocesan Catholic secondary schools in Victoria. As a consequence the following propositions are offered: Further study using a wider informant group of principals is warranted to confirm the findings of this enquiry and to expand on the knowledge already gained. Such study might include parallel studies of lay principals in congregation-owned schools, in other states of Australia or in other countries where the Catholic Church has established schools as an agency of its evangelising mission in education. This study is of potential assistance to aspiring principals, principals and system authorities in the planning and development of appropriate professional learning and support, including formal academic study and formational opportunities. The findings confirm the importance for leaders and aspiring leaders in Catholic education of sound theological and spiritual education as a necessary part of their preparation for leadership, both pre-service and in-service. The findings confirm the significance of appropriate liturgical induction or commissioning for principals. It is suggested that one practical form of support for principals is the provision of access to regular professional supervision and spiritual direction. It is recommended that the process of appointment and induction of principals be undertaken more systematically, perhaps using the principles of project management, especially in relation to the identification of enhancing and inhibiting factors present within the staff community at the time of the appointment of a new principal. The findings indicate that schools have had varied experiences of developing a distinctive ethos and charism, based on a particular founder or group of founders. It is recommended that all diocesan secondary schools be encouraged to develop an appropriate charism and spirituality, based on the character of the local faith community and the history of the particular school. The findings point to the need for further development of an authentic spirituality of educational and faith leadership, based in the reality of principals&#8217; lives as family and community members and educators in faith of their staff and wider community. Informants to the study indicated their awareness of the tension between occupying a leadership role in the Church and personal positions in conscience on matters of Church teaching. Some further study of this issue may be warranted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Lay principals</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp122.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motherhood Statements: Mothers and their Adolescent Daughters</field><field name="creator">Deacey, Cathy L</field><field name="description">Despite significant change in women&#8217;s lives in recent decades, the prevailing ideology of motherhood is predominantly based on nineteenth-century ideals. Underpinned by a socially-constructed, idealised version of womanhood, the dominant paradigm promotes an essentialist model of maternal excellence largely grounded in the early childhood context; that of the &#8216;good mother&#8217;. Amidst deviancy discourse that has historically beleaguered women who failed to fulfil prescribed standards of good mothering, this thesis contends that the ideology of motherhood that remains dominant requires substantial revision. Central to this is the need to understand the range of historical factors that shape and influence cultural, and thus, personal understandings of the role of a good mother. Accordingly, the literature reviewed is subjected to critical analysis, examining stereotypical depictions of women that have historically typified the archetypal ideal. Particular consideration is given to sociological, psychoanalytic and feminist accounts of motherhood, mothering and the mother-daughter relationship. Therein, the focus of this study involves assessment of the degree to which the cultural meaning attributed to being a good mother influences personal perceptions and the lived experience of mothering. While the literature reviewed provides a useful foundation for considering the likely impact the ideology of motherhood has upon the lives of contemporary women, it also highlights that the maternal perspective has been noticeably absent from much of the literature. Given the centrality of the maternal role in reproducing existing conditions of mothering, and indeed, the mother-daughter relationship (Chodorow, 1978), this study is perhaps long overdue. Based on a case study involving twelve Melbourne mothers, this thesis highlights both the commonalities and considerably divergent experiences of motherhood and the mother-daughter relationship in the postmodern context.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motherhood</field><field name="subject">Depiction of women</field><field name="subject">Contemporary women</field><field name="subject">Maternal role</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp79.09042006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reinventing a School for the 21st Century: a case study of change in a Mary Ward School</field><field name="creator">Degenhardt, Leoni Marilyn</field><field name="description">The focus of this study is the attempt of one school, Loreto Normanhurst, to draw from its values base and traditions to develop and implement a new holistic paradigm of schooling, more relevant to the needs of its 21st century students. Loreto Normanhurst is a Catholic secondary day and boarding school for girls in the northern suburbs of Sydney, Australia. It is a school over 100 years old, associated with the 400 year old, Mary Ward, international tradition of educating women. The aims of the study were threefold: to document and analyse the process of reinvention from a &#8216;living systems&#8217; perspective (Senge et al., 2000; Sergiovanni, 2000), while it was happening, thereby enhancing the reinvention process itself through a reflexive approach; to document and acknowledge the efforts of the members of the school community in seeking to meet the needs of its students in a 21st century context; and, through its blend of theory and practice, to contribute both to the literature on educational leadership and school reform, and to practice in schools. The study was limited to Loreto Normanhurst, the school in which the researcher is principal. A mixed methodology was adopted, although the study was chiefly qualitative. As an ethnographic case study, it incorporated phenomenological data from the school community, as well as some quantitative data. The particular situation of the researcher, however, as an insider researcher in a position of power within the community studied, necessitated some innovative methodological strategies in order to protect both the participants and the integrity of the research. The situation of the researcher led also to the incorporation of the research traditions of autoethnography and transpersonal research methodologies. The researcher drew from the literature on change, culture and leadership to analyse and interpret data gathered, predominantly, over a five-year period. The study traces the process of reinvention within the school from 2001 to 2005. Most of the data were gathered between 2001 and 2004, although antecedent data, particularly from 1994 to 2000, were included, as well as some data from 2005, by which stage the new paradigm had been implemented for two years within the school. The study presents findings in three main areas: change processes in schools; educational leadership; and insider research methodology. Findings related to change processes are addressed in two parts. The first of these relates to the development, implementation and evaluation of the new educational paradigm, while the second relates to the school&#8217;s attempt to &#8216;continually reinvent&#8217; itself, thus institutionalising change (Schein, 1992). The school&#8217;s values played an important role in both of these aspects of change. Findings related to educational leadership are derived from the study of the school&#8217;s reinvention processes. These findings include insights into how a range of leadership theories supported, or failed to adequately support, leadership of the reinvention process as well as the identification of twelve dilemmas associated with leadership for change in a Mary Ward school. Findings related to methodologies for insider researchers in positions of power address the need for techniques, methods and research traditions which will protect participants and the research, as well as assisting the researcher in managing the multiple roles entailed in research of this kind. The study concludes with important contributions to the fields of school reform, educational leadership, and insider research methodology. First, it offers a framework for the reinvention of a school and the development of a culture of continual reinvention. This is the eight-step &#8216;Framework for Reinventing a School&#8217;. Second, it proposes a model of leadership for such a reinvention, identified as &#8216;Contemplative-reflexive leadership for reinvention&#8217;. Third, it presents a more fully developed method for conducting insider research, which can be used by school principals and others in positions of authority. This is known as &#8216;PIRM &#8211; Powerful Insider Research Method&#8217;: a research method for use by insider researchers in positions of power in their own organisation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Mary Ward Schools</field><field name="subject">Educational change</field><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp99.29082006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How Is Power Used In The Catholic Church? A case study of a group of male religious in the Archdiocese of Melbourne</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Peter</field><field name="description">Aim. While there is much talk of an emerging interest in spirituality in Australia, there is evidence of a declining affiliation with the established Churches. The impact of mainstream Christianity in these circumstances would appear to be waning. The continued attention given to the Church in the wake of these realities and that of the Church's dealing with situations of sexual abuse has often focussed around the way in which the Church has used its power and influence. While undoubtedly there is much evidence of the Church's service and care for its members and those most in need, more questions are being asked about the accountability of those who minister within the boundaries of Catholic Church structures, and the healthiness of those very structures for helping the Church to live out its mission with integrity. Further questioning has often been around the perceived intent of Church authorities, as seen by many, to return the Church to times prior to the Second Vatican Council when clerical authority was unquestioned. There are divergent viewpoints as to whether the call of the Council for wider involvement of lay people in Church decision-making and structures is in the process of being reversed. The researcher, coming from his experience as a member of a Catholic Religious Congregation of Men, is interested in looking broadly at the issue of how power is used in the Catholic Church, with a particular focus on a case study of one Group of Male Religious in the Archdiocese of Melbourne. The aim of the study is to provide further insight into use of power in the Catholic Church, and to offer some recommendations for future use of that power in a healthy and constructive way for the benefit of the Church and, ultimately, all of society. Scope. A Literature Review was carried out to investigate the broader issues of how power may be defined. A multitude of answers emerged, resulting in a rich understanding of power and some specific related factors: gender, hegemony, patriarchy, authority, leadership, empowerment and networks. Following these explorations around how use of power may be understood, examination of issues relating to abuse of power took place. Given this background, attention was then given to issues of power in relation to Church structures. With these learnings, the researcher conducted five focus groups of people who had relevant knowledge of the male Religious Congregation in Melbourne, which was the specific case study for this research. The groups included current members of the Congregation, former members, staff members in schools run by the Congregation, former students and a women's group. The study was restricted to one specific Congregation, the 'Brothers of St Charles' [fictitious name], in Melbourne, in order to provide a particular and manageable focus. While limited in scope, the study provides an analysis of the focus groups and a linking between this analysis and the Literature Review. Conclusions. The study finishes with some reflections by the researcher on the learnings of the study and recommendations arising from the study. Central place is given to the quality of relationships of those engaged in ministry on behalf of the Catholic Church. An interplay of personal and Church/Congregational factors is proposed in order to provide some qualitative assessment of the effectiveness of such relationships. In order for ministers to take up and use their power in an enriching way for themselves and particularly for those to whom they are called in service, recommendations are made around the need for learning about use of power as part of formation for Church personnel, around encouraging ongoing personal growth in those in Church ministry, around the importance of engaging in processes of healing where people have been hurt by past inappropriate use of power, and around the need to continually critique and challenge existing Church structures where there is injustice through lack of inclusivity.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="subject">Sexual abuse</field><field name="subject">Catholic Religious Congregation</field><field name="subject">Male Religious</field><field name="subject">Archdiocese of Melbourne</field><field name="subject">Church structures</field><field name="subject">Abuse of power</field><field name="subject">Ministry</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp15.25072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiences of Teachers&#8217; Daily Work Which  Nourish and Sustain the Spirituality of Lay Teachers in Catholic High Schools</field><field name="creator">Downey, Michael John</field><field name="description">The hierarchy of the Catholic Church has stated that formation of lay teachers is essential for the personal sanctification of the teacher and the apostolic mission of the Church (CCE, 1982, #65) and that &#8220;formation must be broadened and kept up to date, on the same level as, and in harmony with, human formation as a whole (CCE, 1982, #62). The research reported in this thesis: (1) explores Catholic Church documents and other literature in order to gain insights into the spirituality of teachers who teach in Catholic schools; (2) identifies experiences of teachers&#8217; daily work in Catholic high schools that nurture and sustain teacher spirituality; (3) explores how the insights revealed can inform the practices of formation for lay teachers in Catholic schools. The demonstrated success of a teacher formation known as The Courage to Teach invited exploration to gain understanding of the principles and practices of formation that could prove helpful for developing formation practices within Australian Catholic Education. The research reported in this thesis included teachers reflecting upon their daily experiences of work and identifying, what one called, &#8220;moments of grace&#8221; that nourished and sustain teachers&#8217; spirits. These experiences were identified as teachers&#8217; experiences of community and their experiences of making a difference. For Catholic schools to continue to have authenticity, the ongoing formation of lay teachers is essential. This does not mean, as others have said, &#8220;adding more water to an already overfull cup&#8221; by including formation as one more thing for teachers to do. It means making space and providing the opportunity for teachers to discover the &#8216;moments of grace&#8217; that providentially fill their day. In conversation with Catholic Scripture and Tradition, these moments of grace will nurture and sustain the vocations of lay teachers in Catholic schools, so that lay teachers will both flourish and &#8220;teach with authority&#8221; (Mk. 1:22).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic Schools</field><field name="subject">Lay teachers</field><field name="subject">Teacher spirituality</field><field name="subject">Australian Catholic education</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp112.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paul, Jerusalem and the Judaisers: the Galatian crisis in its broader historical context</field><field name="creator">Elmer, Ian Jeffrey</field><field name="description">The thrust of this thesis is encapsulated in the title &#8211; Paul, Jerusalem and the Judaisers: The Galatian Crisis in Its Broader Historical Context &#8211; which reflects the author&#8217;s insistence that reconstructing all the events surrounding the crisis that impelled Paul to compose his letter to the Galatians is essential to understanding this letter. The position taken in this study is that the Galatian crisis was initiated by a group of Judaising opponents acting under the direct authority of the Jerusalem church. The origins of this controversy can be traced back to the early dispute between the Hellenists and the Hebrews described in the Acts of the Apostles, which led to the expulsion of the Hellenists from Jerusalem and the establishment of the community in Antioch. Paul&#8217;s opponents apparently cited Jerusalem as the source of and the warrant for their Law-observant gospel. In Galatians, Paul alludes to events involving Judaising opponents that transpired in Jerusalem and Antioch prior to the outbreak of the crisis at Galatia. Thus, the immediate background of the crisis is found in the Jerusalem Council (Gal 2:1-10; Acts 15:1-35) and the Incident at Antioch (Gal 2:11-14). Turning to the conflict in Galatia itself this thesis attempts to explore the links between these earlier events and the Galatian crisis. The primary avenue for this examination will be via a consideration of Paul&#8217;s argument in Galatians. By the careful use of the mirror-reading technique, this thesis will endeavour to reconstruct the message and the origins of Paul&#8217;s opponents. The thesis concludes with a brief examination of Paul&#8217;s later conflicts with Judaising opponents at Corinth and Philippi, as well as the autobiographical material in Romans, all of which will provide an insight into the eventual outcome of the crisis in Galatia</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saint Paul</field><field name="subject">Judaism</field><field name="subject">Galatians</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp163.08072008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Relating to Women Attaining Principal Positions in Victoria's Government Secondary Colleges: a Case study</field><field name="creator">Ertan, Naciye</field><field name="description">Regardless of the promotion structures employed within the different educational systems of this country, men dominate the position of Principal of secondary schools. Despite legislation seeking to provide equality of opportunity and the apparent breaking down of deeply entrenched societal attitudes of women being the servers or followers, there still exist factors that give rise to the under-representation of women in Principal positions of secondary schools. This thesis was designed to investigate issues associated with the apparent gender imbalance in Principal positions in Victoria's government secondary schools. It will attempt to identify elements that have militated against women gaining such positions. The research methodology employed to investigate the problem is a case study approach. The study centered on a girl's school, Gilmore College for Girls, which has had a succession of female Principals. The research involved inviting women who were Principals of Gilmore College for Girls to participate in an interview. Within that format structured interviews were used to seek the women Principals' perceptions as to factors leading to this under-representation of women as Principals. The findings from this study are then interpreted in the light of factors by which the literature explains the problem. Various reasons emerged to explain the lower number of women Principals. It seemed to stem from perceptions about their roles, which limited the level of their involvement in schools: for instance once women teachers were married with children they were less likely to advance in their careers and to apply for Principal positions. The workload of the Principal was also identified as one of the factors inhibiting women from applying for Principal positions. It was seen to make marriage and child rearing almost impossible. Therefore most women were content to be classroom teachers and only apply for positions that suited their interests and allowed them to meet family, home and social commitments. It is suggested that further related investigations be pursued of women in Principal positions of our secondary schools.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gilmore College for Girls</field><field name="subject">Women principals</field><field name="subject">Secondary school prinicipals</field><field name="subject">Victorian government secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">Equality of opportunity</field><field name="subject">Workload</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp44.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8216;What Should I do?&#8217;: a study of social work ethics, supervision and the ethical development of social workers</field><field name="creator">Esler, Marian Therese</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the ethical development of social workers and the role of supervision in that development. It begins with an examination of the social work context for the study, including the early history of social work and the ways in which it was influenced by the major social and cultural movements of the late 20th century, concluding with a discussion of both the threats posed and the possibilities emerging for social work in the 21st century. It then considers the ethical context for the study. It investigates the ethical theories and traditions that have contributed to the development of social work ethics and the role of professional ethics (including codes of ethics). It then proposes that a pluralist approach to social work ethics is the most appropriate way forward. This is followed by an examination of ethical development and the importance of reflection. Various models of ethical decision-making are compared and an inclusive, reflective model is found to be the most appropriate for social work in terms of both particular dilemmas faced and the overall development of workers as ethical decision-makers. The focus of the thesis then moves to supervision, exploring its history, its central place in social work and some of the problems that can arise for both supervisors and the social workers they supervise. It is argued that the reflection required to develop as ethical decision-makers is most logically located within the relationship and processes of supervision and that supervisors have an important role in guiding that reflection and development. The next part of the thesis describes the qualitative and action research strategies employed and examines the results emerging from the data. Participants in the focus groups were social workers who supervise other social workers, and they each met for two sessions, six months apart. Between the two sessions, they were asked to trial in supervision a framework for reflection on practice. The data emerging from the groups reflected the theoretical development begun in the early chapters, including the importance of reflection and the role of supervision in assisting the ethical development of workers, particularly in terms of deconstructing dilemmas and being able to articulate the reasons for decisions made. The thesis concludes that no one ethical theory is sufficient to support the ethical decision-making required for the practice of social work. Rather, a pluralist approach that allows a dilemma to be considered from a number of theoretical perspectives is more appropriate. Alongside this, an inclusive, reflective model of ethical decision-making reflects that pluralist approach and supports the ethical development of the individual worker. Supervision is vital in guiding the reflection required to make justifiable ethical decisions and to develop as ethical decision-makers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ethical development</field><field name="subject">Social work training</field><field name="subject">Social work ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp152.29052008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Value of Transition Support Programs for Newly Registered Nurses and the Hospitals Offering the Programs in New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Evans, Jennifer</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis explored the perceived value of transition support programs for newly registered nurses in New South Wales and the health care facilities offering such programs. Although transition support programs have been designed and implemented in various forms since the transfer of nurse education to the tertiary sector, there remains little evaluative evidence of the value of such programs. Two groups of registered nurses formed the participants in this study. The first were new graduate nurses who completed a transition support program within the past 12 months. The second comprised experienced nurses who worked with new graduate nurses during their transition support program. The study was carried out in seven hospitals in area health services across and around Sydney, representing both small and large facilities with bed numbers ranging from 195 to 530. Data were collected from four sources including the printed materials made available by sample hospitals. Questionnaires, interviews and observations were used to determine the purposes, outcomes and strengths and weaknesses of transition support programs. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and theme extraction. The themes described the ways in which the transition support programs were used to facilitate the transition of the newly registered nurse to confident beginning practitioner. There was widespread belief from the study participants that some aspects of nurse education at university were inadequate. As a result, various structures and policies were required to support the new graduate nurses as they entered the workplace. The transition support programs were used to increase nursing staff for the study hospitals and to provide new learning opportunities for new graduate nurses to enable them to develop the clinical and professional skills required of competent registered nurses. The rotational aspect of the transition support programs were used to provide staff for the less popular areas of the hospital as well as a variety of experiences and skill development opportunities that were considered lacking in the current undergraduate education of nurses. The work environment where the programs operate were described as difficult with nurses exposed to violence and bullying practices from fellow staff and frequently required to work with a less than ideal number or appropriate skill mix of nursing staff. The hospitals also used the transition support program to exert a controlling influence over the new graduate nurse by way of roster management, assessment of skills and the expectation that each nurse would complete a transition support program before being offered full time work. The thesis concludes with recommendations and future research avenues. It would be useful for hospitals to conduct formal evaluations of the transition support program they offer to provide the most effective program possible. One source of information could be sought from the new graduate nurses regarding their needs during the first six months of employment. It is also suggested that a study be commenced that investigates the reasons behind the perception that nurse education at universities in New South Wales is inadequate.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transisiton Support</field><field name="subject">Nurse education</field><field name="subject">Registered nurses</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp94.29052006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Religious Education Coordinators&#8217; Perceptions of their Role in Catholic Secondary Schools in the Archdiocese of Melbourne</field><field name="creator">Fleming, Gerard Patrick</field><field name="description">This thesis analysed Religious Education Coordinators&#8217; perceptions of their role in Catholic secondary schools of the Archdiocese of Melbourne from 1970 &#8211; 2000.  The theoretical framework for the study, which was reported on in this thesis, was drawn from Catholic Church documents on religious education at both international and national levels, and from the work of researchers within the field of religious education. In particular the study investigated the diversity of language used to describe religious education and religious education theory and analysed the significance that this has had in the development of an understanding of the role of the Religious Education Coordinator.  It was argued that there were significant factors in the development of the role of the Religious Education Coordinator that included changes in the understanding of the nature and purpose of religious education during the second half of the twentieth century. In addition there were historical factors peculiar to the Archdiocese of Melbourne that played an important part in the understanding of the RECs role.  Quantitative data in the form of annual survey material (1988-1999) from the Catholic Education Office Melbourne provided a framework for the empirical component of the research. The empirical component involved the interviewing of Religious Education Coordinators from a deliberately selected sample that covered the range of skills and experiences deemed necessary in the research. The purpose was to ascertain from the perspective of the Religious Education Coordinators themselves how they analysed their role. Grounded theory methodology was used as the basis for the inductive analysis of the data that emerged from the in-depth interviews.  Theory that was generated on the role of the Religious Education Coordinator includes: the importance of an understanding of the theoretical dimensions of religious education and the role of the Religious Education Coordinator; an elaboration of the role of the Religious Education Coordinator in the school context and the necessary skills and attributes that are required to meet the challenges in the role; and the complexity of the challenges that are faced by the Religious Education Coordinator.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religious Education Coordinators</field><field name="subject">Catholic secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Archdiocese of Melbourne</field><field name="subject">Religious education</field><field name="subject">Religious education theory</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp17.16082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theology Engaging Evolutionary Theory: Fresh insights into the nature of God</field><field name="creator">Foord, Peter Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the work of three theologians, Arthur Peacocke, John Haught and Denis Edwards, each of whom has made a significant contribution to the dialogue between contemporary evolutionary biology and the Christian understanding of God. The thesis explores and analyses how evolutionary theory throws light on key theological themes such as the nature of God's providence, especially in relation to pain, suffering and evil, and the meaning of Jesus Christ. The thesis involves a critical reading of the selected theologians' works, with their respective emphases on classical, process and kenotic types of theological thinking, and also draws on resources from the classical theological tradition, primarily St. Thomas Aquinas.  The study gives a positive assessment of the contributions of the three chosen authors. It highlights the critical importance that theological methodology plays in formulating insights into the relationship of God to evolutionary processes. Peacocke emphasises the use of critical realism as the most credible methodology for theology, consistent with its use by science. Haught agrees with this approach stressing, however, that the data of theology is not the same as that for science. Consequently, he argues that theology ought to constitute the deepest layer of explanation for understanding reality and for understanding God as the ultimate explanation for evolution. Edwards argues that we must find a way of talking about God that is consonant with the reality of the world but that this God always remains ultimately Mystery.  Peacocke, Haught and Edwards explore the usefulness of kenotic theology for explaining how belief in an omnipotent and supremely loving God can be reconciled with the existence of pain, suffering and evil in the creation. Although a kenotic approach can account for the scientific evidence of a &#8220;self-creative&#8221; and emergent cosmos along with the presence of suffering and evil, a more comprehensive theological viewpoint must include an understanding of how God is active in creation, sustaining it in existence and drawing it towards its divinely ordained end.  Haught's argument for the presence of genuine contingency in the cosmos as evidence of God's on-going creativity is critically examined. Genuinely new possibilities, in evolutionary terms, new species, cannot be explained by material causation alone. In his &#8220;metaphysics of the future&#8221;, Haught argues that, despite the enormity of pain and suffering evidenced in evolution, God continues to lovingly draw the creation towards a hopeful and promised future in God.  This thesis appreciates the value of Edwards&#8217; trinitarian &#8220;God of evolution&#8221; for it combines a more classical theological approach with evolutionary theory. For Edwards, biological evolution is seen as a process within an ontologically relational creation that reflects the divine relations of the Trinity. The creation of being-in-relation flows out of, and reflects, the divine trinitarian relations of mutual love. Edwards&#8217; insights into the nature of original sin and grace within an evolutionary context are also positively assessed. Both Peacocke and Edwards propose a Wisdom Christology as the most fruitful link between the biblical Sophia tradition and a creation theology, holding together insights on the divine Being, Wisdom and the Christ-event itself.  Aspects of process and kenotic theologies can be usefully combined with Aquinas' expansive notion of God as ultimate Being. Through this synthesis, the drama of evolution is more intimately related with the ultimate reality, the Mystery of God.  Throughout this thesis, gender-neutral language has been maintained except in some quotations of St. Thomas Aquinas.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arthur Peacocke</field><field name="subject">John Haught</field><field name="subject">Denis Edwards</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary biology</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary theory</field><field name="subject">Creation theory</field><field name="subject">Christian understanding of God</field><field name="subject">Trinitarian God of evolution</field><field name="subject">St Thomas Aquninas</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp45.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drama and Religious Education: a match made in heaven</field><field name="creator">Frawley-Mangan, Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the use of drama as a teaching tool in religious education within the context of sacramental preparation.

Manipulations of platform amplitude or frequency can affect the rate of change of the WBV (i.e. acceleration) acting upon an individual. The specific influences of frequency or amplitude, however, are unknown. The aim of the study, therefore, was two fold; (1) to identify chronic WBV effects of neuromuscular performance within a community dwelling older adult sample, and; (2) to identify WBV methods that would elicit chronic neuromuscular performance changes within such a sample. The study incorporated a randomised controlled experimental design to examine the aim. Seventy-three community dwelling older adults freely consented to the requirements of the study (mean age = 72.0 years). Neuromuscular performance was quantified with the 5-Chair Stands test, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and the Tinetti test. Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) was qualified with the SF-36 Health Survey. A six week WBV intervention significantly changed the quantifiers of neuromuscular performance in a community dwelling older adult sample. The WBV intervention significantly reduced time taken to complete the 5-Chair Stands test (p &lt;.05) and the TUG test (p &lt;.05). The six week WBV intervention significantly improved Tinetti test scores (p &lt;.05). The six week WBV intervention significantly improved all components of HRQOL. For the 5-Chair Stands test, a three WBV sessions per week intervention elicited significantly larger (p &lt;.05) neuromuscular performance gains than a two WBV sessions per week intervention in the target sample. For the TUG test, a three WBV sessions per week intervention elicited significantly larger (p &lt;.05) neuromuscular performance gains than a zero and one WBV session per week intervention in the target sample. A significant difference (p &lt;.05) was found between pre-test and post-test Tinetti test scores for all WBV intervention groups. There was an insignificant difference (p &gt;.05) found within the control group of community dwelling older adults for the Tinetti test. Detraining effects were observed three weeks after the cessation of the six week WBV intervention for the three WBV sessions per week group. Neuromuscular performance reduced after the detraining period. Vibration platform dynamics (manipulated frequency and controlled amplitude) showed that gravitational forces created by the WBV were safe since no injuries were associated with the intervention and since participant compliance was 100% during the six week WBV intervention. The methods of this study showed a chronic WBV intervention to be a safe and easily administered exercise to improve neuromuscular performance and HRQOL of a community dwelling older adult sample. Specifically, WBV could be used as a safe and effective tool to improve aspects of normal daily function such as body balance and gait speed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Whole body vibration</field><field name="subject">Neuromuscular performance</field><field name="subject">Older adults</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp153.29052008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Set Text Study: a Collective case study</field><field name="creator">Gleeson, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the practice of set text study as it is encountered within the English curriculum of a Victorian secondary school. The study evolved from a range of concerns to do with the researcher&#8217;s own teaching and the attitudes being expressed in her school community. It developed into an investigation of the student experience of reading, and of studying the required texts in subject, English This research aims to: &#8226; provide understanding of the development of set text study and to consider whether this construct is meeting the goals of contemporary English teaching examine both the beliefs which underpin the practices and the practices themselves provide greater understanding of the way students experience this aspect of their school learning consider how notions of transformation, insight and emerging identity through literature study fit with student experience Five guiding research questions address the issues which gave rise to the study. These questions provide a focus and structure throughout the research process. The questions address issues of: students&#8217; school and non-school reading practices, enjoyment, beliefs about learning, ideology and specifically, the potential influence of textual representations of suicide and adult characters on a teenage student&#8217;s emerging sense of self. An overview of key theoretical positions on the act of reading situates the attitudinal and theoretical aspects of this research. The practical orientation of this study is situated alongside research on the experience of reading and of teaching literature, both from Australia and overseas. This thesis adopts a phenomenological approach within a constructivist framework. A qualitative methodology using a case-study approach, allows for the prolonged engagement necessary to explore the research questions and develop the sort of relationship necessary to facilitate the in-depth and reflective responses being sought. In-depth interviews (both face-to-face interviews and on-line chat sessions) are the primary data-gathering tool. In reporting the findings, the student voice is privileged. Practical and theoretical notions of communication and language are explored. The processes used to undertake this research are reflected upon and some possibilities for incorporating some of these methods into a school learning context are considered. While the focus of the study is to increase understanding of individual experience, some clear findings emerge. Although reading played an important part in the non-school lives of most of these students, the school experience of reading was more often than not, disappointing. Key factors which students perceived as contributing to their lack of enjoyment and satisfaction included: text choice, lack of challenge in lesson content, the sameness of the associated tasks, the behaviour of peers and lack of opportunity for having their opinions heard. Almost conversely, the students who gained greatest satisfaction reported on: particular texts, the creativity and scope for individual input of required tasks, teacher involvement, more positive class interaction and specific modelling by teachers of required tasks. The thesis concludes with recommendations for structural support (both whole school and classroom) to enable the positive shared reading experiences to become the experience of more students. It challenges the sanctity of the set text and offers a range of alternatives. In calls on teachers to consider the implications of entering a continuing story of students&#8217; reading and to work at developing better ways of incorporating components of effective non-school reading practices into school reading practices. The concerns regarding the potential negative influence of set texts on a student&#8217;s identity were not validated in this research. However new concerns for students&#8217; well being did emerge. The research indicates that set texts can make a difference to the quality of students&#8217; lives. By incorporating a range of texts and class activities, by knowing students as well as possible, and by fully engaging as co-readers, teachers are in a better position to minimise student distress and to attend to the work of creating democratic reading environments with the greatest potential for reading success for everyone.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School set texts</field><field name="subject">English curriculum</field><field name="subject">English teaching</field><field name="subject">Literature teaching</field><field name="subject">Victorian secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Reading</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp67.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Praesentia Substantialis: an examination of the Thomistic metaphysics of the Eucharistic presence</field><field name="creator">Goodwin, Colin Robert</field><field name="description">1. Aim of the Thesis. This thesis is concerned to investigate the schemata of metaphysical concepts, and the lines of philosophical argument, used by Thomas Aquinas in reaching conclusions about the nature of the change through which Christ becomes present in the sacrament of the Eucharist, and about the nature of this continuing presence. Although the object to which the thesis relates is provided by doctrinal and theological affirmations, the perspective within which the investigation takes place is that of the reflective rationality distinctive of philosophy. Put differently, the aim of the thesis is to examine the speculative rational work undertaken by Thomas Aquinas in the course of his discussion of issues relating to the change of bread and of wine into the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist - a discussion that Thomas introduces by first arguing to traditional Catholic belief about the outcome of this change. The examination engages with the reasonable explanatory power of the conceptual resources and the philosophical arguments drawn upon by the Angelic Doctor in his systematic study of the Eucharistic change, and of the implications of this change relative to the continuing presence of Christ in the Eucharist. 2. Scope of the Thesis. The parameters of the thesis are set by St Thomas&#8217;s discussions of Eucharistic change and presence that take place in part three, questions 75-77, of his Summa Theologiae, book four, chapters 60-68, of his Summa contra Gentiles, and book four, distinctions 10-11, of his Scriptum super Libris Sententiarum Petri Lombardi. Within these parameters are to be included contributions to the issues discussed by St Thomas made by Thomas de Vio Cajetan, Domingo Banez, and Silvester of Ferrara (Ferrariensis), major commentators on the work of Thomas. Extensive presentation, and scrutiny, of opposing arguments from Duns Scotus are also included. Following an introductory chapter concerned to situate, summarise, and indicate its principal assumptions, the thesis explores what is, for St Thomas, a major objection to affirming the substantially real presence of Christ in the Eucharist: such an affirmation is said to imply the ontological impossibility that Christ&#8217;s bodily reality is simultaneously present in more than one place. The response to this objection involves an analysis of the distinction between the primary and the secondary formal effects of dimensive quantity, and the use of this distinction to argue at some length that one and the same material thing may be simultaneously present in more than one place if the secondary formal effects of dimensive quantity that would spatially situate this thing in relation to its immediate surroundings are suspended. The thesis then considers three issues dealing with what becomes of the substance of the bread and of the wine at the Eucharistic consecration. In the first of these, Thomas rejects the claim that the substance of the bread and of the wine remains in existence on the altar, affirming that the bread and wine are changed at the level of substance into the body and blood of Christ. This position requires, and receives, sustained treatment of philosophical questions concerning &#8216;substance&#8217;, and change affecting the whole substance of a thing (within a hylomorphic understanding of material realities). Related problems of individuation, causal agency, and the logic of language that both signifies, and brings about, change, are considered. The second issue investigates the claim that the substance of the bread and of the wine is not changed after all into the body and blood of Christ but is either annihilated or changed into matter-in-an-earlier-state. This claim is rejected by St Thomas on philosophical grounds, and this section of the thesis engages critically with Cajetan on several points connected with Thomas&#8217;s arguments The third issue concerns, and affirms, the capacity of bread and wine to be changed substantially into the body and blood of Christ, at which point the thesis widens out to contrast a hylomorphic with a hylomeric account of matter, and to consider at some length Duns Scotus&#8217;s metaphysics of the Eucharist which oppose those of St Thomas. Chapter six of the thesis explores in some detail the responses of Cajetan and Ferrariensis to the challenges issued by Scotus, and the concluding chapter (chapter seven) provides an analysis of Thomistic ideas regarding three modes of the emergence of being: creation, natural change, transubstantiation. 3. Conclusions. The title asserts that the thesis is &#8220;an examination of the Thomistic metaphysics of the Eucharistic presence&#8221;. This examination endorses the following conclusions: 3.1 The schemata of metaphysical concepts employed by St Thomas (e.g. the concepts of substance, accident, esse, primary matter, substantial form, creation, natural change, obediential potentiality, primary/secondary formal effects of dimensive quantity), and his lines of philosophical argument, provide a clearly valid response to &#8220;the exigencies of the inquiring mind at work&#8221; in relation to the presence of Christ in the Eucharist. In other words, their reasonable explanatory power is evidently to be affirmed. 3.2 Pari passu the thesis indicates something of what could be called &#8216;the mystery of matter&#8217; &#8211; the inexhaustible depths and potentialities of matter that the inquiring mind confronts when exploring matter in the distinctive situation that is matter&#8217;s special dependence on the First Cause in the Eucharistic change (transubstantiation). 3.3 The thesis is an instance of philosophical work undertaken in the first decade of the 21st century, and within the socio-cultural context of this time. This socio-cultural &#8216;situatedness&#8217;, although vastly different from the socio-cultural &#8216;situatedness&#8217; of Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Cajetan, Ferrariensis, and Banez, has created no culturally relative barrier - no &#8216;incommensurability&#8217; - such as to prevent an understanding of the conceptual/argumentative activity in which these thinkers engaged some centuries ago. Human beings always and everwhere &#8216;fit into&#8217; the same Universe through their abiding and ineluctably shared openness to being and its first principles.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metaphysics</field><field name="subject">Thomas Aquinas</field><field name="subject">Eucharist</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp138.17052007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Translation of The Quaestio Disputata de Spiritualibus Creaturis of St Thomas Aquinas, with Accompanying Notes</field><field name="creator">Goodwin, Colin Robert</field><field name="description">Scope of the work - This research project involves two components. The first is a translation from Latin into English of St Thomas Aquinas&#8217;s Quaestio disputata de spiritualibus creaturis. This is an important, though largely neglected, work of St Thomas dating from 1267- 68, dealing with a range of issues relating to the two categories of created spirits recognised by Thomas, viz. angels and human souls. The perspective of the Angelic Doctor is principally, though not exclusively, that of philosophy rather than of theology. What is found in the disputed question is the development of a number of arguments, and the consequent taking up of a number of positions, that are the immediate source of what St Thomas has to say about angels and the human soul in the first part (prima pars) of his Summa Theologiae - a part which was completed by 1268. What he has to say about the Averroistic view that there is only one receptive intellect, and only one agent intellect, for all human beings (see Articles 9 and 10 of the disputed question) prepared the way for his crucially important polemical treatise of 1270, the De unitate intellectus contra Averroistas. The project provides a complete translation of the Quaestio disputata de spiritualibus creaturis which extends across eleven &#8216;articles&#8217; addressing selected questions concerning angels and/or human souls, viz. matter/form composition, modes of union with (or separation from) matter, specific differences between angels, receptive intellect and agent intellect in human beings, and the distinction between the soul and its powers. Pages vi- vii of the Introduction to the project discuss the way in which the translation of the text of St Thomas has been approached. To cite one sentence: &#8220;An attempt has been made at all times to use a style of translation that is pleasantly readable, non-jarring, and non-pedantic&#8221; - but one that is subject to total fidelity to expressing the philosophical meaning of St Thomas. The second component of the project is eleven sets of notes (one hundred and seven pages in all), each set of which belongs to one or other of the eleven articles making up the text of St Thomas as translated. There is a degree of cross-referencing between some of the notes belonging to particular articles. The notes are of varying length and are concerned to facilitate an understanding of what the Angelic Doctor has to say in his Quaestio disputata de spiritualibus creaturis. Most of the notes fall into one or other of the following categories: biographical (providing information about a number of persons whose names appear in Thomas&#8217;s text), historical (giving information about institutions and events connected with the time, or life, of St Thomas), exegetical (explaining why a particular English translation of Thomas&#8217;s Latin has been used, or illustrating a point in the text by citations from other works of the Saint, or on occasion taking issue with some feature of the critical Latin text of Leo Keeler, S.J., on which the translation has been based), and &#8216;philosophical extension&#8217; notes (seeking to amplify what St Thomas has been arguing in the disputed question on created spirits by considering related issues in other works of his, or by further exploration of a concept or notion used in the text but not dwelt on by Thomas).  2 Aim of the work - The aim of the project has been to make available an accurate, and attractive, English translation from thirteenth century Latin of an important work of Thomas Aquinas, and to support this activity with accompanying sets of notes. The achievement of appropriate scholarly standards has been a pervasive intention in all that has been undertaken.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">St Thomas Aquinas</field><field name="subject">Quaestio disputata de spiritualibus creaturis</field><field name="subject">Angels</field><field name="subject">Human souls</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp18.16082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrostatic and thermal influences on intravascular volume determination during immersion: quantification of the f-cell ratio</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Christopher</field><field name="description">Previous data have shown that the most prevalent, indirect plasma volume (PV) measurement technique, which utilises changes in haematocrit (Hct) and haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), underestimates actual PV changes during immersion, when compared to a direct tracer-dilution method. An increase in the F-cell ratio (whole-body haematocrit (Hctw) to large-vessel haematocrit (Hctv) ratio) has been purported as a possible explanation, probably due to hydrostatic and thermally-mediated changes during water immersion. Previous investigators have not quantified the F-cell ratio during immersion. Therefore, this study sought to determine the effect of the F-cell ratio on the indirect method during both, thermoneutral and cold-water immersions. Seven healthy males were tested three times, seated upright in air (control: 21.2&#176;C SD &#177;1.1), and during thermoneutral (34.5oC SD &#177;0.2) and cold-water immersion (18.6oC SD &#177;0.2), immersed to the third intercostal space for 60 min. Measurements during the immersion tests included PV (Evans blue dye column elution, Evans blue dye computer programme, and Hct [Hb]), red cell volume (RCV; sodium radiochromate), cardiac frequency (fc) and rectal temperature (Tre). Plasma volume during the control trial remained stable, and equivalent across the three tests. There was a hydrostatically-induced increase in PV during thermoneutral immersion, when determined by the Evans blue dye method (16.2%). However, the Hct/[Hb] calculation did not adequately reflect this change, and underestimated the relative PV change by 43%. In contrast, PV decreased during cold immersion when determined using the Evans blue dye method by 17.9% and the Hct/[Hb] calculation by 8.0%, respectively, representing a 52% underestimation by the latter method. There was a non-significant decline in RCV during both immersions. Furthermore, an increase (8.6%) and decrease (-14.4%) in blood volume (BV) was observed during thermoneutral and cold-water immersions, respectively. The decline in RCV during thermoneutral immersion attenuated the BV expansion. Despite the disparity between the PV methods, there was no increase in the F-cell ratio during either immersion. In contrast, there was a significant decline in the F-cell ratio during the control: air and thermoneutral immersion, which may indicate that other, undefined variables may impact on the stability of the red cell compartment. The current study is the first to show that the Hct/[Hb] method clearly underestimates PV changes during both thermoneutral and cold-water immersion. Furthermore, RCV was shown, for the first time, to decline during both immersions. However, the changes in the F-cell ratio during this study, did not account for the underestimation of PV change using the Hct/[Hb] method.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">F-cell ratio</field><field name="subject">Plasma volume measurement technique</field><field name="subject">Haematocrit concentration</field><field name="subject">Haemoglobin concentration</field><field name="subject">Thermoneutral immersion</field><field name="subject">Cold-water immersion</field><field name="subject">Intravascular volume</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp4.14072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Use of Scripture in the Teaching of Religious Education in Victorian Catholic Secondary Schools</field><field name="creator">Grace, Michael James</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the use of scripture by religious education teachers with their students in Victorian Catholic secondary schools in late 1999.  The aims of the research were: to present a picture of the incorporation of scripture into the religious education program of Victorian Catholic secondary schools in 1999, and in particular the incorporation of the historical-critical method of modern biblical scholarship (focus will also be placed on the purpose for which scripture is used, the extent to which it is used and the methods employed in its use); to investigate how and to what extent VCE Texts  and  Traditions1 Units 1 to 4 have been adopted by senior Victorian Catholic secondary students and its influence on Years Seven to Ten religious education curriculum; and to extend the work of Stead (1996b) into the use of scripture in Victorian Catholic primary schools. This study is built on an understanding of religious education based on an educational rationale, and it examines the use of scripture in the light of modern critical biblical scholarship, particularly the historical-critical method. Religious Education Coordinators from 67 of the 99 Victorian Catholic secondary schools and 61 teachers of Years Seven to Ten religious education in these same schools completed self administering questionnaires in this area. The research demonstrated that while there is an extensive range of good modern biblical scholarship material present in these schools, there is no policy concerning how scripture is to be used in the curriculum, questionable translations of the bible are used, and there is a limited use of many sections of the bible. A key finding of the research is that a thematic, proof-texting use of scripture is prevalent in these schools. This thematic use can lead to a literal, fundamentalist use of scripture within Catholic secondary religious education. This approach is linked with many religious education teachers. predominantly catechetical understanding of the nature of religious education. The self administering questionnaires asked for an indication of the personal practice of respondents in their own religious education classrooms. The data indicated the presence of the historical-critical method in the classrooms of Victorian Catholic secondary schools, however there was an over-reliance on the student text and the predominance of a thematic, literal, non-critical use of scripture. This thesis indicates that this misuse of scripture comes about from teachers. catechetical understanding of the nature of religious education. In particular the study of scripture in Years 11 and 12 is an area of concern. Except for a small percentage of students studying Texts and Traditions (13%), the use of the historical-critical method of biblical studies is almost non-existent.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scripture</field><field name="subject">Religious Education</field><field name="subject">Catholic Secondary Schools</field><field name="subject">Teaching</field><field name="subject">Historical-critical method</field><field name="subject">Victoria (Australia)</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp31.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exercise Type, Musculoskeletal Health and Injury Risk Factors in Adolescent Middle-Distance Runners</field><field name="creator">Greene, David</field><field name="description">Adolescent growth provides a unique opportunity for the growing body to adapt to external stimuli. A positive association between site-specific mechanical loading and increases in regional bone mineral content (BMC) during adolescence is established. Mechanical loads associated with middle-distance running expose the skeleton to a combination of compressive ground reaction forces and muscular contraction. Previous studies concerning musculoskeletal health in active adolescents are largely limited to planar, two-dimensional measures of bone mineral status, using Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Intrinsic bone material properties are accurately measured using DXA. However, the interaction between bone material and structural properties that reflects the mechanical integrity of bone require a combination of imaging modalities. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides a three-dimensional geometric and biomechanical assessment of bone. When MRI is integrated with DXA technology, an effective non-invasive method of assessing in vivo bone strength is achieved. The impact of high training volumes on musculoskeletal development of male and female adolescent athletes engaged in repetitive, high magnitude mechanical loading has not been investigated. Specifically, differences in total body and regional bone mineral, bone and muscle geometry, bone biomechanical indices and bone strength at differentially-loaded skeletal sites have not been compared between adolescent middle-distance runners and age- and gender-matched non-athletic controls. Objectives: (i) to investigate the effects of intense sports participation involving mechanical loading patterns on bone mineral, bone and muscle geometry, biomechanical indices and estimated regional bone strength between elite adolescent male and female middle-distance runners and age- and gender-matched controls (ii) to examine factors predictive of total body BMC, distal tibial bone geometry, distal tibial bone strength, and Hip Strength Analysis (HSA)- derived indicators of bone strength at the femoral neck. Methods: Four groups of 20 adolescents were comprised of male (mean (SD) age 16.8 &#177; 0.6 yr, physical activity 14.1 &#177; 5.7 hr.wk-1) and female (age 16 &#177; 1.7 yr, physical activity 8.9 &#177; 2.1 hr.wk-1) middle-distance runners, and male (16.4 &#177; 0.7 yr, physical activity 2.2 &#177; 0.7 hr.wk-1) and female (age 16 &#177; 1.8 yr, physical activity 2.0 &#177; 0.07 hr.wk-1) controls. Total body and regional BMC were calculated using DXA. Distal tibial bone and muscle cross-sectional areas (CSA) were assessed using MRI. To calculate distal tibial bone strength index (BSI), a region of interest representing 10% of the mid distal tibia was analysed for DXA-derived bone mineral and was combined with bone geometry and biomechanical properties from MRI assessments. Calculations for femoral neck strength were acquired from DXA-derived HSA software. Results: No differences were found between male athletes and controls for unadjusted BMC at total body or regional sites. After covarying for fat mass (kg), male athletes displayed greater BMC at the lumbar spine (p = 0.001), dominant proximal femur (p = 0.001) and dominant leg (p = 0.03) than male controls. No differences were found in distal tibial bone geometry, bone strength at the distal tibia or HSA-derived indicators of bone strength at the femoral neck between male athletes and controls. Lean tissue mass and fat mass were the strongest predictors of total body BMC (R2 = 0.71), total muscle CSA explained 43.5% of variance in BSI at the distal tibia, and femur length and neck of femur CSA explained 33.4% of variance at the femoral neck. In females, athletes displayed greater unadjusted BMC at the proximal femur (+3.9 &#177;1.4 g, p = 0.01), dominant femoral neck (+0.5 &#177; 0.12 g, p = 0.01) and dominant tibia (+4.1 &#177; 2.1 g, p = 0.05) than female controls. After covarying for fat mass (kg), female athletes displayed greater (p = 0.001) total body, dominant proximal femur and dominant leg BMC than female controls. Female athletes also showed greater distal tibial cortical CSA (+30.9 &#177; 9.5 mm2, p = 0.003), total muscle (+240.2 &#177; 86.4 mm2, p = 0.03) and extensor muscle (+46.9 &#177;19.5 mm2, p = 0.02) CSA, smaller medullary cavity (-32.3 &#177; 14.7 mm2, p = 0.03) CSA and greater BSI at the distal tibia (+28037 &#177; 8214.7 g/cm3.mm4, p = 0.002) than female controls. Lean tissue mass and fat mass were the strongest predictors of total body BMC (R2 = 65), hours of physical weekly activity and total muscle CSA explained 58.3% of the variance of distal tibial BSI, and neck of femur CSA accounted for 64.6% of the variance in a marker of femoral neck HSA. Conclusion: High training loads are associated with positive musculoskeletal outcomes in adolescent middle-distance runners compared to non-athletic controls. Exposure to similar high training loads may advantage female adolescent athletes, more than male adolescent athletes compared with less active peers in bone strength at the distal tibia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Musculoskeletal development</field><field name="subject">Injury risk factors</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp80.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Pentecostal Study of Daniel&#8217;s Prince of Persia (Daniel 10:13)</field><field name="creator">Guntrip, Elizabeth Denham</field><field name="description">Aim.C. Peter Wagner is a well-known missiologist. In the late twentieth century Wagner became interested in the means by which the devil, as the enemy of God, obstructs the spread of the Gospel. Based on his reading of Daniel 10:13 [20-21], a passage referring to the prince of Persia, he concluded that the earth is ruled by Satan&#8217;s angels, whom he terms &#8220;territorial spirits.&#8221; The same chapter mentions other supernatural beings, Michael, one of the chief princes and the prince of Greece. In Wagner&#8217;s understanding Scripture reveals the existence of good and evil spirits having authority or control over specific geographical regions. Further, Wagner believed he had discovered why evangelism is ineffective in some locations - territorial spirits blind the minds of the populace and need to be bound spiritually to remove hindrances to the gospel&#8217;s reception. Wagner devised a prayer methodology called Strategic Level Spiritual Warfare (SLSW), to accelerate world evangelisation by strategically targeting designated cities or locations with aggressive prayer to disarm the spiritual powers of wickedness. SLSW depends for effectiveness on the associated practice of spiritual mapping,&#8221; entailing foundational research into an area&#8217;s historical and spiritual background preceding the prayer programme. Wagner believes SLSW to be both divinely revealed and empirically verifiable. The SLSW methodology spread with startling rapidity to many sectors of Christianity. SLSW became associated with Pentecostalism, and is now mistakenly assumed to be a Pentecostal teaching. This thesis aims to show this is inaccurate. Scope. C. Peter Wagner, an Evangelical, is associated with Third Wave groups who deliberately distance themselves from the Pentecostal label. Classical Pentecostalism is differentiated historically from the later Charismatic Renewal Movement. Third Wave groups are a separate more recent spiritual movement, sometimes known as neo-charismatics. Neither Wagner&#8217;s theological nor ecclesial location is Pentecostal, but this fact has not helped negate the mistaken assumption that his teaching originated within Pentecostalism. In order to demonstrate the difference between Wagner&#8217;s demonology and that of Pentecostalism, their respective interpretive methods need to be compared. This task was approached firstly by showing what comprises a Classical Pentecostal hermeneutic. Three distinctive principles were identified for a conventional Pentecostal reading of Scripture, namely: (1) the Protestant Reformation principle of Sola Scriptura, (2) a pneumatic approach to interpreting Scripture and (3) biblical revelation, not self-revelation, in the community of faith. In the past, Pentecostals depended on academic writings stemming from within Evangelicalism. This was a dependence of convenience, since historically Pentecostalism had no systematic theology, nor until comparatively recently a critically active academia. The disadvantage of this borrowing has been that Pentecostals have been obliged to filter out anti-Pentecostal bias evident in much Evangelical literature. The text Daniel 10:13 was then exegeted using these principles. This narrow focus is based on Wagner&#8217;s use of this text as the foundation of his demonology. Using a combined theological and literary approach, stances on reading the book of Daniel in general and Daniel 10:13 in particular were discussed. The relaxation of tensions between the factions which divided biblical scholarship for much of the twentieth century has allowed some cross-fertilization of ideas and methods, without reducing the ideological chasm separating the camps. The history of the text was recognised but meaning was sought more particularly from the form of the extant text. The results were tested against the principles of Pentecostal hermeneutics. Finally, Wagner&#8217;s writings on SLSW were appraised. His hermeneutical method was compared with the Pentecostal hermeneutical principles, the Pentecostal reading prepared from the exegesis, and the demonology of two Classical Pentecostal writers. Discussion of SLSW was confined to Wagner as the initiator of the concept. Wagner&#8217;s specific contribution has been in relating a hypothetical demonic hierarchy according to their perceived function (not simply the degree of power they may possess). He is well aware that his theory stands or falls on the issue of whether demonic spirits can legitimately be seen as occupying territories. Conclusions. Whilst some aspects of Wagner&#8217;s demonology and hermeneutic are held in common with that of Pentecostalism, the mistaken identification of SLSW as Pentecostal has led to confusion. Notwithstanding Wagner&#8217;s high view of Scripture and enthusiasm for evangelism, the hermeneutic employed in his interpretation of Dan 10:13 is not consistent with that of Classical Pentecostalism. The conclusion reached was that C. Peter Wagner&#8217;s teaching on SLSW should not be labelled Pentecostal.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">C.

Methodologically, by  &#8216;appropriate&#8216; in this study is meant  &#8216;suitable&#8216; or  &#8216;proper,&#8216; taking into account the rhetorical and literary conventions of second-century Graeco-Roman culture, the contemporary social situation, Justin&#8216;s rhetorical and/or intended audience and his purpose. Would Justin&#8216;s arguments from the point of view of second-century standards have been reasonable, possessing at least a potential for effectiveness, or would they have been either ignored, dismissed without serious consideration, or even worsened the plight for Christians? I believe this work fills a significant gap in our knowledge of Justin, being the first time a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness, or otherwise, of Justin&#8216;s arguments has been made in one single study. SCOPE This Thesis is divided into six major chapters, plus a Conclusion: (i) In Chapter One I provide a brief introduction discussing how and why the Apologists emerged during the second century AD to meet the challenges of the day, as well as outlining the aim and scope of this study. (ii) In Chapter Two I discuss the nature of Christian Apology, its relationship to petitions to the Roman emperors, and how it compares to other (non-Christian) apologetic, protreptic, educational and missionary discourses. I also examine the rhetorical and literary conventions of the second century Graeco-Roman world and outline how Justin employed rhetoric in his three known works. (iii) In Chapter Three I outline in detail the particular attacks experienced by the Christians in Justin&#8216;s time. (iv) In Chapter Four I examine the questions of intended destination, structure and purposes of Justin&#8216;s apologetical works. (v) In Chapter Five I analyse the appropriateness of Justin&#8216;s apologetical arguments in 1 and 2 Apologies. (vi) In Chapter Six I analyse the appropriateness of Justin&#8216;s apologetical arguments in Dialogue. In all, eight distinct arguments from the Apologies (Behaviour, Beliefs, Due Process, Threat, Similitude, Dependence/Source, Antiquity/Prophecy, Miracles) and four distinct arguments from Dialogue (Superiority, Fulfilled Prophecy, Miracles, True Israel) are outlined in detail and then analysed giving the reasons for and against their appropriateness. CONCLUSIONS In my Conclusion, I argue that all of Justin&#8216;s arguments were appropriate for one or more reasons, with only the argument of Threat in the Apologies being largely inappropriate. At the same time, all his arguments contained notable weaknesses, except for the argument of Similitude. The following table is provided, listing each of Justin&#8216;s apologetical arguments and the number of reasons I give for their respective appropriateness/inappropriateness, together with a yes/no/mixed conclusion in the final column: [Table not shown].This table is simplistic, nevertheless it does illustrate that the question of appropriateness is rarely a simple one, as more often than not there exist simultaneous reasons for and against the appropriateness of any particular argument. How has this study furthered our knowledge and understanding of Justin and his apologetical works? What can we conclude about Justin and his works based on the appropriateness or inappropriateness of his arguments? It is clear that for both the Apologies and Dialogue the strengths of Justin&#8216;s arguments outweigh their weaknesses. The strengths generally pertain to philosophical, religious, or ethical aspects of the works that are presented logically and cogently while the weaknesses, by and large, result from Justin&#8216;s tendency towards arrogance and abuse. Justin wrote very much the way he lived. As a philosopher and skilled debater Justin was not above offending and demeaning those with whom he did not agree if he thought this would increase the reception of his message. His brilliance and arrogance proved to be a lethal combination and led to his ultimate silencing. It perhaps also curtailed the effectiveness of his writings for no change of policy was ever effected during his lifetime, or at least universally implemented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apologetics</field><field name="subject">Justin Martyr</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp173.09092008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">We Grow in the Shade of Each Other: A study of Connectedness, Empowerment and Learning in the Middle Years of Schooling</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Mauricette Ann</field><field name="description">Learning is enabled in an environment that promotes connectedness. This belief led me to an exploration of connectedness and the discovery that connectedness has more than one connotation in the literature. For some it means making connections within curriculum areas, which is closely associated with the understanding that connectedness means teaching and learning within a community of learners. Another body of literature understands connectedness as a person&#8217;s sense of belonging within the family, school and wider community. Embedded in all these understandings of the term is either implicit or explicit reference to empowerment.An exploration of learning necessarily involves an exploration of students and teachers perceptions of effective learning. The exploration of learning focuses on: teacher and students understanding of learning, student expectations and achievements within the classroom, the opportunities for participation and contribution. The various understandings of connectedness, empowerment and learning are linked in the exploration of the following themes within the classroom: Building caring relationships, Setting high and achievable expectations and Providing opportunities for participation and contribution (Bernard, 1991; 1997; MindMatters, 2000). The context is the middle years of schooling as the last 10 years has produced research that delivers findings asking teachers in the middle years to negotiate a curriculum that is based on people. Effective teaching and learning is essential if students are to achieve their potential, should be cooperative and be fostered within a reflective community atmosphere. Relationships are to the fore in all concepts of effective middle schooling and this case study explores relationship as they exist at Garden College in year seven. It is these relationships that promote a sense of belonging to and empowerment within the learning community, thus enabling learning. If schools are to &#8220;expedite the development of effective middle schooling&#8221; (Schools Council, National Board of Employment, Education and Training, 1993, p. 65), by addressing the issues highlighted above, I believe the concepts of connectedness, empowerment and learning must be fully explored by the community of learners in each school.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Connectedness</field><field name="subject">Empowerment</field><field name="subject">Middle secondary school</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp95.29052006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two Australian Pilgrimages</field><field name="creator">Hanafford, John</field><field name="description">In a time of rapid social change pilgrimages are resurfacing as significant and visible social phenomena. Australia has historically been noted as a very secular society but in recent years there has been some scholarly attention to forms of spirituality outside of the orthodox, Church religion. In matters of national identity and commitment to place it is argued that there could be an upsurge in spirituality, in contrast to the decline of those practising formal religion. In this dissertation it is argued that two journeys undertaken by contemporary Australians can be considered true pilgrimages with spiritual dimensions and are therefore part of a growing spirituality apart from formal Church. A survey of the theological and anthropological literature about pilgrimages allowed the development of an eight-point frame of criteria that could be used as a standard against which an assessment of contemporary journeys could be made. Pilgrimage is a non-local physical journey to a historically and or mythically significant site or shrine that embodies the centre of a person&#146;s most valued ideals. These ideals may or may not be theistic but must be portrayed within the limits of the culture. The shrine casts an image of the culture and has an expert shrine custodian, but has the capacity to absorb a multiplicity of discourses. Pilgrims go to a shrine to experience the place of past events, take home spiritual traces and to model a changed or improved future. In order to apply this frame to two Australian journeys, field trips were made to the plaster image of Mary at Our Lady of Yankalilla Church in South Australia and to Gallipoli in Turkey around the Anzac Day commemorations in 2000. Participant observations and interviews with six key informants, when considered in association with the historical context and media reports, provided &#145;thick description&#146; of the behaviour at the journey destinations and insight into participants&#146; experiences, motives and understandings. Both journeys, the sacred and ostensibly secular, satisfied the frame of criteria for a pilgrimage. Furthermore they may also exemplify some features that are distinctively Australian, in that in these pilgrimages spontaneity and egalitarianism jostled against bureaucratic structures and national hierarchies.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pilgrimage</field><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Shrine</field><field name="subject">Our Lady of Yankalilla Church</field><field name="subject">Gallipoli</field><field name="subject">Contemporary Australia</field><field name="subject">Sacred</field><field name="subject">Journeys</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp5.19072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Number Sense or No Sense: Pre-service teachers learning the mathematics they are required to teach</field><field name="creator">Hanrahan, Frances M</field><field name="description">As a result of two years working with the pre-service primary teachers in a College in Fiji I became aware of the difficulty many of the students were having understanding the primary school mathematics they would be required to teach. During that time I had attempted to help them overcome the difficulties by using different teaching approaches and activities but was far from satisfied with my efforts. Hence I decided to make a concerted effort to help the students by planning, implementing and partially evaluating a mathematics education unit, known as the Teaching Program for the first semester of their course. This work formed the basis of my study. For the Teaching Program I chose a constructivist teaching approach with number sense as the underlying theme. To examine the aspects of the Program I used my observations and those of the students especially ones reported in their mathematics journals. To evaluate the effectiveness of the Teaching Program I collected and analysed quantitative data from traditional testing of the class of forty students as well as data from case studies of six of the pre-service teachers in the class. To determine what features of the Teaching Program were linked to positive changes my main source of data was the case studies, especially entries from their journal writings. The findings suggested that a significant development of the cognitive aspects of the students&#8217; number sense did occur during the time of the Teaching Program but not as much as was hoped for. As a result of the analysis of the data I came to a greater realisation of the importance of the non-cognitive aspects of number sense and the necessity for a greater consideration of them in the development of a Program. I also realise now that a major development that did occur was in my understanding of the knowledge and learning of mathematics. My ideas of a teaching paradigm of social constructivism had not guided me sufficiently to incorporate activities and procedures to develop the non-cognitive aspects. I suggest that a paradigm which extends the theory of social constructivism to give greater consideration of these aspects of learning in general, and hence numeracy and number sense in particular, was needed. As a result of this study, my introduction to the theory of enactivism appears to be giving me some direction in this search at this stage.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Constructivist teaching approach</field><field name="subject">Mathematics learning</field><field name="subject">Mathematics teaching</field><field name="subject">Number sense</field><field name="subject">Pre-service primary teachers</field><field name="subject">Primary school mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp19.16082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a Fifth Gospel via Schillebeeckx and Solle</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Ann-Marie</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis, Towards ajifth gospel via Schillebeeclx and Solle, is a search for God and God's gospel. It is a quest in which I combine Edward Schillebeeckx's belief that Christian life is a fifth gospel and Dorothee Solle's praxis-orientated theology into a contrapuntal theological conversation. I argue that through each theologian's vision of Christian life a theological and hermeneutical framework is established within which men and women of faith can interpret change and prepare the world and church for God's transforming newness. The scope of this thesis identifies a life-giving Christianity by investigating common theological themes in the work of Schillebeeckx and Solle. On the basis of the insights of both theologians I argue that all believers are called to critically reinterpret belief in the God of Jesus, that human experience is the horizon for reflection and interpretation. That mystics and prophets communicate God's saving love within an ethic of responsibility for this world, and that when Christian communities engage in</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fifth Gospel</field><field name="subject">Edward Schillebeeckx</field><field name="subject">Dorothee Solle</field><field name="subject">God</field><field name="subject">God's Gospel</field><field name="subject">Christian life</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp32.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paradoxes, Parallels and Pedagogy: A case study of Ignatian Pedagogy and of teachers&#8217; perceptions of its implementation in Australian Jesuit Schools</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Christopher Xavier</field><field name="description">In 1986 the International Commission on the Apostolate of Jesuit Education (ICAJE) produced a document titled The Characteristics of Jesuit Education. This document was an attempt to define the distinctive nature of Jesuit Education. Seven years later, Ignatian Pedagogy: A Practical Approach (1993) was written by the same body in response to the following questions:  How can the principles and orientation of The Characteristics be made more useable for teachers?  How can Ignatian values be incorporated into a practical pedagogy for use in the daily interactions between teachers and students in the classroom? This study investigates the nature and origins of Ignatian Pedagogy, and its implementation in Jesuit schools in Australia. The first part of the dissertation is a documentary analysis and interpretation. It traces the historical development of Ignatian Pedagogy in the context of Jesuit history and spirituality, and clarifies its purposes in relation to the educational mission of the Jesuit order. The inspiration for Ignatian Pedagogy is based on the purpose and methodology of the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius Loyola. The dissertation describes the implementation of the Pedagogy within the five Jesuit schools in Australia in the period 1994 to 2000. Ignatian Pedagogy is then located and evaluated within an educational framework. Its purposes are compared and contrasted with 5 different learning theories (Behaviourist; Cognitivist; Humanist; Social Learning and Constructivist), and comparisons are also made with approaches to &#8216;personal change&#8217; education such as Groome&#8217;s Shared Christian Praxis, Freire&#8217;s Pedagogy of the Oppressed and Critical Pedagogy. It is shown that Ignatian Pedagogy has many points of similarity with elements in these various theories; the pedagogy was somewhat eclectic in the ideas it incorporated in trying to be faithful to the original vision of Jesuit education, while seeking to provide a coherent across-the-curriculum strategy for promoting the spiritual and moral development of pupils.The second part of the dissertation reports a qualitative empirical study of teachers&#8217; perceptions of the Ignatian Pedagogy and its implementation in Jesuit schools. This data collection set out to investigate the level of congruence between the intentions of Ignatian Pedagogy and teachers&#8217; perceptions of its purposes. A sample of teachers from all five Jesuit schools in Australia were interviewed in small focus groups and the data were analysed and interpreted using the method of grounded theory according to Strauss and Corbin (1990). Their responses were consistent with the findings from interviews with a selection of &#8216;key informants&#8217; &#8211; very experienced educators/administrators within Jesuit schools who had a more extensive and responsible role in schools for the implementation of the Ignatian Pedagogy. 5 key themes were abstracted from the data. The core theme was the paradoxical nature of Ignatian Pedagogy. The teachers on one hand referred to it as &#8220;good teaching practice&#8221; and yet struggled to understand and implement the pedagogy. Other themes were the relational, methodological, Christian ministry and political categories. The data shows a level of congruence between the intentions of the Pedagogy, the historically stated aims and purposes of Jesuit education and the perceptions of current Australian teachers in Jesuit schools implementing the pedagogy. The data also shows problems with implementation: ecclesiastical/religious/educational terminology caused difficulties; the term &#8216;pedagogy&#8217; itself resulted in misunderstandings; the politics of implementation were influential. The study shows that Ignatian Pedagogy as an attempt to sustain and develop the vision of Jesuit education for the lay people who now constitute the teaching staff in Jesuit schools incorporated ideas that are also prominent in other theories of education for personal change. Also, because of the natural complexities and uncertainties in links between pedagogy and actual spiritual/moral change in pupils, Ignatian Pedagogy, like other intentional spiritual/moral pedagogies, (e.g., critical pedagogy, values education), exhibits common problems with its conceptualisation and implementation. Ignatian Pedagogy is best interpreted as a &#8216;global ministry perspective&#8217; informing teaching across the curriculum. The study helps put Ignatian Pedagogy into perspective within the context of contemporary Australian education. It shows how an educational thrust towards the development of critical thinking, social awareness and responsibility has been attempted within Jesuit education. The dissertation concludes with proposed implications for the more effective presentation and implementation of Ignatian Pedagogy. While these implications have particular relevance for Jesuit schools and religious schools in general, they also relate to the contemporary interest in the spiritual and moral dimensions to Australian education as evident in the national Values Education programme.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Jesuit Schools</field><field name="subject">Ignation pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Spiritual development</field><field name="subject">Moral development</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp100.04092006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination of Seagrass Monitoring Protocols as Applied to Two New South Wales Estuarine Settings</field><field name="creator">Hossain, Md Mustafa Kamal</field><field name="description">Many recent studies have sought to monitor health characteristics of seagrasses, including changes in aerial extent, biomass and fish community structure. While these studies have provided important information on the ecology of seagrass communities on southeast Australia, little attempt has been made to subject these sampling procedures to rigorous experimental testing and review. This study employed commonly-used standard methods for sampling seagrass community characteristics in two sites in New South Wales. Where possible, sampling protocols were tested for accuracy and efficiency at a range of temporal and spatial scales. The ARCView Geographic Information System was used to construct vegetation polygons of seagrass distribution on the Tweed River, and in the Ukerebagh Channel annually over a 5-year period. For one year (2000), distributions from identical photographs were mapped twice to identify procedural errors. In general, errors relating to incorrect boundary identification were low compared to inter-annual variability. Inter-annual variability in seagrass beds was higher than for adjacent mangrove and saltmarsh. Estimates of biomass were derived from standard replicate 0.25m x 0.25m quadrats. The experiment contrasted two sites of similar geomorphic setting. Ukerebagh Channel on the Tweed River, and Woolooware Bay with Botany Bay are both shallow, sandy marine deltaic settings supporting stands of Zostera capricorni. Significant differences were found in the degree of replication required to identify significant changes in seagrass biomass at the two sites. Ukerebagh Channel supported relatively dense stands of Z. capricorni with low intra-site variability. Here 8 replicates were sufficient to detect 10 percent change. Towra Point presented a contrast, in which 15 replicates were required to detect a similar level of change. Woolooware Bay at Towra Point has suffered from increased sedimentation relating to alterations in current velocities at Towra Point, and the result highlights the greater degree of replication required to determine significance changes in disturbed systems. The fish populations in the seagrass at Towra Point were sampled using buoyant pop nets. Fish communities differed significantly from those sampled in adjacent mangrove and saltmarsh. Differences in fish assemblages between spring high tides, neap high tides and low tides are attributed to movements of fish between seagrass and adjacent mangrove and saltmarsh. This mosaic of habitats is utilized by a number of species over a tidal cycle, with seagrass providing an important low-tide refuge for many species utilizing mangrove and saltmarsh at high tide. Limitations in the efficiency of buoyant pop nets were exposed in a novel experiment which demonstrated differences in escape rates between species. Flat-tailed mullet (Liza argenta) are likely to be under-represented in experiments using this technique. Recommendations are made regarding optimal sampling protocols for monitoring seagrass in the region. All techniques tested are suitable, though some require modification. Some texts have under-estimated the degree of replication required to appropriately monitor changes in seagrass biomass in disturbed systems, where density is lower and intra-site variability higher. The buoyant pop-nets may require modification in open-water seagrass situations where escape by Liza argenta and Acanthopagrus australis were at unacceptable levels.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seagrass monitoring protocols</field><field name="subject">New South Wales estuaries</field><field name="subject">Seagrass biomass</field><field name="subject">Fish populations</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp81.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Experience of University Academic Staff In their Use of Information Communications Technology</field><field name="creator">Howell, Gordon William</field><field name="description">This research explores issues encountered by academic staff in their adoption of technology within the teaching and learning environment. The context of this research is set within a global environment; where technology is seen as both underpinning and enabling the current period of rapid change. Both the literature and University documents purport that the use of technology is instrumental in the delivery of positive economic, educational and social change. The researcher identified a dissonance between administrative policy and practices, and academic practice in relation to the use of technology. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of academic staff in their adoption of technology within the teaching and learning environment. The literature review generated following research questions: 1. Why do academic staff use information communication technology (ICT)? 2. How do academic staff use ICT? 3. What are the barriers to the use of ICT that have been identified by academic staff? 4. How do academic leaders promote the use of ICT in teaching and learning? As the adoption of technology is essentially a social process, the epistemological position of constructivism, using an interpretative perspective, was adopted for this research. The methodology of case study is utilised as it allowed detailed exploration of self-perceptions and lived experiences of the participants in relation to their use of technology within their professional practice. 21 participants were initially selected for this study. From this group of participants Rogers&#8217; Theory of Diffusion was used to select those participants who could provide the most useful insights; resulting in the seven case studies documented in this thesis. Participants within the case studies ranged from those who were highly innovative, to those who were late technology adopters.This research concluded that for the academic mainstream, the deployment and availability of technology had reached a stage where hardware, software, internet connectivity and projection capability were no longer seen as impediments to their use of technology. All participants, ranging from the highly innovative to the late technology adopters, used technology for email, the world wide web (WWW), administrative tasks, and the preparation and presentation of their lectures. While the use of various technologies was universal among the participants, the predominant use of technology was to support the transmission mode of instruction. The research concluded that a constructivist educational approach was not closely linked to early technology adoption, but to the participants&#8217; individual educational beliefs. The educational beliefs of the participants were in conflict with their experience of the University&#8217;s practices, which reflected a lack of instructional leadership in relation to the use of technology</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Academics</field><field name="subject">Communications technology</field><field name="subject">Teaching and Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp164.10072008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming Professions: a case study of social work in the Australian Defence Organisation</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Roslyn Denise</field><field name="description">The research investigated the impact of cultural change on the professional identity and practices of social workers in the Australian Defence Organisation (ADO). The researcher sought to understand both the nature and impact of change. The literature was reviewed with regard to the research and understanding of the concept of profession. The review highlighted the ideological nature of profession and the way in which the dominant culture impacts on professionals&#8217; understanding of their identity and practice. The culture impacts on the development of the professionals&#8217; relationship with clients, professional values and practices, practice boundaries, autonomy and status, accountability and knowledge and skills. The analysis of the literature illustrated that professionalism reflected the cultural impact of industrial capitalism while the emerging new professionalism reflected the impact of late capitalism. The research was undertaken from 1995 to 2004, a time of significant reform and change in Australia. The changes were reflected in changing relationships in the political economy and subsequent government and societal reforms. The cultural hegemony or dominant discourse changed from industrial capitalism to late capitalism and this change challenges professional identity and practice. The thesis argues that, an analysis of the case of ADO social work, particularly ADO social workers&#8217;understanding of their identity and practice demonstrates the impact of professionalism from 1957 to the mid-1980s. From the mid-1980s to 1996, it is further argued, it is possible to discern the impact of new professionalism as ADO social workers pursued their identity and understanding of practice in terms of the cultural reforms, that is, the emerging new professionalism. The thesis identifies six areas in which both professionalism and new professionalism impact on professionals, their identity and practice together with six features of both professionalism and new professionalism. These features are reflected in the professional projects. A case study of ADO social work was undertaken. The case study was constructed so that it satisfied the tenets of the qualitative method: describing, understanding and explaining. The case data was analysed in terms of the framework established. This framework identified six features of professionalism and new professionalism. Documentary data was analysed, that is, the public statements, reports and evidence given by ADO social workers, which articulated their understanding of their professional identity and practice. The case study confirmed the impact of professionalism on ADO social workers&#8217; identity and practice. However, the data did not demonstrate that ADO social workers pursued their professional project in terms of the emerging new professionalism. Three explanations are suggested as to why ADO social workers resist cultural change and continue to pursue professionalism. The first reason is the finding that the profession of arms, the dominant profession in the organisation, resisted many of the reforms. This enabled ADO social workers to continue to understand their professional identity and practice in terms of professionalism. A second reason is ADO social workers&#8217; focus on the organisational restructuring of ADO social work services, a project pursued by many ADO social workers from 1973. The organisational restructuring is understood to be part of ADO social workers&#8217; professionalisation project in terms of professionalism. A third reason is that ADO social workers view the changing culture as a significant threat to their understanding of their professional identity and practice. Bureaucracy, hierarchy, the state, service, tradition, monopoly, institutions, authority, supervising were giving way to market, flexibility, outcomes, performance, competition, teams, entrepreneurialism and choice. Along with many professional colleagues ADO social workers view the changes as the &#8216;deprofessionalisation&#8217; of professionals in the ADO. The thesis argues that new professionalism will increasingly impact on the identity and practice of ADO social workers as members of a socially constructed occupation. Attempts by ADO social workers to continue to develop and maintain a professional identity and practice in terms of professionalism will mean that social workers will become irrelevant to the needs of the ADO and its Members and families. Professionalism is no longer part of the hegemony of the dominant culture. The thesis argues that the future for ADO social work lies in the pursuit of a critical professional project in terms of the emerging new professionalism, understanding that new professionalism like professionalism &#8216;masks&#8217; the oppressive nature of the capitalist project.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social work</field><field name="subject">Australian Defence Organisation</field><field name="subject">Cultural change</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp123.102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying Some Characteristics of Children&#8217;s Spirituality in Australian Catholic Primary Schools: A study within hermeneutic phenomenology</field><field name="creator">Hyde, Brendan</field><field name="description">This qualitative research study aimed to identify, through classroom observation and conversation, some characteristics of children&#8217;s spirituality in Australian Catholic primary schools. In the context of this study, spirituality was described as an essential human trait. While much of the recent literature in the field describes spirituality in terms of connectedness and relationality, in this study spirituality was described as a movement towards Ultimate Unity (de Souza, 2004a, 2004b), whereby at the deepest and widest levels of connectedness, an individual&#8217;s true Self may experience unity with Other. Spirituality was also described as the outward expression of such unity in terms of how one acts towards Other. Located within the constructionist epistemology, and in taking its philosophical stance from interpretivism, this qualitative study took its theoretical impetus from that stream of human science known as hermeneutic phenomenology. The videotaped life expressions of two groups of approximately six children in Year three (8-years-olds) and Year five (10-years-olds) in each of three Australian Catholic primary schools formed the texts that were reflected upon in order to gain insight into the spirituality of these children. The researcher met with each group on three occasions. Each group meeting, consisting of a semi-structured interview  (conversation) and an activity (observation) was structured around the three categories of spiritual sensitivity &#8211; awareness sensing, mystery sensing and value sensing &#8211; as proposed by Hay and Nye (1998). van Manen&#8217;s (1990) lifeworld existentials were drawn upon as guides to reflection upon the life expressions of these children. Hermeneutic phenomenological reflection upon the texts of this present study identified four characteristics of these children&#8217;s spirituality &#8211; the felt sense, integrating awareness, weaving the threads of meaning, and spiritual questing. As well, two factors which appeared to inhibit these children&#8217;s expression of their spirituality were also identified &#8211; material pursuit and trivialising. Each of the four characteristics identified reflected the descriptions of spirituality drawn upon throughout this study, particularly the notion of spirituality as a movement towards Ultimate Unity (de Souza, 2004a, 2004b). In some instances, these characteristics also revealed the emergence of the Collective Self, in which the individual Self of each child became unified with every other Self among the group of children. It was argued then, that a movement towards Ultimate Unity may entail the emergence of a Collective Self, in which, at the deepest and widest levels of connectedness, Self and Other become one and the same. The two inhibiting factors indicated that such a movement was thwarted in that these factors prevented the children from moving beyond their superficial self towards deeper levels of connectedness. As the result of this investigation, this present study proposed some recommendations for learning and teaching in the primary religious education classroom which may nurture spirituality. These include the creation of appropriate spaces for nurturing spirituality, allowing children time to engage in the present moment of their experience, the use of tactile experiences in religious education, and the need to begin with the children&#8217;s personally created frameworks of meaning. A learning model for addressing the spiritual, affective and cognitive dimensions of the curriculum has also been offered as a means by which to realise these recommendations for learning and teaching. As well, recommendations for the personal and professional learning of teachers and leaders in Catholic primary schools who seek to nurture the spirituality of their students have also been proposed in light of the characteristics of children&#8217;s spirituality that were identified. These include the formation and professional learning for teachers of religious education, and the possibility of revisioning the curriculum to explore where spiritual development might be addressed across the curriculum.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic primary schools</field><field name="subject">Chilren&#8217;s spirituality</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp82.04092006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Mental Health Care in Australia From a Social Justice and Human Rights Perspective, With Special Reference to the Influences of England and the United States of America: 1800-2004</field><field name="creator">Ibell, Bernadette Mary</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to analyze mental health care in Australia from a social justice and human rights perspective, in order to demonstrate that social justice as a philosophical manifestation of justice and fairness, is an essential ingredient in the theory and practice of mental health care. It is contended that the needs of the mentally ill would be most appropriately answered by the utilization of a Natural Law model, based on Finnis&#8217;s Natural Law theory. The Scope of the Thesis.The needs and care of the mentally ill are discussed, together with the treatment meted out to these vulnerable members of society since, approximately, the year 1800. Neither the criminally insane, nor the intellectually disabled are included in this discourse. Each group of people merits a thesis on its own: criminal insanity requires a debate to include the history, psychiatric and legal approaches to the subject, and current management of the insane. The intellectually disabled are not mentally ill; their ability to function as all round, naturally competent individuals is diminished by an inadequacy and/or impairment of their intellectual capacities. The needs of these two groups are far too broad and demanding to be included within the current thesis. Rationale for the Timeframe The timeframe, 1800 until 2004, has been established because it approximates to the transition from the end of the Classical through the Modern Age to the Post Modern Age, together with the predominance of Enlightenment philosophical theories, and the development of a scientific approach to medicine. Further, many politico-economic and social changes were taking place, associated with the Industrial Revolution. All are shown to have affected the introduction of asylumdom, and the institutionalization of those unable to participate actively in the industrial workforce. Of significant importance to the development of institutionalization for such marginal groups is the philosophy of Jeremy Bentham. Bentham espoused Classical Utilitarianism which will be shown to believe that the ultimate standard of utility is not the individual&#8217;s happiness but the greatest amount of happiness altogether. The thesis will demonstrate that this philosophical view prevailed from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, with Benthamism influencing the sequestration of the unemployable into institutional life. Development of the Thesis.The thesis is developed against a background of prevailing philosophical, and other changes as stated above, including the medicalization of mental illness and the development of psychiatry as a branch of medicine. There is manifestation of many social injustices to those incarcerated in the asylum in all three countries under consideration: England, USA, and Australia. It is demonstrated that social justice and human rights of their work forces were disregarded by many employers at the time of the Industrial Revolution. Such values were, therefore, unlikely to prevail with regard to the mentally ill. Asylumdom continued with few changes in its practices until after World War II. It is shown that the predominance of post Enlightenment theories, together with further politico-economic, social and pharmaceutical revolutionary change followed the Second World War. Encouraged also by the founding of the United Nations and World Health Organizations as well as provision of the Declaration of Human Rights, circumstances led to the process of de-institutionalization of the mentally ill. The latter were decanted with apparently unseemly haste into a community ill prepared for such a change, and with little evidence of infra- structure to support the move. Need to conduct a National Inquiry. There was, then, a need to investigate what was now an overt issue of mental health care. The two subsequent inquiries by the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, (AHMAC) and the Burdekin Report, both focused on social justice issues, and addressed epidemiological, economic, sociological and justice considerations. Within the thesis, both investigations are critiqued against a Natural Law model, using Finnis&#8217;s Natural Law theory. It is demonstrated that contrary to Enlightenment principles of social justice as described by Miller, such a theory is eminently practical, and answers the needs of all members of the community, providing not merely &#8216;the greatest happiness for the greatest number&#8217; but the common good of all Conclusion. Evidence shows that such a Natural Law theory is required to give a firm foundation to the needs of the mentally ill, especially at a time when relativism, economic rationalism and negative aspects of globalization prevail. Without such a basis the mentally ill are left insecure, uncertain and adrift in a world uncaring of their plight, while all the earnest exhortations espoused by Reports remain platitudes, subject to the whims of whatever government is in power. Our responsibilities to all our fellow human beings demand better from us than this.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Mental Health Care</field><field name="subject">Social justice</field><field name="subject">Human rights</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp113.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">My God, My God, Why Have You Abandoned Me? : The setting and rhetoric of Mark's Gospel</field><field name="creator">Incigneri, Brian</field><field name="description">This study proposes that the design of Mark's Gospel is best appreciated by recognising the particular political, social and religious situation that gave rise it, and by taking into account the concerns, experiences and emotions of both the author and the intended readers. It is argued that proposals for an Eastern provenance lack evidence and plausibility, and that the Gospel was written in Rome. The time of writing is identified as the latter months of 71, as the Gospel contains a number of indications that the Jerusalem Temple had been destroyed and that the Triumph of Vespasian and Titus in July/August 71 had recently occurred. Moreover, there are several allusions to events that had occurred within a year or two prior to that date. An investigation of the political and social situation shows that Christians had reason to be fearful, especially after the return of Titus. Through an examination of the rhetorical techniques contained within the text, it is proposed that the Gospel was a response to the protracted suffering of the Christians of Rome, addressing their doubts about God in the face of Roman power, their fear of further executions, and stresses within the community caused by apostasy and betrayal. Paying close attention to the mood of the text, an analysis of Mark's rhetoric shows how it responds to the readers' anxieties (including fear of delation), counters Flavian propaganda, and provides hope and strength. As appeals to the emotions were regarded as a key tool of ancient rhetoric, careful attention is paid to their use throughout the Gospel, showing that Mark produced a text full of pathos, matching the highly stressful atmosphere, and placing the readers' cries for help and prayers into the mouths of characters. In repeatedly stirring the readers' emotions by reminding them of their own painful experiences and by alluding to contemporary events and social attitudes, Mark explains why they are persecuted, and helps them to deal with their fear. He portrays Jesus as the one who had led the way by accepting martyrdom for the gospel in similar circumstances. He shapes many scenes to remind them of their Roman situation, especially the trials and executions of fellow Christians. Mark's rhetorical use of the disciples is also explored, showing that he aimed to elicit sympathy for those who had failed under pressure, which indicates that he was advocating their readmittance into the community. It is proposed that reading the Gospel as rhetoric addressed to this situation provides a quite different view of its nature, design and purposes, and gives a very different perspective to a number of debated issues within Markan scholarship.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gospel of Mark</field><field name="subject">Rhetorical Techniques</field><field name="subject">Roman Christians</field><field name="subject">Roman power</field><field name="subject">God</field><field name="subject">First century Roman political situation</field><field name="subject">First century Roman social situation</field><field name="subject">Early Christian Religion</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp6.19072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Factors Affecting Participation and Performance of Police Officers Undertaking the Queensland Police Service&#8217;s Management Development Program by Distance Education</field><field name="creator">Jack, Barbara Leigh</field><field name="description">Management education for police officers has played a significant role in the desired transformation of police services around the world from vocational to professional status. This thesis reports research that employed qualitative and quantitative data collection methods to investigate the factors affecting participation and performance of Queensland Police Service officers who undertook the Management Development Program by distance education mode. Three phases of data collection were employed. The first phase involved interviews with facilitators of the program about their perceptions of factors that affected participation and performance of officers enrolled in the program. Data from this phase were used to develop a questionnaire with seven internally consistent scales. This questionnaire constituted the second phase of data collection and was completed by officers at the ranks of senior constable, sergeant and senior sergeant who had successfully completed at least one unit of the Management Development Program. Data gained from the questionnaire were used to investigate the relationship between an officer's characteristics and the factors that influenced participation and performance in the Management Development Program. An analysis of these data provided the basis for the development of a schedule for interviews that were conducted with the manager of the program and the head of the School of Management. Central to these two interviews were implications for the delivery of the Management Development Program as part of the Queensland Police Service's continuing education and professional development program. These interviews constituted the third phase of data collection for this study. This study found factors that influenced the participation and performance of officers undertaking the program were their attitude to in-service professional development, how they perceived professional development, issues about their success potential, the level of personal, professional and academic support they received, the impact of aspects related to program delivery, and discourse with facilitators of the program. A model that provides a comprehensive representation of the relationships among the variables was developed. Key recommendations derived from this study have implications for the clinical delivery of the Management Development Program. Recommendations focus on the need to market the benefits of the program to individual officers, to provide enhanced student support services, to ensure the appropriateness of the learning materials, and to establish orientation programs and assignment-writing workshops for officers. Recommendations for the Queensland Police Service include the need to market the program&#8217;s importance to continuing education and professional development for officers as well as the program&#8217;s contribution to ensuring officers possessed sound management skills. Recommendations focussing on human resources include ensuring that numbers of facilitators are adequate to meet the learning needs of officers and that all facilitators possess appropriate postgraduate qualifications. It is also recommended that the postgraduate level of the Management Development Program be reviewed to determine if it is the most appropriate for the needs of officers and the service.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Professional development</field><field name="subject">Vocational education</field><field name="subject">Distance education</field><field name="subject">Police officers</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp83.04092006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship between Managers&#8217; Use of Power and Employees&#8217; Work Variables in Nationalised Commercial Banks in Bangladesh</field><field name="creator">Jahangir, Nadim</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates managers&#8217; use of power and its relationship to employees&#8217; organisational commitment and job satisfaction and any other potential factors influencing the relationship in Nationalised Commercial Banks (NCBs) in Bangladesh.  Earlier research focused only on employees&#8217; perceptions of managers&#8217; use of power in NCBs, and findings indicated a positive relationship between managers&#8217; use of power and employees&#8217; perceptions. The present research differs from the previous studies by linking managers' use of power with employees' organisational outcomes. The objective was to gain insights into ways in which the management of NCBs might use their power to enhance the levels of employees&#8217; commitment and job satisfaction.  Data were collected from several sources. Likert-type questionnaires were distributed to 600 employees in three NCBs and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 36 branch managers and four experts on banking. Complete questionnaires (in total 321) were included for data analysis using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and stepwise regression analysis. Both the bank managers and experts on banking interview transcripts were coded according to the interview schedule questions.  The findings indicated a relationship between managers&#8217; use of power and procedural justice, and employees&#8217; organisational commitment and job satisfaction in NCBs. In the quantitative findings no significant relationships were found between gender, age, and education level, and power, procedural justice, commitment, and job satisfaction. The qualitative findings, however, suggested that employees&#8217; age and education level were related to criterion variables; but the findings indicated there was no relationship between gender and criterion variables.  The results of this study provide insight into how the management of NCBs can enhance the level of their employees&#8217; commitment and job satisfaction. To improve managers&#8217; use of power and its relationships with employees&#8217; commitment and job satisfaction in NCBs in Bangladesh, there have to be changes at the individual and organisational levels. At the individual level improving managers&#8217; power bases would involve basic education and specific job-related training. Managers should also be encouraged to enhance their skills through continuous self-learning. At organisational level top management should provide appropriate reinforcements for managers in learning about and improving their power bases.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nationalised Commercial Banks</field><field name="subject">Employees&#8217; perceptions</field><field name="subject">Managers&#8217; use of power</field><field name="subject">Procedural justice</field><field name="subject">Job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp33.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spirituality in the Parochial and Plain Sermons of John Henry Newman</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Richard St Clair</field><field name="description">John Henry Newman was a renowned preacher especially in his years as an Anglican priest. This thesis aims to see what spiritual counsel he was preaching to his Anglican congregations and why he was so successful. For reasons of practicality it is limited to an examination of his principal collection of sermons, the eight volumes of Parochial and Plain Sermons which are pastoral sermons selected by Newman himself from those he delivered as an Anglican priest. It begins with some background on Newman himself and the religious context of England in the early 19th century. It also considers the basic principles of rhetorical skill. The discussion of the spirituality set out in the sermons begins with Newman&#8217;s presentation of God and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The thesis outlines his teaching on prayer, grace and the sacraments. It describes his emphasis on the unreality of this life and the prospect of immortality, the danger and evil of sin and the need for constant striving to do God&#8217;s will. It then lists the principal elements of behaviour of the true Christian, concluding with the Blessed Virgin Mary as the model of Christian behaviour. The final chapter cites the views of a range of authors on Newman&#8217;s effectiveness as a spiritual leader and identifies the elements which made him so successful as a preacher.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">John Henry Newman</field><field name="subject">Sermons</field><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Preaching</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp133.05022007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-Engaging Students in their Learning Through Middle School Reform: a case study evaluation of a vertically structured curriculum</field><field name="creator">Jones, Mellita M</field><field name="description">The phrase &#8220;middle schooling&#8221; refers to the school setting for adolescent students generally between the ages of 11 and 15 years of age (Lawton, 1999). This period of time has been recognized on a national level as being particularly significant in education. A call for reform in upper primary and lower secondary to address the understanding of adolescents in a complex and changing society has been recognized publicly at a federal and state level (Lawton, 1999). This research evaluates the redesign of one middle school&#8217;s structure through the implementation of a vertical curriculum in a catholic secondary college in a country town. The program has been in place for three years in the college and the need to evaluate it takes on significance for the college itself, and the wider educational community who have been discussing and researching middle school curriculum design for a number of years. Research methodology takes the form of attitudinal questionnaires administered to parents, students and staff in the college. Quantitative analysis using descriptive statistics is used for closed questions to look for significant differences between the parent, student and teacher attitude towards the philosophy and delivery of the vertical structure. One-way ANOVA and MANOVA analysis revealed that parents, students and staff were all supportive of the new structure and its driving philosophies, although parents scored significantly higher on the scales examined than staff or students. Correlations and Chi Square analysis were applied to selected scales, revealing overall that the outcomes of the vertical curriculum are being met. A number of areas were also identified as needing improvement, with areas of emphasis differing for the parent, staff and student groups in the community.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Middle school reform</field><field name="subject">Vertically structured curriculum</field><field name="subject">Catholic secondary college</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp84.25092005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Christian Parent Controlled Schools in Australia - a Study of the relationship between foundational values and prevailing practices</field><field name="creator">Justins, Charles Francis Roy</field><field name="description">Christian Parent Controlled (CPC) Schools, which commenced in the 1960s, are a relatively small, but growing component of the non-government schooling sector in Australia. In 2001, they enrolled over 22 000 students in 85 schools. Very little research has been conducted on the values and practices of CPC schools and while these schools frequently assert that they promote explicitly Christian values, their foundational values have not previously been identified or recorded.  This research identifies the key foundational values which are characteristic of these schools and examines the extent to which these values continue to influence the prevailing practices of these schools. Consideration is given to the implications of the relationship between foundational values and prevailing practices for the identity, development and leadership of CPC schools in Australia. The ability of these schools to articulate their foundational values and consider their prevailing practices in the light of these values should enhance their ability to understand their heritage, assess their current situation and plan their future.  The research found that in general, prevailing practices in these schools give faithful expression to the foundational values; however, the research also identified a number of areas where CPC schools struggle to engage consistently with these values.  As a result of this study, recommendations are proposed to assist national and school-based leadership in their strategic planning for the maintenance of these values and the future of these schools.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Christian parent controlled schools</field><field name="subject">Christian values</field><field name="subject">Foundational values</field><field name="subject">Independent schools</field><field name="subject">Non-government schools</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp20.16082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Christian Mission in Malaysia : Past emphasis, present engagement and future possibilities</field><field name="creator">Kana, Maria Perpetua</field><field name="description">The course of Christian mission in Malaysia spans a period of almost fivehundred years.

Such a role requires that experts work alongside professionals from a variety of different fields as well as creating the necessary knowledge and skills to solve the problems at hand. This thesis presents the outcomes of grounded research into the dynamics of expert work based on a case study of the scientific directors of accredited sports anti-doping laboratories. The study addressed questions about how both the directors and their stakeholders viewed the work of these scientific experts. It also investigated how these experts maintained their expertise in the rapidly changing context of doping in sport. The research design integrated the methods of case study, grounded theory and developmental work research. Qualitative data was elicited using a combination of standard qualitative research methods such as semi structured interviews, surveys and participant observation, and an adaptation of the activity theory based developmental work research methods. The results of data analysis were interpreted using the theoretical frameworks of Activity Theory, Communities of Practice and the complexity based Cynefin model of organic sensemaking. The subsequent development of a grounded theoretically informed model pointed to the existence of multiple objects for expert work and the critical role of a trusted, private, shared space for the development of individual and collective identities, the expansion and application of validated knowledge within the field and the establishment of a shared and informed base from which experts can engage with other professional groups working in the field. The model identified relationships between the volume of routine processes within a workplace and both the extent of knowledge-generating research work and the development of an awareness by experts of the benefits of greater participation with other stakeholders in the broader problem context. This international study also provided insights into the complex, evolving and emergent nature of multi-stakeholder activity and identified avenues for further research into the optimum dynamics of inter-agency working in both local and global contexts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Expertise</field><field name="subject">Expert work</field><field name="subject">Sports anti-doping laboratories</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp142.08052008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Learning Environment in the Extended Practicum of a Pre-Service Teacher Education Course at a Catholic University</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis reports research which employed quantitative data collection methods to investigate pre-service teacher perceptions of extended practicum learning environments of pre-service teachers at a Catholic university and their self-efficacy for future teaching. By drawing on learning environment research, practicum in teacher education literature, student teacher practicum evaluation data and stakeholder perceptions of dimensions of the ACU extended practicum learning environment, an instrument, a 72-item questionnaire, the Extended Practicum Learning Environment Inventory (EPLEI) was developed and validated. To establish relationships between student teacher perceptions of the extended practicum learning environment and their self-efficacy for future teaching, a Student Teacher Efficacy Instrument (STEI) was also developed. Data were collected from student teachers using the EPLEI and the STEI. In 2001, the total sample consisted of 64 students. Recognising that there are a number of dimensions to the learning environments of the extended practicum and to assess differences in student teacher and supervising teacher perceptions of the same extended practicum learning environment, supervising teachers responded to an analogous form of the EPLEI. In 2002, the sample consisted of 57 student teachers and their supervising teachers. Statistical analyses were performed on the quantitative data and revealed some statistically significant differences in the way student teachers and supervising teachers perceive the same environment. Statistical analyses also revealed significant differences in student teachers perceptions of extended practicum environments in relation to school type. Student teachers who participated in the extended practicum in Catholic schools perceived the learning environments more positively than student teachers in State and Other Christian schools. The analyses revealed significant associations between student teacher perceptions of the extended practicum learning environments and their self-efficacy for future teaching.

It addresses the issue of the nature and purpose of Catholic schools in situ, the focus of the research being an in-depth analytical description of the participant school. Consequently, the findings are of potential relevance to those interested in the issue of the nature and purpose of the Catholic school in situ from a general and holistic perspective.  Specifically, given the concern of the research with the nature and purpose of a Catholic school in situ, two anticipated areas of focus for the study were identified. These were the defining features of the school, in relation to the concern of the study with the nature of the school, and the ends of the school, in relation to the concern of the study with the purpose of the school. The study was thus governed by 2 two-part general research questions.  1. What are the defining features of the school, and how are they maintained?  2. To what ends is the school oriented, and how is this orientation sustained?  In the form of an ethnographic study, the research describes and interprets the participant school from the perspective of those who constitute the day-to-day community.  The findings of the study are located within a contextual understanding involving historical and prescriptive perspectives for, and literature pertaining to, the contemporary Catholic school.  Given the concern of the ethnography with the development, as opposed to the verification, of theory, data gathered from five major sources over the period of a school  Section headings for the Introduction through to the References have necessarily been deleted for electronic presentation.  Likewise, page numbers have necessarily been deleted for electronic presentation. year were focused and analysed, through the method of grounded theory, to arrive at the findings of the study. These five sources were participant-observation, in-depth interviews conducted with a number of the school personnel, observation of various school meetings, school documents, and a survey of the student body.  The findings of the study, in their descriptive and analytical dimensions, are presented in four chapters. Specifically, these are presented in Chapters Five through to Eight, in relation to four main organising principles pertaining (a) to the description of the school, (b) to predominant perspectives on the school from within its day-to-day community, (c) to the prevailing characteristics upon which the perspectives of the day-today community turn, and (d) to the theoretical construct consequent upon the description, the predominant perspectives, and the prevailing characteristics. As with the descriptive aspect, to which the first two organising principles predominantly pertain, the interpretive dimension of the findings is largely undertaken in two chapters. The first of these chapters (i.e., Chapter Seven), pertaining to the delineation of the prevailing features evident within the perspectives of the day-to-day community, provides an interpretation of the descriptive findings in terms of an autocratic hegemony, a managerial administrative focus, and a bureaucratic organisational culture. Thus, this chapter signifies the primary analysis of the findings of the two previous chapters through completion of the descriptive dimension.  The second of these chapters (i.e., Chapter Eight) places this preliminary analysis of the descriptive findings within a theoretical construct pertaining to concepts of disparity and congruity, opposition and compliance. The concepts of disparity and congruity relate to the school's adherence to ideological and primitive imperatives respectively. Those of opposition and compliance relate to the degrees of consonance, within the day-to-day community, in terms of assent to the prevailing order within the school. Consequently, it is to be observed that the elements of description and interpretation, essential to the in-depth analytical description demanded of the ethnographic methodological approach, decrease and increase, respectively, across these four chapters.  Section headings for the Introduction through to the References have necessarily been deleted for electronic presentation.  Likewise, page numbers have necessarily been deleted for electronic presentation.  The study concluded that the nature and purpose of the school were consequent upon its prevailing autocratic hegemony, its pre-eminently managerial administrative focus, and its profoundly bureaucratic organisational culture. These interconnected elements of the school's practices, disparate from the ideological imperatives advocated for the Catholic school, were found to effect a latent opposition within the school community, principally in relation to the teaching personnel, masked by the overall compliance of the day-to-day community with the prevailing order.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Victorian Catholic secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Catholic school characteristics</field><field name="subject">Catholic school goals</field><field name="subject">Catholic school management</field><field name="subject">Ethnography</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp46.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into the Relationship between Total Quality Management Practice and Performance in a Taiwan Public Hospital</field><field name="creator">Lai, Mei-Chiao</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the relationship between Total Quality Management (TQM) practice and hospital performance from 1997 t0 2001 in a Taiwan public hospital.  In Taiwan, previous research focused on TQM practice and hospital performance in the manufacturing sector. Earlier research relevant to hospitals emphasised outcomes, such as hospital efficiency. The current study differs from the previous hospital research by examining comprehensive organisational performance, including financial and non-financial performance. The objective was to gain insights into ways in which the managers of hospitals might use the findings to enhance the hospital performance levels.  The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) 2001 health care criteria for performance excellence were used as a research instrument to measure TQM practice and hospital performance. Data were collected using triangulation method, that is a self-assessment questionnaire, focus group interviews and documentation that is Government Annual Reports. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and Multiple Regression Analysis were utilised to analyse data from questionnaires. Findings from focus group interviews were coded and categorised. Findings from documentation were used to verify and validate the progress of hospital performance.  The quantitative findings indicated that the demographic characteristics of employees had no significant impact on TQM practice, nor on hospital performance. Elements of TQM, however, were important determinants of overall hospital performance, the more committed the TQM practice, the better the hospital performance. The qualitative findings indicated that, for Hospital A, effective TQM would be accomplished through incremental organisational change.  This research makes a contribution to both academic knowledge and hospital practice. It bridges the research gap in the relationship between TQM practice and hospital performance and also offers a solid foundation for future academic research. The study also provides short and long-term recommendations about quality improvement to both the manager and hospital A.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Total Quality Management (TQM)</field><field name="subject">Public hospital</field><field name="subject">Organisational performance</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA)</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp34.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why Bother to be a Student Leader? An Exploration of the school experiences and self-perceptions of Year 12 students in three Catholic schools</field><field name="creator">Lavery, Shane</field><field name="description">The focus of this research was Year 12 student leadership in three Catholic schools. Pivotal to the thesis were the leadership experiences and self-perceptions of the schools&#8217; Year 12 students. Two theoretical propositions underscored the study: all Year 12 students are called to some form of leadership within their school; and schools should strive to build a leadership culture inclusive of all Year 12 students. The review of the literature drew attention to three themes which formed the conceptual framework underpinning the research, namely organisational leadership, Christian leadership and its meaning for the Catholic School, and student leadership. In the light of the review it seemed appropriate that the conduct of the study should be predominantly qualitative, interpretive, and planned around collective case study. For each of the three case study schools, data collection took the form of a document search, an interview with a key informant staff member, a Year 12 student survey questionnaire utilising both qualitative and quantitative questions, and two Year 12 student focus group interviews. The &#8220;general analytic strategy&#8221; (Yin, 1994, p. 30) employed in this research was to follow the theoretical propositions underlying this study which, in turn, reflected a set of seven research questions. Findings from the study indicated that there was a strong belief among senior students from the three schools that every Year 12 student should have the opportunity to participate in leadership. Furthermore, students saw leadership as entailing duty, a sense of service, as well as involvement with younger students. Students also highlighted a range of benefits associated with leadership participation, as well as certain pressures, notably the need to balance study commitments with leadership responsibilities, and the demands of having to be a role model &#8220;all the time&#8221;.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Year 12 students</field><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Self-perception</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp35.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teenage Boys&#8217; Perceptions of the Influence of Teachers and School Experiences on their Understanding of Masculinity</field><field name="creator">Lee, John Robert</field><field name="description">There is widespread interest shown in the education of boys in school as evidenced in research, education initiatives and discussion in the general community. Research undertaken by Connell (1989, 1995, 1996, 2000), Laberge and Albert (1999), Mac an Ghaill (1994), Martino (1998), West (1999, 2002) and others suggests that there is a range of masculinities displayed by teenage boys. Some of the masculinities with which boys identify are in conflict with accepted ideas of educational achievement. This doctoral study investigates the contribution of teachers and school experiences to teenage boys&#8217; understanding of masculinity. There are two components to the study. The first part is a systematic review of the literature to highlight findings about boys&#8217; perceptions of relationships between masculinity and schooling. The second part is a qualitative empirical study of the views of a sample of Year 11 high school boys in two single sex Catholic schools. The interviews focus on their understandings of masculinity and their perceptions of influential aspects of school life. It includes an analysis of the boys' views of the impact of teachers, sport, discipline and classroom experiences.  Participants in the study indicated that masculinity is changing and the community is requiring men to be more expressive of emotions. The majority of teenage boys interviewed stated that teachers and school experiences influenced their understanding of masculinity. Pupil - teacher relationships, conversations, exhortations and non-verbal communications are all perceived as means by which teachers influence students. Some teachers were regarded as good role models, making a positive contribution the boys&#8217; masculinity. Interviewees reported that the schools promoted two masculinities, &#8216;sporting&#8217; and &#8216;academic&#8217;. They spoke of contrasting interpretations of the appropriate expression of emotion. One finding of the study is that some of the teenage boys experienced a &#8216;spirituality of connected masculinity&#8217; through singing, cheering and participation in school activities including sport, liturgies and retreats.  Implications are drawn from the study and recommendations are made for improving the education of boys including how schools can encourage a diversity of &#8216;reflective&#8217; masculinities rather than reinforcing &#8216;hegemonic&#8217; understandings of masculinity.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teachers</field><field name="subject">Teenage boys</field><field name="subject">Masculinity</field><field name="subject">School experience</field><field name="subject">Single sex Catholic schools</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp36.29082005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching Pronunciation of English Using Computer Assisted Learning Software: An Action Research Study in an Institute of Technology in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Lee, Su Tseng</field><field name="description">This research investigated how the characteristics of two Computer Assisted Langauge Learning (CALL) programs assisted Taiwanese students learning English pronunciation, how the different types of feedback in the program helped them to learn English pronunciation effectively, and how teachers may effectively integrate such computer software into their teaching. The purpose of the study was to define directions for pedagogy and research in CALL in Taiwan, drawing on the perceptions of Taiwanese college students and their teacher in regard to the effectiveness of the selected programs and their feedback functions. This research sought to explore ways to develop and improve English pronunciation learning in Taiwan by using another tool in addition to teacher-directed learning. It is anticipated that the research will provide Taiwanese language teachers with information about how to supplement their teacher directed language teaching, and about what learning tools are effective for this. In all, one teacher/researcher and 153 college students across four classes took part in this research project, and the setting was in an Institute of Technology in Taiwan. The students all used the two computer software programs separately in a computer laboratory for several weeks, and their perspectives about the effectiveness of the programs and the feedback they gave were gathered. The research methodology was action research, and it used an open-ended questionnaire and participant observation for collecting data, as well as content analysis for the interpretation of the data. In addition, the students wrote learning sheets which aimed to focus their learning. The results showed that the students preferred the program with explicit correction feedback, and with repetition and other specific functions, as well as the facility for selfpaced and self-directed learning. The key finding of the study was that in Taiwan, when used alongside the traditional classroom teaching, CALL is a tool which has the potential to address some of the issues English pronunciation teachers face, such as low student motivation and low English pronunciation proficiency. A number of recommendations are made for the effective use of CALL. Students gave several detailed suggestions in regard to the computer software functions which could help them to learn more effectively, and the teacher also addressed some issues which need to be considered when using CALL computer software to assist students&#8217; learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language pronunciation</field><field name="subject">Computer assisted learning</field><field name="subject">Taiwanese education</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp174.16092008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Harry Potter and the Quest for Values: How the boy wizard can assist young people in making choices</field><field name="creator">Lennard, Anthony</field><field name="description">The Harry Potter series has been a phenomenal publishing success for their author J. K. Rowling. This thesis argues for the use of these books as a worthwhile teaching asset, especially in the promotion of values in our schools. It particularly focuses on the use of these books for Values Education in the curriculum area of Religious Education. While the world continues to change and evolve there are some aspects of our societies that remain unchanged and the power of stories is one of these stable forces. This thesis looks at the importance of stories in teaching our youth about values, especially Christian values. It also provides research on how critics and youth have responded to the stories about Harry Potter through undertaking a review of critical comments and by actually asking young people what they feel about aspects of the novels. Comment is made on what Christian values can be found in the Harry Potter series and how they are shown through the choices characters make. This thesis also looks at how the power to choose is a fundamental basis of Christian religion and that through our choices we live out our humanity. Mention is made of Values Education in both State and Catholic schools and how, in recent years, we have seen increased moves by both Federal and State Governments to instigate Values Education programmes in Australian schools. This study also looked at how curriculum changes in Tasmania, at both State and Catholic levels, encourages the teaching of values through the use of resources that connect with our young people and teaching strategies that encourage higher-order thinking skills. An analysis is also made regarding the connection between the Harry Potter series and the hero journey motif. This connection provides some answers as to why the series is so popular and why our youth feel some connection to the characters in the books.Through research and analysis this thesis found that the Harry Potter series is popular with our youth and that they are connected to the characters in the books and the choices they make. This study also found that the series, through the characters and choices they make, provides itself as a valuable teaching tool because it is able to be used in both secular and Catholic schools regardless of attacks on the books by Christian groups. Studies undertaken indicated that the values presented in the books are compatible with our Australian societal values and that with the use of good teaching strategies the books can assist students in developing their higher-order thinking skills. The Harry Potter series can be used to assist youth in acquiring values that will assist them in their personal development and to help them become useful contributors to our modern world. Through the character of Harry Potter and his experiences students can learn more about themselves and the values they need to overcome those difficulties that they, like all of us, face in life.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Harry Potter</field><field name="subject">Values Education</field><field name="subject">Religious Education</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp149.26072007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memorization and Improvisation: a Comparison of Two Strategies in the Oral Acquisition of English as a Second Language</field><field name="creator">Liu, Wen-chung</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of two teaching strategies, memorization and improvisation, on ESL (English as a second language) students&#8217; oral proficiency and how they perceived the strategies and the activities used in the classroom. Participants were 16-year-old nursing students in a Taiwan medical college. They had learned English for at least three and a half years before joining the study, but most of their previous learning was focused on reading and writing. They were divided into three groups, experiencing a memorization strategy, an improvisation strategy, and a strategy combining memorization and improvisation respectively. Data were collected from their oral pre-test and post-test, perception questionnaire, perception interview, college-wide satisfaction survey and in-class observation. Data were analysed in both quantitative and qualitative ways. The results showed that each of the strategies had significant positive effects on students&#8217; oral acquisition, but the improvisation group performed significantly better than the memorization group, and the memorization group did better than the combination group. However, the satisfaction and perception surveys showed that participants preferred the combination strategy to the improvisation strategy, and the improvisation strategy was preferred to the memorization strategy. The finding also showed that participants&#8217; initial oral language levels made no difference on the rate of oral improvement. The high-level and intermediate students demonstrated no difference in their preference for the two strategies, but the low-level students showed significant preference for the memorization strategy. In terms of the teaching activities, participants preferred task-based activities to discussion activities, and activities involving multiple people were preferred to monologues such as storytelling and news reports. Nevertheless, preference made no difference on participants&#8217; oral improvement. Based upon the insight gained from this study, pedagogical implications and for teaching oral language were developed and suggestions for future research have been recommended.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taiwanese education</field><field name="subject">English as a second language</field><field name="subject">Oral acquisition</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp124.25102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Response of Elderly Female Fast Gait to Whole Body Vibration</field><field name="creator">Lorenzen, Hans Christian</field><field name="description">Background: Older adults walk more slowly than healthy young adults at fast and normal walking speeds. These age-associated changes in mobility impact upon daily function. A slower gait, for example, may reduce the older adult&#8217;s ability to safely cross at traffic intersections due to the time restriction. Recent research has demonstrated whole body vibration (WBV) can improve the strength and power (Roelants, Delecluse &amp; Verschueren, 2004; Russo et al., 2003; Verschueren, Roelants, Delecluse, Swinnen, Vanderschueren &amp; Boonen, 2004) of community dwelling elderly females, and the mobility of nursing home residents (Bautmans, Van Hees, Lemper &amp; Mets, 2005; Bruyere et al., 2005). To date, no published research has examined the impact WBV has on the gait parameters of community dwelling elderly females. The research was conducted in three phases. Phase One &#8211; Development of a WBV Platform: This phase outlines the development of a WBV platform (ACUWBV) that was designed and built for this research. A unique aspect of the ACUWBV was the method of adjusting WBV amplitude and therefore intensity. Current WBV technology, using tilting oscillations, requires the individual to increase their stance width. The ACUWBV allowed for the adjustment of WBV amplitude while maintaining the same stance width. The reliability and accuracy of the ACUWBV eccentric cam was measured during this phase of the research. Although an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.4 was calculated and is considered an indication of low reliability, calculations of typical error (TE -95% error range) for each amplitude indicated the error to be small in the overall precision of the instrument. Specifically, at a frequency of 20 Hz, the expected WBV acceleration ranges for amplitudes of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm were 7.58 m.s-2 to 8.85 m.s-2 (TE = 0.02 mm) and 16.90 m.s-2 to 17.53 m.s.-2 (TE = 0.01 mm), respectively. Phase Two &#8211; Pilot Study: This phase established the response of elderly community-dwelling female fast gait to WBV. Seven elderly female participants attended three WBV sessions per week for three weeks. Participants performed fast walks over an electronic walkway (GAITRite) at the end of each WBV session. A time-series graph displayed a linear increase in stride velocity over the three week intervention period. Conversely, stride time, stance time and double support time exhibited linear decreases. However, stride time (p=0.04) and stance time (p=0.04) were the only variables that exhibited a significant difference. It was concluded that the linear changes in stride velocity, stride time, stance time and double support time warranted further investigation with a larger sample size within a longer intervention period. Phase Three &#8211; Major Study: Phase three was an extension of phase two. This WBV intervention study was performed over a twelve week period. Twenty-two elderly female participants were placed in one of two groups. Group one (placebo/WBV; Group; n=12) was exposed to a placebo intervention for the first six weeks followed by a six week WBV intervention. Group two (Group WBV/placebo; n=10) was exposed to WBV for the first six weeks and a placebo intervention for the following six weeks. Group placebo/WBV exhibited no change in stride velocity during the placebo period, but a seven per cent increase during the six week WBV period (p=0.005). The changes in stride velocity coincided with increases in stride length (p=0.017), and reductions in stride time (p=0.007), stance time (p=0.001) and double support time (p=0.001). Group WBV/Placebo demonstrated stride velocity to increase by five per cent during the WBV period. Although the time-series graphs demonstrated improvements in stride velocity to be associated with decreases in stride time, stance time, and double support time, the changes failed to reach significance. Single support time and stride length showed no change over the WBV period. The improvements shown by group WBV/placebo from the first six weeks of WBV were maintained during the six week placebo (detraining) period. In summary, WBV was an effective intervention for enhancing the walking speed of community dwelling elderly female gait. This form of exercise may have positive outcomes on the daily function of elderly females, which in turn may improve their quality of life.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Walking gait</field><field name="subject">Older adults</field><field name="subject">Whole body vibration</field><field name="subject">Elderly females</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp154.30052008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of adults with advanced hiv/aids referred to community nurses</field><field name="creator">Lucey, Adrienne</field><field name="description">Community nurses have a critical role in caring for people and families affected by HIV/AIDS in the home setting. Despite this, there is a dearth of Australian literature describing the health needs of these clients who are referred to them. This study identified the demographic, clinical and psychoemotional aspects of adult clients with HIV/AIDS in Sydney, Australia, who were referred to community nurses and died between 1993 and 1995. Retrospective data from the records of 73 clients identified on 171 Community Nursing Referral Forms completed within the study period from an inpatient HIV/AIDS Unit was analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. The sample was demographically similar to the general population of people with HIV/AIDS during the study period. The most commonly identified clinical aspects of clients included oral candida, mycobacterium avium complex, anaemia, drug intolerance, cytomegalovirus, pain, fever, diarrhoea, weight loss and cough. The most commonly identified psychoemotional variables were depressed mood, anxiety, grief and nonadherence to suggested interventions, with the most common emergent theme being the physical effects of HIV/AIDS illness. Emotional support, symptom monitoring and home assessments were the most common requests made of community nurses. The study sample represented 14% of people who died following AIDS in New South Wales during this known peak period of AIDS diagnoses and deaths following AIDS. As a result of this study, documentation exists describing the characteristics of clients with advanced HIV/AIDS referred to community nurses. Current and future clients with advanced HIV/AIDS referred to community nurses may experience a similar clinical picture to that identified in this study. The findings can be used to reveal relationships amongst the key variables; lay the foundation for further comparative, theory or hypothesis driven studies; and demonstrate how this influences the community nursing role, strategies, interventions and outcomes.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community nurses</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS clients-Demographic characteristics</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS clients-Clinical characteristics</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS clients-Psychoemotional characteristics</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp7.25072005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catholicism, History and Culture: A Dawsonian synthesis</field><field name="creator">Lynch, Michael Richard</field><field name="description">At present the Church is confronted by two major problems, specifically, its marginalization within Western society, and the difficulty of transmitting the faith to the young. This confusion has had a particularly severe impact on Catholics within English-speaking countries such as Australia, where a dominant secularized Protestant culture has repudiated its Catholic roots. Catholics have had limited opportunities to appreciate the depth and richness of their heritage or to understand the forms and substance of a flourishing Catholic culture. There have been two major responses to the dilemma of the Church&#8217;s interaction with modern culture. The first, which predominated before 1960, drew largely upon neo-scholastic philosophy, a major proponent of which was the prominent French Catholic intellectual, Jacques Maritain (1882-1973). However, a sole reliance on this approach has proved unsatisfactory in countries such as Australia, where the Catholic cultural and historical understandings remained underdeveloped. The second major response, which has dominated the period since the Second Vatican Council (1962-65), has interpreted the term aggiornamento to mean accommodation by the Church to the modern world. This response has been particularly problematic for Catholics in Australia, which has experienced substantial social and cultural changes in the last forty years. Consequently, major declines in religious practice and the marginalization of Christian understandings and beliefs within the broader society are indicative of a need for new ways to respond to modern culture and the challenge of secularization. Since the early 1970s, Communio scholars have explored the relationship between theology and culture. Their perspectives have also led to a renewed awareness of the importance of tradition, memory and history in understanding culture. This thesis will build on this renewed awareness, to argue that the confusion about the r&#244;le of culture has resulted from a failure to recognize the challenge posed by modernity&#8217;s breach with the Christian past, and the accompanying distortion of the historical narrative. A solution to these difficulties draws upon the historical and cultural understandings of the English Catholic historian, Christopher Dawson (1889-1970). He sought to emphasize the essential quality of the spiritual dimension in culture and history. In particular, Dawson&#8217;s understanding that religion forms culture gave him a unique insight into the importance of memory and tradition in the survival of a culture. Thus, his work addressed such themes as the r&#244;le of Christianity in forming the West, and the need to analyse the forms and substance of a Christian culture. During the 1950s, Dawson became increasingly convinced of the importance of education in transmitting the spiritual and cultural heritage of society. He advocated the idea of a Christian culture course that would teach students about their Christian past and help them to understand that religion provides the most vital aspect of society. In particular, this thesis will propose that Dawson&#8217;s historical and educational framework is an important way to respond to the amnesia of modern culture and to transmit the faith to the next generation. Specifically, this thesis will use the Dawsonian perspective as well as the cultural analysis of the Communio school, as a means to focus on the importance of culture, history, the European heritage and education, in order to argue for new catechetical and educational directions. A focus on Europe would benefit Australia not only because it has a European heritage, but because it would allow a greater knowledge of a culture that was formed by Christianity, and of the challenge that arises from a secularization of the Christian ethos. The Dawsonian proposal for a Christian culture course provides an alternative to historical and cultural perspectives that are based on secular and Whig versions of history. Instead of focusing on the three-fold division of history into Ancient, Medieval and Modern eras, Dawson&#8217;s course developed an understanding of the impact of Christianity by developing a knowledge of six stages of Christian culture: The Apostolic Age; the Patristic Age; the Formation of Western Christendom; the High Middle Ages; Divided Christendom, after the Reformation; and finally, Secularized Christendom. Thus, the Dawsonian course with its emphasis on the formative r&#244;le of Christian culture within Western society is an important means to address the problems of the marginalization of the Church, and the urgent need to find more effective ways to transmit the faith to the next generation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholicism</field><field name="subject">Christopher Dawson</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp176.07102008</field></doc></add>
