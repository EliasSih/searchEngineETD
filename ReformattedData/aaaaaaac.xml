Commercial Entertainment Cinema</field><field name="creator">Brown, James</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the historically composed political and economic contexts that contributed to the late 1990s commercial renaissance of Korean national cinema and that have sustained the popularity of Korean films among local and regional audiences ever since. Unlike existing approaches to the topic, which emphasise the textual characteristics of national film production, this thesis considers relations between film production, distribution, exhibition, and ancillary markets, as well as Korean cinema&#146;s engagement with international cinemas such as Hollywood, Hong Kong, China and Japan. I argue that following the relaxation of restrictive film policy towards the importation and distribution of foreign films between 1986 and 1988, the subsequent failure of the domestic film industry to compete against international competition precipitated a remarkable shift in consensus regarding the industry&#146;s structure and functions. Due to the loss of distribution rights to foreign films and the rapid decline in ticket sales for Korean films, the continued economic viability of local film companies was under enormous threat by the early 1990s. The government reacted by permitting conglomerates to seize control of the industry and pursue vertical and horizontal integration. During the rest of the decade, Korean cinema was transformed from an art cinema to a commercial entertainment cinema. The 1997/98 economic crisis led to the exit of conglomerate finance, but streamlined film companies were able to withstand the monetary meltdown, continue the domestic revitalisation, and, since the late 1990s, build media empires based on the expansion of Korean cinema throughout the Asian region.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motion picture</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">korea</field><field name="subject">south korea</field><field name="subject">film production</field><field name="subject">film distribution</field><field name="subject">film exhibition</field><field name="subject">screen quota</field><field name="subject">korean new wave</field><field name="subject">new korean cinema</field><field name="subject">multiplex</field><field name="subject">CJ Entertainment</field><field name="subject">Cinema Service</field><field name="subject">Mediaplex</field><field name="subject">Lotte Cinema</field><field name="subject">regionalisation</field><field name="subject">venture capital</field><field name="subject">home video</field><field name="subject">cable television</field><field name="subject">pay television</field><field name="subject">chaebol</field><field name="subject">vertical integration</field><field name="subject">economic crisis</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20071122.143238</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STORE OPERATED Ca2+ CHANNELS IN LIVER CELLS: REGULATION BY BILE ACIDS AND A SUB-REGION OF THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM</field><field name="creator">Castro Kraftchenko, Joel</field><field name="description">Cholestasis is an important liver pathology. During cholestasis bile acids accumulate in the bile canaliculus affecting hepatocyte viability. The actions of bile acids require changes in the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and in Ca2+ entry. The target(s) of the Ca2+ entry pathway affected by bile acids is, however, not known. The overall objective of the work described in this thesis was to elucidate the target(s) and mechanism(s) of bile acids-induced modulation of hepatocytes calcium homeostasis.
First, it was shown that a 12 h pre-incubation with cholestatic bile acids (to mimic cholestasis conditions) induced the inhibition of Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs), while the addition of choleretic bile acids to the incubation medium caused the reversible activation of Ca2+ entry through SOCs. Moreover, it was shown that incubation of liver cells with choleretic bile acids counteracts the inhibition of Ca2+ entry caused by pre-incubation with cholestatic bile acids. Thus, it was concluded that SOCs are the target of bile acids action in liver cells.
Surprisingly, despite the effect of choleretic bile acids in activating SOCs, the Ca2+ dye fura-2 failed to detect choleretic bile acid-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. However, under the same conditions, when the sub-plasma membrane Ca2+ levels were measured using FFP-18 Ca2+ dye, choleretic bile acid induced a transient increase in FFP-18 fluorescence. This evidence suggested that choleretic bile acids-induced activation of Ca2+ entry through SOCs, involving the release of Ca2+ from a region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) located in the vicinity of the plasma membrane.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liver cells</field><field name="subject">Store Operated Calcium Channels</field><field name="subject">Bile Acids</field><field name="subject">Endoplasmic Reticulum</field><field name="subject">STIM1</field><field name="subject">Orai1</field><field name="subject">TRPV1</field><field name="subject">Fura-2</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080826.135311</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young People and Politics: Apathetic and Disengaged? A Qualitative Inquiry</field><field name="creator">Manning, Nathan Paul</field><field name="description">This thesis is an examination of the prominent discourse which claims young people are apathetic and disengaged from politics. It is argued that this discourse is based upon two faulty conceptual assumptions, firstly, that youth is a period of linear transition to adulthood, and secondly, that the discourse unreflexively applies an unproblematised notion of politics which has its origin in the eighteenth century Scottish Enlightenment. The research used in-depth qualitative interviews to explore the ways in which young people operating across the political spectrum understand and practice politics. These qualitative findings add to existing studies of young people and politics, which are predominantly quantitative in approach. The findings suggest that the Scottish Enlightenment&#146;s narrow, regulatory, liberal model of politics is the hegemonic model of politics for participants. However, this hegemony is challenged by participants&#146; own &#145;political&#146; practices, the collapse of liberalism&#146;s public/private divide under conditions of late modernity, and an interconnected sense of self. Moreover, contrary to the discourse of apathetic and disengaged youth, that there are a number of ways of understanding and practicing politics, particularly in light of social processes &#150; such as individualisation, new social movements, and consumerism &#150; driving recent social change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Young People</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">Qualitative Research</field><field name="subject">Young People and Politics</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070903.180304</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Synthesis and Characterisation of Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane Bound Chromophores</field><field name="creator">Clarke, David John</field><field name="description">This research involved the synthesis and characterisation of a range of optically active polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) compounds.
POSS precursor compounds containing functional groups required for subsequent attachment of the desired functional groups have been synthesised. Examples of such precursor compounds include mono-functionalised POSS compounds with periphery aldehyde, azide, amino and pyridyl functional groups.
A variety of POSS compounds, functionalised with a range of optical functionalities, including optical limiters such as fulleropyrrolidine and iminofullerene, and dyes and pigments, including naphthalene, biphenyl, perylene, pyrene and porphyrin have been synthesised.
The reaction of mono-functionalised POSS aldehydes with fullerene (C60) in the presence of N-methylglycine yielded the desired POSS fulleropyrrolidines, whilst reaction of mono-functionalised POSS azide with C60 yielded POSS iminofullerenes. All POSS fullerene compounds were characterised by power limiting measurements, exhibiting comparable power limiting to that of parent C60.
The microwave condensation of mono-amino POSS with a range of mono- and bis-anhydrides yielded the POSS imide compounds, which were characterised by UV-Vis and fluorescence spectrophotometry. The perylene POSS imide derivative was further characterised by single crystal x-ray crystallography. The naphtha and biphenyl POSS imides exhibited extremely weak fluorescence, whilst the perylene

POSS imide displayed particularly strong fluorescence, with a quantum yield approaching unity.
The incorporation of a pyridyl group on the periphery of a mono-functionalised POSS cage allowed for the synthesis of the first porphyrin functionalised POSS compound. Mono-porphyrin POSS exhibited comparable absorption properties to other pyridyl ligated ruthenium porphyrins.
Mono-functionalised pyrene POSS compounds were prepared through the reaction of 1-pyrene acid chloride with mono(3-aminopropyl)POSS. This synthetic pathway offered a convenient route to mono-functionalised pyrene POSS, in preference to the multi-substitution associated with Heck coupling.

This has created unprecedented challenges for the international community since the amount of assistance has had to increase and resources have had to be diverted from development programs in countries with serious economic and social problems.
The current study addressed important issues related to refugees with disabilities living in the Dadaab Refugee Camp Complexes in Kenya. After a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of the major study, 200 individuals with a disability were interviewed, and focus group discussions were held with individuals and groups supporting people with disabilities. 
The study was guided by the following research objectives:
1.	To determine the prevalence of disability among Somali refugees and clarify the concept of disability as it relates to the Somali community;
2.	To identify and discuss the nature and the causes of disability among the Somali refugees in Kenya;
3.	To gain a picture of the basic needs, aspirations, and challenges of Somali refugees with a disability;
4.	To examine and evaluate the prevailing educational and rehabilitation approaches to disability in the context of Somali refugees in Kenya; and
5.	To develop a framework for a comprehensive approach to community rehabilitation relevant to refugees with a disability in Kenya.
The research found that, while war in Somalia and related factors have contributed significantly to disability amongst members of the Somali community, cultural mindsets perpetuate disability and undermine the existing efforts to alleviate the conditions that people experience. Education and rehabilitation, which would be viable means of addressing the issues associated with disability, are inadequate in the refugee camps. The study acknowledges the efforts made by international agencies to help and support people with disabilities. However, it notes that more needs to be done if the Somali refugees with disability are to live dignified and functional human lives.
This study draws the following conclusions:
&#149;	Although war in Somalia is, reportedly, the main actual cause of disability among the Somali refugees in the Dadaab camps in Kenya, culturally, curses are considered to have led to disabilities by major sections of the Somali community.
&#149;	The concept of disability as culturally and socially constructed is inadequate. Consequently, in order to address disability effectively, these cultural constructions need to be carefully evaluated and transformed.
&#149;	The current efforts aimed at assisting refugees with disability are commendable but there is a need to improve the educational and rehabilitation approaches used to provide services to refugees with disability. The community rehabilitation approach would seem to offer the best opportunities for assisting to engage and support the empowerment and acceptance of refugees with disabilities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">refugees</field><field name="subject">Somalia</field><field name="subject">Kenya</field><field name="subject">Dadaab Camps</field><field name="subject">Community Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080904.150115</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Housing for people 
with a psychiatric disability;
community empowerment, 
partnerships and politics</field><field name="creator">Battams, Samantha Jane</field><field name="description">This research examined intersectoral relationships and community participation in policy processes across the mental health and housing sectors. The focus was on the development of suitable housing options for people with a psychiatric disability.  The study period covered five years of mental health system reform in South Australia (2000-2005). The research found a shortage of housing and support options for people with psychiatric disability and lack of significant strategic policy coordination or ongoing cross-sectoral programmes. The problems faced by people in gaining access to housing and disability support services and the ways in which families provide housing or support in the absence of public services are documented.
This case study used qualitative research methods which were triangulated across four stages: 1) a thematic analysis of national and state policies in the health, housing and disability sectors; 2) participant observation of NGO activity, a thematic analysis of NGO documents, and interviews and focus groups with NGOs; 3) interviews and focus groups with consumer and carer representatives and a thematic analysis of the minutes from state-level groups; 4) interviews with professionals from the health, housing and disability sectors 
The housing situation for people with psychiatric disability was explained in terms of a number of key issues in the policy environment;
&#132;X	The overarching neo-liberal policy context synonymous with a decline in public housing resources and increasing tension between NGOs service provider and advocacy roles.
&#132;X	The political nature of the local mental health policy context and lack of political commitment to ongoing resources. Broad community stigma reflected in the media and government, affecting ongoing political commitment to mental health and housing and the introduction and progress of housing &#161;&#165;projects&#161;&#166;.
&#132;X	The slow development of peak NGO and consumer organisations and alliances in South Australia which affected access to policy networks and contributed to the dominance of professional interests within policy processes. 
&#132;X	The separation of health, housing and disability policy and networks within and across levels of government. This was associated with bilateral agreements (between Australian and state governments) tied to resources within departments, the programme objectives and the goals of bureaucrats. 
&#132;X	The separation of policy networks by sector was also connected to the dominance of bio-medical discourses and interventions and associated professional interests in the health policy sector. Medical discourses on health and disability and &#161;&#165;consumerist&#161;&#166; discourses on participation also led to social determinants of health such as housing being overlooked within policy processes.
&#132;X	Governance reform at a state level contributed to organisational instability within departments, causing some problems for cross-sectoral initiatives and protocols.
Kingdon&#161;&#166;s (2003) multiple streams analysis of policy helped to explain what missed or reached political agendas within each policy sector of the case study. Kingdon predicts that the unity of policy networks is important for the realization of policy solutions, and the lack of unity in policy sectors was an obstacle to policy agendas on housing for people with a psychiatric disability. However, the way in which problems were being represented (Bacchi 1999) was also important to understanding this policy environment. For example, a medical discourse on disability (Fulcher 1989) tied to the health sector led to a narrow focus on clinical mental health services. Similarly, neo-liberal discourse (Dean 1999) supported private housing solutions and resources or NGOs advocating &#161;&#165;within sectors&#161;&#166; for the types of services they already provided or wished to provide.
The case study suggested strategies for &#161;&#165;policy change&#161;&#166; need to address a number of factors across service delivery, policy and political realms. Firstly, better recognition is warranted of the difficulty experienced by many people with psychiatric disability in achieving stable housing, and the need for indicators on housing access and stability for this group. Secondly, processes to address stigma (particularly that perpetuated in the media) will be instrumental for policy change and political commitment. Thirdly, ongoing cross sectoral advocacy and alliances require development at both a national and state level and support by a political culture which encourages advocacy. Developing processes for working across sectors such as policy learning forums involving both experts and community groups could counter problems arising from professional culture and territories that were documented in this study. Finally, the cross-sectoral development of policy, programmes and accountability mechanisms and the stability of policy networks will be important to ensuring stable housing for people with psychiatric disability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental health policy</field><field name="subject">psychiatric disability</field><field name="subject">mental illness</field><field name="subject">intersectoral policy</field><field name="subject">intersectoral collaboration</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">supported housing</field><field name="subject">housing policy</field><field name="subject">homelessness</field><field name="subject">community empowerment</field><field name="subject">community participation in health</field><field name="subject">deinstitutionalisation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080926.215213</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil mechanical properties and the behaviour of roots in structured soil : published works</field><field name="creator">Dexter, Anthony Roger.</field><field name="description">Comprised of the author's previously published works.

The distribution of soil organic C (SOC) largely follows gradients similar to biomass accumulation, increasing with increasing precipitation and decreasing temperature. As a result, SOC levels are a function of inputs, dominated by plant litter contributions and rhizodeposition, and losses such as leaching, erosion and heterotrophic respiration. Therefore, changes in biomass inputs, or organic matter accumulation, will most likely also alter these levels in soils. Although the soil microbial biomass (SMB) only comprises 1-5% of soil organic matter (SOM), it is critical in organic matter decomposition and can provide an early indicator of SOM dynamics as a whole due to its faster turnover time, and hence, can be used to determine soil C dynamics under changing environmental conditions.&#182;

Approximately 932 million ha of land worldwide are degraded due to salinity and sodicity, usually coinciding with land available for agriculture, with salinity affecting 23% of arable land while saline-sodic soils affect a further 10%. Soils affected by salinity, that is, those soils high in soluble salts, are characterised by rising watertables and waterlogging of lower-lying areas in the landscape. Sodic soils are high in exchangeable sodium, and slake and disperse upon wetting to form massive hardsetting structures. Upon drying, sodic soils suffer from poor soil-water relations largely related to decreased permeability, low infiltration capacity and the formation of surface crusts. In these degraded areas, SOC levels are likely to be affected by declining vegetation health and hence, decreasing biomass inputs and concomitant lower levels of organic matter accumulation. Moreover, potential SOC losses can also be affected from dispersed aggregates due to sodicity and solubilisation of SOM due to salinity. However, few studies are available that unambiguously demonstrate the effect of increasing salinity and sodicity on C dynamics. This thesis describes a range of laboratory and field investigations on the effects of salinity and sodicity on SOC dynamics.&#182;

In this research, the effects of a range of salinity and sodicity levels on C dynamics were determined by subjecting a vegetated soil from Bevendale, New South Wales (NSW) to one of six treatments. A low, mid or high salinity solution (EC 0.5, 10 or 30 dS/m) combined with a low or high sodicity solution (SAR 1 or 30) in a factorial design was leached through a non-degraded soil in a controlled environment. Soil respiration and the SMB were measured over a 12-week experimental period. The greatest increases in SMB occurred in treatments of high-salinity high-sodicity, and high-salinity low-sodicity. This was attributed to solubilisation of SOM which provided additional substrate for decomposition for the microbial population. Thus, 
as salinity and sodicity increase in the field, soil C is likely to be rapidly lost as a result of increased mineralisation.&#182;
 
Gypsum is the most commonly-used ameliorant in the rehabilitation of sodic and saline-sodic soils affected by adverse soil environmental conditions. When soils were sampled from two sodic profiles in salt-scalded areas at Bevendale and Young, SMB levels and soil respiration rates measured in the laboratory were found to be low in the sodic soil compared to normal non-degraded soils. When the sodic soils were treated with gypsum, there was no change in the SMB and respiration rates. The low levels of SMB and respiration rates were due to low SOC levels as a result of little or no C input into the soils of these highly degraded landscapes, as the high salinity and high sodicity levels have resulted in vegetation death. However, following the addition of organic material to the scalded soils, in the form of coarsely-ground kangaroo grass, SMB levels and respiration rates increased to levels greater than those found in the non-degraded soil. The addition of gypsum (with organic material) gave no additional increases in the SMB.&#182;

The level of SOC stocks in salt-scalded, vegetated and revegetated profiles was also determined, so that the amount of SOC lost due to salinisation and sodication, and the increase in SOC following revegetation relative to the amount of SOC in a vegetated profile could be ascertained. Results showed up to three times less SOC in salt-scalded profiles compared to vegetated profiles under native pasture, while revegetation of formerly scalded areas with introduced pasture displayed SOC levels comparable to those under native pasture to a depth of 30 cm. However, SOC stocks can be underestimated in saline and sodic landscapes by setting the lower boundary at 30 cm due to the presence of waterlogging, which commonly occurs at a depth greater than 30 cm in saline and sodic landscapes as a result of the presence of high or perched watertables. These results indicate that successful revegetation of scalded areas has the potential to accumulate SOC stocks similar to those found prior to degradation.&#182; 

The experimental results from this project indicate that in salt-affected landscapes, initial increases in salinity and sodicity result in rapid C mineralisation. Biomass inputs also decrease due to declining vegetation health, followed by further losses as a result of leaching and erosion. The remaining native SOM is then mineralised, until very low SOC stocks remain. However, the C sequestration potential in these degraded areas is high, particularly if rehabilitation efforts are successful in reducing salinity and sodicity. Soil ecosystem functions can then be restored if organic material is available as C stock and for decomposition in the form of either added organic material or inputs from vegetation when these salt-affected landscapes are revegetated.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">sodicity</field><field name="subject">soil carbon</field><field name="subject">soil microbial biomass</field><field name="subject">soil respiration</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080428.223144</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fiddler crab claw-waving display: an analysis of the structure and function of a movement-based visual signal</field><field name="creator">How, Martin John</field><field name="description">Communication is an essential component of animal social systems and a diverse suite of signals can be found in the natural environment. An area of animal communication that, for technical reasons, we know very little about is the field of &#145;movement-based&#146; or &#145;dynamic&#146; visual signals. In this thesis, I make use of recent advances in measurement and analysis techniques, including digital video and image motion processing tools, to improve our understanding of how movement-based signals are adjusted according to signalling context. I measured and characterised the flamboyant claw-waving displays of male fiddler crabs (Genus Uca) and made use of their transparent lifestyle to record the behavioural contexts in which these signals are produced.&#182;  
The claw-waving displays of seven Australian species of fiddler crab are compared and contrasted to show that these signals are species-specific, but also vary within and between individuals. I show that the species Uca perplexa produces different types of signal in different behavioural contexts, a lateral wave for courtship, and a vertical wave during short-range agonistic and courtship interactions. The structure of the lateral courtship waves of Uca perplexa vary according to the distance of signal receivers, the first time this kind of relationship has been shown in a dynamic visual signal. Finally, I describe and analyse the signalling and orientation behaviour of U. elegans during courtship herding, an unusual mating system that uses the claw-waving display in a novel way.&#182;
The adjustments made by fiddler crabs to their displays during changes in behavioural contexts suggest that the fine-scale context-sensitivity of animal signals may be far more widespread in communication than hitherto recognised.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fiddler crab</field><field name="subject">visual ecology</field><field name="subject">dynamic visual signal</field><field name="subject">movement-based signal</field><field name="subject">animal communication</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20081001.111333</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions to the molecular genetics of the Narrow-leaf Lupin (Lupinus augustifolius L.) : mapping, marker development and QTL analysis</field><field name="creator">Boersma, Jeffrey George</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Narrow-leaf lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) was first recorded as having been introduced into Germany during the mid-19th century for use as green manuring and as fodder crops. However, it was not until post World-War I that there was any serious attempt to domesticate the species. Since that time several key domestication genes have been incorporated to enable the species to be grown as a crop over a range of climates, harvested as a bulk commodity and, the seed used for both animal and human consumption. However, the recent domestication of this species has seen a rather limited use of wild germplasm  largely as a result of the difficulty in retaining these key domestication genes. To make the task of retaining these genes manageable, it was decided to resort to molecular technology. A mapping population of F8 derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs) has previously been established by the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia, from a cross between a domesticated breeding line 83A:476 and a wild type P27255 in narrow-leaf lupin. The parents together with 89 RILs (of a population of 115) were subjected to DNA fingerprinting using microsatelliteanchored fragment length polymorphism (MFLP) to rapidly generate DNA markers for construction of a linkage map. Five hundred and twenty two unique markers of which 21% were co-dominant, were generated and mapped. Phenotypic data for the domestication traits: mollis (soft seeds), leucospermus (white flower and seed colour); Lentus (reduced pod-shattering), iucundis (low alkaloid), Ku (early flowering) and moustache pattern on seed coats; were included. Three to 7 molecular markers were identified within 5 cM of each of these domestication genes. The anthracnose resistance gene Lanr1 was also mapped. Linkage groups were constructed using MapManager version QTXb20, resulting in 21 linkage groups consisting of 8 or more markers. ... Five pairs of QTLs were found to be involved in epistasis, 2 of these having an effect on early vigour and another 3 influencing the time to opening of the first florets. Variation explained for each trait ranged from 28% for seed size, to 88% for days to flowering. We showed that it was possible to use this data to predict genotypes of superior progeny for these traits under Mediterranean conditions. QTL regions were compared on a second published linkage map and regions of conserved synteny with the model legume Medicago truncatula high-lighted. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates the importance of tight linkage between markers and genes of interest. It is especially important when dealing with genetically diverse material as found in the wild. One of the main problems faced by molecular scientists is the phenomenon known as linkage disequilibrium in marker populations caused by either small population size or 4 insufficient opportunity for recombination. This frequently results in the development of markers with little or no application outside of the population in which it was developed. Although the relatively small size of the population used in this study exposes it to such constraints, in this case excellent and valuable results were achieved in developing useful markers to at least 3 of the domestication traits within a relatively short time period of less then 4 years.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lupinus angustifolius -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Lupines -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Gene mapping</field><field name="subject">Genetic markers</field><field name="subject">Narrow-leaf lupins</field><field name="subject">Genetic mapping</field><field name="subject">Molecular markers</field><field name="subject">Quantitative traits</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0001</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the effects of risk and uncertainty on consumers' decision-making processes : a cross-national study</field><field name="creator">Quintal, Vanessa Ann</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Global tourism accounted for US$623 billion in 2004, representing 6% of the world's exports of goods and services (World Tourism Organisation, 2005). In the last decade, natural and man-made disasters have adversely affected the tourism industry. Consequently, the risk and uncertainty associated with travel have increased, potentially impacting on tourists' behaviour. However, while travel motivators have received a great deal of research attention, travel constraints have not been examined to the same degree. The present study explores risk and uncertainty and their roles in people's decisionmaking processes in a tourism context. In doing so, attempts were made to clarify the distinction between the risk and uncertainty constructs, which in prior research often have been used interchangeably, leading to some confusion about their roles. The distinction between the perceptual and attitudinal constructs also was clarified, as prior research into their differential impacts has been limited. To achieve these objectives, data were collected from online research panel members in Australia, the United States (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), New Zealand, South Korea, China and Japan, as part of a larger tourism study.

It analyses data collected from managers and facilitators to identify the critical contingency factors that influence the use of group facilitation. The data was analysed using an iterative process of grounded content analysis. The findings identify four primary contingency factors that influence the use of group facilitation. Chief among these is the 'outcomes-oriented' worldview that characterises the theories-in-use of both managers and facilitators. Group facilitation is used when managers perceive that it is likely to be an appropriate intervention which will enable the achievement of certain desired organisational goals. A parallel finding is that the relationship between managers and external facilitators is frequently 'instrumental' in nature. These findings have significant implications for both the theory and practice of group facilitation, especially concerning the field's dominant view of facilitation as a 'neutral' intervention. It extends the perspective proffered by a minority of scholars and writers in this field. The other primary contingency factors identified in this study include the complexity of the group's task; the need to challenge or otherwise alter the way a group is thinking in relation to its task; and the need to have open discussions about issues pertaining to the work or life of the group when the expertise to enable such discussions is not otherwise available. In addition to the implications regarding the neutrality of facilitation, the findings of this study have implications for the management of groups within organisations. Facilitation is demonstrably a useful means of building trust and enhancing relationships in numerous situations. It is also clearly perceived to be an appropriate means of enabling groups to structure and manage complex tasks. This includes tasks that are both objectively complex in nature, and those that group members subjectively experience as complex tasks. Given the increasing complexity of business environments, the complexity of many group tasks, and the increasing propensity for organisations to utilise teams and groups to get work done, facilitation is emerging as an important means of assisting organisational effectiveness.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Group facilitation</field><field name="subject">Teams in the workplace</field><field name="subject">Interactive management</field><field name="subject">Group problem solving</field><field name="subject">Group Decision Making</field><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Organisations</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0069</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour and analysis of embedded cantilever wall on a slope</field><field name="creator">Ong, Chin Chai</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The feasibility of using interlocked light gauge sheet piles to form a deep cross-sectional wall embedded in a residual slope or with a berm support is explored. This thesis compares the performance of a large section modulus sheet pile wall as an alternative to a concrete diaphragm wall, acting as an embedded cantilever wall on a slope (ECWS) by means of experimental centrifuge tests, numerical models and analytical methods. Abaqus (Hibbitt, Karlsson and Sorensen Inc, 1997) was used to conduct extensive numerical trials on the structural performance of the sheet pile wall model prior to the actual physical testing. The Abaqus results showed that the integrity of the interlock and reduced modulus action (RMA) due to slippage along the interlocked joint did not cause premature buckling of the thin wall even at the ultimate load. Further, a comparative study using centrifuge tests on 1:30 scaled models and Plaxis analysis demonstrated that under the worst condition with high water table, the rigid sheet pile wall of 1.32 m cross-sectional width carried a higher ultimate surcharge load with a much lower top of wall deflection, compared to a more flexible 0.6 m thick cracked concrete diaphragm wall. The analysis of the wall/soil/slope interactions for an ECWS involves many inter-dependent variables in addition to the complications of considering an adjacent slope or a berm support. It is difficult for existing analytical approaches to take all these factors into account, and some form of numerical analysis, calibrated through field data and results from centrifuge model tests is necessary. From the observations of the centrifuge tests and finite element analysis, major assumptions about the failure of a stiff ECWS in a rotational mode were deduced and adopted in the proposed limiting equilibrium method (Leq). The plane strain Leq ECWS Abstract ii analysis is based on the framework of minimum upper bound limiting equilibrium with planar failure planes and a Mohr-Coulomb soil model. As compared to the traditional limit equilibrium analysis, the Leq method is a fully coupled analysis using the shear strength reduction technique (SSR). New formulations are proposed for the development of horizontal active and passive pressure distributions based on the experimental and FE models. The proposed active pressure profile used is derived by combining the Coulomb and Krey method, and empirically back-figured to curve-fit the centrifuge tests by Morris (2005). The proposed passive pressure profile of a rigid rotational wall in failure is adjusted to allow for an adjacent slope or berm support through a presumed elasto-plastic deformation instead of a linear rigid translation of the passive wedge. ... A parametric study was later undertaken using the Leq method to develop a series of non-dimensionalised graphs to study and draw summarised conclusions on the behaviour of the ECWS. The final conclusions on the comparative study of the centrifuge tests, Plaxis and Leq analyses demonstrated that the alternative light gauge steel sheet pile performed very well as an ECWS. A key factor in the performance of the sheet pile wall was attributed to the large 1.32 m cross-sectional width of the interlocked sections. This provided high bending stiffness and high moment stability from shear stresses acting on the back and front faces of the wall.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retaining walls</field><field name="subject">Slopes (Soil mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Centrifugation</field><field name="subject">Embedded cantilever wall</field><field name="subject">Limit equilibrium</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0076</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and RNA-binding of poly (C) protein 1</field><field name="creator">Sidiqi, Mahjooba</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Regulation of mRNA stability is an important posttranscriptional mechanism involved in the control of gene expression. The rate of mRNA decay can differ greatly from one mRNA to another and may be regulated by RNA-protein interactions. A key determinant of mRNA decay are sequence instability (cis) elements often located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of many mRNAs. For example, the AU rich elements (AREs), are such well characterized elements, and most commonly involved in promoting mRNA degradation, and specific binding of proteins to these elements leading to the stabilization of some mRNAs. Other cis-elements have been described for mRNA in which mRNA stability is a critical component of gene regulation. This includes the androgen receptor (AR) UC-rich cis element in its 3'UTR. The AR is a key target for therapeutics in human prostate cancer and thus understanding the mechanism involved in regulating its expression is an important goal. The [alpha]CP1 protein, a KH-domain containing RNA-binding protein has been found to bind this UC-rich region of the AR and is thought to play an important role in regulating AR mRNA expression. [alpha]CP1 protein is a triple KH (hnRNP K homology) domain protein with specificity for Crich tracts of RNA and ssDNA (single stranded DNA). Relatively little is known about the structural interaction of [alpha]CP1 with target RNA cis elements, thus the present study aimed to better understand the nature of interaction between 30 nt 3'UTR UC-rich AR mRNA and [alpha]CP1 protein using various biophysical techniques, in an attempt to determine which [alpha]CP1 domain or combination of domains is involved in RNA-binding. These studies could ultimately provide novel targets for drugs aimed to regulate AR mRNA expression in prostate cancer cells. At the commencement of this study little was known about the structure of the [alpha]CP1- KH domains and their basis for poly (C) binding specificity. ... Additional studies addressed the significance of the four core recognition nucleotides (TCCC) using a series of cytosine to thymine mutants. The findings verified some of the results predicted from structural studies, especially the need for maximum KH binding to a core tetranucleotide recognition sequence. Our mutational studies of the four core bases confirmed the importance of cytosine in positions two and three as no binding was observed, while some binding was observed when the fourth base was mutated. In summary, the work presented in this thesis provides new detailed insight into the molecular interactions between the [alpha]CP1-KH domain and AR mRNA. Furthermore, these studies shed light on the nature of protein/mRNA interactions in general, as well as the specific complex that forms on AR mRNA. These studies have provided new understanding into the mode of [alpha]CP1 binding at a target oligonucleotide binding site and, provide a foundation for future studies to define structure of multiprotein/oligonucleotide complexes involved in AR mRNA gene regulation. Understanding the detailed interaction between the AR mRNA and [alpha]CP1 could provide possible targets for drug development at reducing AR expression in prostate cancer cells by interfering with the interaction of [alpha]CP1 and AR-mRNA.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RNA-protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Protein binding -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">xCPI-KHI</field><field name="subject">RNA-binding protein</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0077</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical model of the reproductive endocrine system in male sheep</field><field name="creator">Ferasyi, Teuku Reza</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The activity of the reproductive endocrine axis is the result of interactions among many organs and tissues, particularly the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and gonad. However, it depends on more than the communication between anatomical structures because it is also affected by genotype, internal factors (e.g., metabolic inputs) and external factors (e.g., photoperiod, socio-sexual cues, stress, nutrition). This multifactorial complexity makes it difficult to use animal experimentation to investigate the pathways and mechanisms involved. Therefore, in this study, I have turned to mathematical modelling. The general hypothesis was that, by modelling the hormonal feedback loop that links the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and gonad, I would be able to discover the critical control points in this homeostatic system. This would allow me to inform and direct research into the processes that control reproduction, including inputs from environmental factors. My studies began with the development of a model of the negative feedback loop through which testosterone controls the secretion of pulses of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the hypothalamus. The model incorporated two critical factors: testosterone concentration and a time delay in the inhibition of the activity of the GnRH 'pulse generator' by testosterone. The general assumptions were: i) there are two positive feedforward processes (GnRH pulses stimulate LH pulses, and, in turn, LH pulses stimulate testosterone secretion); ii) testosterone exerts negative feedback that reduces the frequency of GnRH pulses. The model incorporated a group of equations that represent the GnRH pulse generator, through which the inhibitory effect of testosterone acted to reduce GnRH pulse frequency. Simulations were run with various values for the time delay in feedback and, as model development progressed, the simulations were extended to include combinations of time delays and levels of sensitivity of the GnRH pulse generator to inhibition by testosterone. The output of the simulations showed clearly that a time delay in negative feedback, as well as the concentration of testosterone, can greatly affect the frequency of GnRH pulses and the shape of the GnRH secretory profile. Importantly, the effect of the time delay depends on the sensitivity of the pulse generator to testosterone. In addition, the simulations suggested two additional components that might be involved in the control of the GnRH pulse generator: i) a delay in the rate of adaptation to a change in steroid feedback; and ii) a minimum pulse interval (maximum frequency). These studies iii therefore suggest that the regulation of the activity of the GnRH pulse generator, and thus the frequency and profile of GnRH and LH pulses, requires interactions among these four components. These interactions should be tested in animal experimentation. In the next stage, I extended the model so I could test whether the feedback delay might involve the process of aromatization in which testosterone is converted to oestradiol at brain level. ... This information can be used to direct future experimental studies that will help us to understand the factors that underlie the dynamic behaviour of the hypothalamic and pituitary systems that control reproduction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Livestock -- Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Sheep -- Reproduction -- Endocrine aspects</field><field name="subject">Veterinary endocrinology</field><field name="subject">Mathematical model</field><field name="subject">Reproductive endocrine system</field><field name="subject">Male sheep</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0080</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of immune regulation in HIV disease</field><field name="creator">Lim, Andrew Yih-Fan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] HIV infection compromises the ability of the host to mount effective immune responses. In untreated HIV disease, immune activation drives high rates of cell turnover and apoptosis, ultimately leading to abnormal and dysregulated cellular function. Immune activation may also induce the expansion of CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cell populations capable of suppressing anti-HIV responses. Treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) allows the recovery of CD4+ T cell numbers in most patients. Persistent deficiencies in the number and function of CD4+ T cells seen in a proportion of individuals may reflect elevated numbers of Treg cells or an imbalanced regulatory-to-effector cytokine milieu. Furthermore, some patients develop paradoxical illnesses associated with the recovery of cellular function, known as immune restoration disease (IRD). The first part of this thesis addresses the role of CD4+ Treg cells in untreated and treated HIV disease. The second part addresses the phenotype of immune cells that express IL-10 and its receptor in untreated and treated patients, and the role of IL-10 in mycobacterial IRD. Firstly, several cell surface markers were evaluated to find a flow cytometry assay that could be used routinely to identify CD4+ Treg cells in HIV-infected patients. I tested CD25, GITR, CTLA-4, NRP-1 and LAG-3, but their expression did not mirror the expression of FoxP3, an intracellular transcription factor specific to CD4+ Treg cells (Chapter 2). Two published studies then described the use of CD127 to identify CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells in humans. Using CD127, I determined the proportions and numbers of CD4+ Treg cells in untreated HIV-infected patients and in patients in their first year of ART. Proportions of CD4+ Treg cells correlated with the proportions of activated (HLA-DRHI) CD4+ T cells and with plasma HIV RNA levels in untreated patients, but showed an inverse correlation with CD4+ T cell count. In both untreated and treated patients, the proportions and numbers of FoxP3+ cells that expressed CD8 were significantly higher than in uninfected donors. This was clearest in patients with CD4+ T cell counts below 300/'L (Chapter 3). This body of work suggests that the frequencies of CD4+ Treg cells are directly related to the level of HIV-associated immune activation. Phenotyping of FoxP3+CD4+ Treg cells in untreated and treated patients and in uninfected donors revealed that co-expression of CD45RO, CD28, CTLA-4 and markers of activation were similar in all HIV-infected patients and controls. ii FoxP3+CD8+ T cells exhibit lower levels of CD45RO, CD28 and CTLA-4, but higher expression of PD-1 and CD57 (Chapter 4). This suggests that FoxP3+CD8+ T cells may have a reduced functional capacity. It is unclear whether they have regulatory activity by virtue of FoxP3 expression. ... Both patients produced higher levels of IFN? compared with IL-10 in response to mycobacterial antigens. In contrast, patients who experienced uneventful immune reconstitution produced higher levels of IL-10 (Chapter 6). Part 1 of this thesis highlights the importance of using specific cellular markers to identify CD4+ Treg cells, and confirms CD127 as a valuable marker for routine monitoring of blood Treg cells. Part 2 of this thesis demonstrates the important regulatory role of IL-10 in patients receiving ART.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">T cells -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease)</field><field name="subject">Cellular immunity</field><field name="subject">HIV infections</field><field name="subject">Immune response -- Regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0081</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of new heterogeneous Fischer-Tropsch catalysts : the incorporation of metal aggregates in mesoporous silicas</field><field name="creator">Hondow, Nicole S.</field><field name="description">Transition metals have been extensively studied as catalysts, and certain metals are known to be highly selective and active for certain processes. It is possible to use metal clusters as models for reactions occurring at metal surfaces, but it is often found that in practical applications these complexes are unstable and break down. It is possible to support or stabilise a metal species on, or in, an inorganic framework, making heterogeneous catalysts. A study of metal cluster chemistry with mixed-donor phosphine ligands was conducted, with several new ruthenium complexes synthesised. The chemistry of metal-sulfur interactions is applicable to the removal of sulfur from crude oil, and in an investigation to this chemistry, the bifunctional ligand HSCH2CH2PPhH was added to ruthenium clusters (Chapter 2). The addition of this sulfur-phosphine ligand to the cluster [Ru3([mu]-dppm)(CO)10] produced the carbonyl substituted cluster [Ru3([mu]-dppm)(H)(CO)7(SCH2CH2PPhH)] and the bridged complex [Ru3([mu]-dppm)(H)(CO)8(SCH2CH2PPhH)Ru3([mu]-dppm)(CO)9], as well as recovery of the starting material. Further reactions with this ligand were examined with [Ru3(CO)12] and other complexes were synthesised with different clusters and ligands (Chapter 2). The M41S materials, MCM-41 and MCM-48, are well ordered porous materials with high surface areas (Chapter 3). The incorporation of three different types of metal species, metallosurfactants, metal clusters and nanoparticles, into these materials was examined in an attempt to make heterogeneous catalysts for the Fischer-Tropsch process. The success of this was studied using characterisation techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and BET surface area measurements. Metallosurfactants containing either copper or cobalt were added directly to the synthesis of the porous materials in an attempt to incorporate the metals into the framework structure of the porous silica (Chapter 3). This resulted in well ordered iv porous materials, but the successful incorporation of the metal species was found to be dependent on several factors. Organometallic clusters containing metals such as copper, iron and ruthenium, with supporting carbonyl ligands, were added post-synthesis to MCM-41 and MCM-48 (Chapter 4). Various reaction conditions were examined in attempts to ensure small particle formation. The optimum incorporation of nanoparticles containing iron and platinum was found to occur when a suspension of pre-made and purified nanoparticles was added post-synthesis to the M41S materials (Chapter 4). These materials resulted in porous silicas with well dispersed, small metal particles. The optimum conditions for the calcination of these new materials were determined, in an attempt to remove the ligands and stabilisers and retain the small metal particle size (Chapter 5). Testing for the Fischer-Tropsch process was conducted in a fixed bed reactor through which a flow of synthesis gas containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen could pass over the material (Chapter 5). Analysis by gas chromatography showed that the major product produced by all materials tested was methane, but other hydrocarbons were produced in small amounts, including hexane.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fischer-Tropsch process</field><field name="subject">Catalysts</field><field name="subject">Heterogeneous catalysis</field><field name="subject">Porous materials</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0083</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can the performance of activities of daily living questionnaire identify children with developmental coordination disorder?</field><field name="creator">Hill, Catherine Lindsay</field><field name="description">Currently a lack of guidelines for Criterion B of the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) hampers diagnosis of children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). The Performance of Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (PADL-Q; Dewey, Larkin &amp; Summers, 2004) is a new parent-reported instrument developed to quantify the level of interference in activities of daily living (ADL) experienced by children with DCD and was tested for its efficacy in addressing Criterion B. Thirty-two children aged between 5 and 10 years comprising two matched groups, 16 with DCD (8 boys and 8 girls) and 16 without DCD (8 boys and 8 girls) participated in the study. The aim of the research was to investigate the ability of the PADL-Q to identify differences between children with and without DCD. A further 5 children, in the same age range, who did not have DCD added data that was used to ascertain relationships between the constituent assessments. All children were tested using the MAND (McCarron, 1982) whilst their parents completed the PADL-Q. A set of Tests of Activities of Daily Living (TADL) tasks were devised for the children to perform that further validated parents ratings of children?s ADL performance. A Group x Gender MANCOVA, controlled for age, of the PADL-Q total scores demonstrated that there was a significant difference between the children with and without DCD (F(3,25) = 9.44, p &lt; .001; Wilks' lambda = 0.47). Follow-up univariate tests showed a Group x Gender interaction and simple main effects of this interaction indicated that the PADL-Q did not discriminate between the DCD and non-DCD boys. The ability of the PADL-Q to identify DCD was explored in the concurrent validity against the MAND when using a diagnostic cut-off point. The PADL-Q demonstrated 100% specificity and positive predictive values but only 19% sensitivity and 62% negative predictive values. There was a moderately strong relationship (r = .71), between the PADL-Q total score, considered a measure of Criterion B, and the MAND, a measure of Criterion A (DSMIV- TR, 2000). A two factor (Group x Gender) ANCOVA, controlled for age, of the TADL items revealed a statistically significant effect for DCD only (F(1,19) = 34.65, p &lt; .001). There was a moderate correlation (r = -.64) between the PADL-Q total score and the TADL tasks, indicating that parent-reports are supported by their child?s performance. The PADL-Q appears to have potential as part of the DCD diagnostic process; however, further refinement on a larger sample is necessary before it can be used as an easily-administered guide to ADL performance levels in children.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motor ability in children</field><field name="subject">Developmental disabilities</field><field name="subject">Movement disorders in children</field><field name="subject">Educational surveys</field><field name="subject">Motor control</field><field name="subject">Activities of daily living</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Questionnaire</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0096</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and use of a Monte Carlo-Markov cycle tree model for coronary heart disease incidence-mortality and health service usage with explicit recognition of coronary artery revascularization procedures (CARPs)</field><field name="creator">Mannan, Haider Rashid</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The main objective of this study was to develop and validate a demographic/epidemiologic Markov model for population modelling/forecasting of CARPs as well as CHD deaths and incidence in Western Australia using population, linked hospital morbidity and mortality data for WA over the period 1980 to 2000. A key feature of the model was the ability to count events as individuals moved from one state to another and an important aspect of model development and implementation was the method for estimation of model transition probabilities from available population data. The model was validated through comparison of model predictions with actual event numbers and through demonstration of its use in producing forecasts under standard extrapolation methods for transition probabilities as well as improving the forecasts by taking into account various possible changes to the management of CHD via surgical treatment changes. The final major objective was to demonstrate the use of model for performing sensitivity analysis of some scenarios. In particular, to explore the possible impact on future numbers of CARPs due to improvements in surgical procedures, particularly the introduction of drug eluting stents, and to explore the possible impact of change in trend of CHD incidence as might be caused by the obesity epidemic. ... When the effectiveness of PCI due to introduction of DES was increased by reducing Pr(CABG given PCI) and Pr(a repeat PCI), there was a small decline in the requirements for PCIs and the effect seemed to have a lag. Finally, in addition to these changes when other changes were incorporated which captured that a PCI was used more than a CABG due to a change in health policy after the introduction of DES, there was a small increase in the requirements for PCIs with a lag in the effect. Four incidence scenarios were developed for assessing the effect of change in secular trends of CHD incidence as might be caused by the obesity epidemic in such a way that they gradually represented an increasing effect of obesity epidemic (assuming that other risk factors changed favourably) on CHD incidence. The strategy adopted for developing the scenarios was that based on past trends the most dominant component of CHD incidence was first gradually altered and finally the remaining components were altered. iv The results showed that if the most dominant component of CHD incidence, eg, Pr(CHD - no history of CHD) levelled off and the trends in all other transition probabilities continued into future, then the projected numbers of CABGs and PCIs for 2001-2005 were insensitive to these changes. Even increasing this probability by as much as 20 percent did not alter the results much. These results implied that the short-term effect on projected numbers of CARPs caused by an increase in the most dominant component of CHD incidence, possibly due to an ?obesity epidemic, is small. In the final incidence scenario, two of the remaining CHD incidence components-Pr(CABG - no history of CHD) and Pr(CHD death - no CHD and no history of CHD) were projected to level off over 2001-2005 because these probabilities were declining over the baseline period of 1998-2000. The projected numbers of CABGs were more sensitive (compared to the previous scenarios) to these changes but PCIs were not.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease -- Western Australia -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease -- Mortality -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Myocardial revascularization</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo method</field><field name="subject">Markov processes</field><field name="subject">Medicine -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0101</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ballad of the never picked : a qualitative study of self-perceived non-musicians' perceptions of their musicality</field><field name="creator">Ruddock, Eve</field><field name="description">Humans are a musical species and every culture has its music. However, twenty individuals out of a cohort of twenty-nine participants in this study judged themselves to be 'not musical'. Through their words, silences and responses, the story of music in the lives of these self-perceived non-musicians uncovered a musical world where concepts of performance, judgment and talent dominate. My investigation into individuals' perceptions of their musicality revealed a pervasive societal belief that individuals were either born 'musical' or they were not; their everyday reality was one where music was perceived as a performance, an object, something that only talented people can 'do'. I planned conversations with participants that aimed to reveal clues that could help to unravel a paradox that lies within music in our Western culture: every young human is intrinsically musical but only some are born with a gift to be musical. Participant convictions that they were not musical deterred some individuals from active engagement in music making. They felt as if they had been left out of the 'musical ballpark'. Details from conversations illustrated a constricting cultural imposition on individuals; this was perpetuated in many schools and also in private music teaching. Data revealed that current educational practice contributed to a denial of a natural birthright and alienated some individuals from being part of a musical community. As their stories revealed failed attempts to engage in music making, iterative contacts created a daunting quantity of data. But there was poetry in participant data. These self-perceived non-musicians simultaneously demonstrated their musicality in the rhythms of their narrative as they denied that they were musical; this emerged as a means to report the research whereby participants' words combined to tell a non-musician's tale. Compelling narrative revealed a society where educational practice does little to address individual musical development. While each story alone was specific and complex, once the stories became woven together as a complex and contradictory whole, the ballad of the never picked captured the essence of a distanced musicality in our Western society. Narrative drove towards meaning. Through interpretation and detailed qualitative analysis, understandings began to emerge from depths of experience and from friction existing within contradictions. Deep within narrative which evolved over a period of five years were perceptions that led to understandings of our cultural reality. Active involvement in this research became part of an emancipatory process for several participants where mutually reflective acts exposed unnecessary impositions from societal expectations. Participant voices uncover a bifurcated reality wherein the musical development of many individuals is undermined through an ignorance of holistic human potential; this musical-unmusical divide is perpetuated in educational practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Musical ability</field><field name="subject">Personality and creative ability</field><field name="subject">Self-perception</field><field name="subject">Perceived musicality</field><field name="subject">Musical/non-musical</field><field name="subject">Music education</field><field name="subject">Self-perception</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0103</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of children in a monopoly print medium</field><field name="creator">White, Philippa Anne Reynolds</field><field name="description">This research explores the representation of children and young people in a newspaper. The objective was to develop a 'case study' profile of representations in a monopoly daily newspaper in a geographically-isolated Australian capital city. News content with a primary focus on people aged zero to eighteen years was collected for a 12-month period, and analysed from a constructionist perspective, using agenda-setting, news source, media framing and critical linguistics media analysis techniques. Distinctive features of the research design include the combination of these four analytic techniques and the breadth of the age cohort in the research sample. A large body of research literature is used to 'benchmark' the primary analysis of data, and to inform the analyses of age, 'race' and gender. These data are consolidated in three thematic frames: the Promotional Child, Victim Child and Deviant Child, which underpin the aggregated profile of representations developed in this research. Numerous images are reproduced from the research sample and appear throughout the thesis, embedded in relevant discussions. The concluding chapter of the thesis foregrounds a perception of children as voiceless, vulnerable and violent characters, featured in a discourse on social control. Key observations highlighted in this research include disparities in the degree of overt vernacular criticism applied to children and other minority population groups; and the over-representation of marginalised cohorts in compromising newspaper images. The extensive use of children in promotional contexts appears to be partially obscured by the altruistic function of non-commercial promotions and advocacy campaigns. 'Collisions' between altruistic values and news values were found to be predictive of outcomes coinciding with the interests of a target audience; negative outcomes for socially disadvantaged children; and consistent 'collateral benefits' for the news medium  seemingly regardless of outcomes experienced by other stakeholders.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">West Australian Newspapers</field><field name="subject">Mass media and children</field><field name="subject">Mass media and teenagers</field><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Newspapers -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Newspapers and children</field><field name="subject">Youth reporting</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Media representations of children</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0104</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In two minds (novel) ; and A singular voice (dissertation)</field><field name="creator">Albertson, Jennifer</field><field name="description">&lt;abstract&gt;'In Two Minds' is a novel of false beliefs. Set in contemporary Sydney, it deals with the relationship between two sisters in their late thirties, Kara and Linda Hille. Told in the second person singular from the point of view of the elder sister, Linda, it is based around the neurological delusion of the younger sibling, Kara. Kara wrongly believes that their mother, Stella, has been replaced by an impostor, 'Mrs. Whitegloves'. For the greater part, the narrative 'you' relates events in the sisters' lives and deals with issues such as the consequences of condoned child abuse, the dilemma of human cloning and the future of 'the brand' in the light of contemporary global marketing. Linda, an advertising executive, struggles with a formidable work-project, an account that is lost to a competitor, and the mistaken belief that she is responsible for her sister's plight. Shocking graffiti about herself, which appears at the same time as she wins an advertising award, proves to be the catalyst that brings beneficial change to her life. Through the tragedy of confronting her sister's devastation and her own challenges, Linda leaves her job, believing this will allow her to start again - differently. In the final chapter, the difference is registered in a shift from the second person to the consolidated first person method of narration. ABSTRACT  EXEGESIS The dissertation 'A Singular Voice' documents aspects of authorial, psychoanalytical and literary significance in the creation of a fiction which draws on personal material confrontational to the writer. It also discusses some wider (non-fictional and other) uses of the narrative 'you' in order to establish the literary tradition in which the novel 'In Two Minds' may be situated. This disseration examines the use of the second-person singular pronoun 'you' as narrator, mainly in contemporary fiction. It concentrates on the ways in which the narrative 'you' was employed to achieve a 'cover', mask or persona for the 'I' behind the text in the novel 'In Two Minds', and explains why it was necessary to seek such subterfuge. It describes how certain grammatical and rhetorical resources were used to build and maintain 'cover', while at the same time allowing the narrative 'you' to express a particular aspect of the fictional protagonist, address the reader, and sustain the story of which it is the intradiegetic narratee. Related narrative elements include construction of the characters through the use of the narrative 'you', for example the narcissistic mother, Stella; the phantom double, 'Mrs. Whitegloves'; the sufferer of Capgras' delusion, Kara; and the ultimate bearer of the singular 'you' voice, the protagonist Linda.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narration (Rhetoric) -- Psychological Aspects</field><field name="subject">Novel -- English -- Australia -- 21st century\vtexts</field><field name="subject">Persona (Literature)</field><field name="subject">Mothers and daughters in literature</field><field name="subject">Sisters in literature</field><field name="subject">Child abuse in literature</field><field name="subject">Delusions in literature</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapy and literature</field><field name="subject">Second person singular</field><field name="subject">Double deixis</field><field name="subject">Caparas' delusion</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0105</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of the mechanisms of wild radish herbicide resistance to PSII inhibitors, auxinics, and AHAS inhibitors</field><field name="creator">Friesen, Lincoln Jacob Shane</field><field name="description">The objective of this Ph.D. research was to identify new and novel mechanisms of wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.) resistance to photosystem II (PSII) inhibitors, auxinics, and acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) inhibitors. PSIIinhibitor resistance was demonstrated to be target-site based, and conferred by a Ser264 to Gly substitution of the D1 protein. Auxinic resistance was associated with reduced herbicide translocation to the meristematic regions of resistant wild radish plants. Two new resistance mutations of wild radish AHAS were discovered, including one encoding the globally rare Asp376 to Glu substitution, and another encoding an Ala122 to Tyr substitution, which has never been identified or assessed for resistance in plants previously. Characterization of the frequency and distribution of AHAS resistance mutations in wild radish from the WA wheatbelt revealed that Glu376 was widespread, and that some mutations of AHAS are more common than others. Computer simulation was used to examine the molecular basis of resistance-endowing AHAS target-site mutations. Furthermore, through the computer-aided analysis, residues were identified with the potential to confer resistance upon substitution, but which have not previously been assessed for this possibility. Results from this Ph.D. research demonstrate that diverse, unrelated mechanisms of resistance to PSII inhibitors, auxinics, and AHAS inhibitors have evolved in wild radish of the WA wheatbelt, and that these mechanisms have accumulated in some populations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radishes -- Control -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Herbicide resistance</field><field name="subject">Plants --  Effect of herbicides on</field><field name="subject">AHAS/ALS inhibitor resistance</field><field name="subject">Auxinic herbicide resistance</field><field name="subject">PSII inhibitor resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0106</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental changes to ecosystem properties and processes linked to plant invasion and fire frequency in a biodiverse woodland</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Judith L.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Mediterranean southwest Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot, has nutrient deficient soils, exacting climatic conditions and is species rich with 7380 native vascular plant species, of which 49% are endemic. The region is expected to experience one of the world's highest degrees of biodiversity loss and change in the coming decades, with introduced species presenting a major threat. Limited knowledge is available on the mechanisms of ecosystem change associated with invasion and fire in this biodiversity hotspot region. Banksia woodland, an iconic complex species-rich natural ecosystem is one of the major vegetation types of the coastal sandplain, extending from 15 to 90 km inland and 400 kms along the west coast. The following hypothesis was tested to explore the ecological impacts of invasion: Is invasion of Banksia woodland by the introduced species Ehrharta calycina and Pelargonium capitatum accompanied by an alteration in ecosystem properties and processes, whereby the degree of change is related to fire frequency and abundance of introduced species? Different vegetation conditions, i.e. Good Condition (GC), Medium Condition (MC), Poor Condition invaded by Ehrharta calycina (PCe) and Poor Condition invaded by Pelargonium capitatum (PCp) were utilized for field assessments. ... In the soil seed bank, species numbers and germinant density decreased significantly for native and seeder (fire sensitive) species between GC sites and invaded sites. Surprisingly 52% of germinants at GC sites were from introduced species, with much of the introduced soil seed bank being persistent. Native species were dominated by perennial shrubs, herbs and sedges, while introduced species were dominated by perennial and annual grasses and herbs. Invasion by introduced species, associated with frequency of fire, altered the ecosystem, thus disadvantaging native species and improving conditions for even greater invasion within the Banksia woodland. Significantly higher soil phosphorus P (total) and P (HCO3) were found at PCe and PCp sites compared to GC sites. Leaf nutrient concentrations of phosphorus were significantly higher, and potassium and copper significantly lower in PCe and PCp sites, with introduced species having significantly greater concentrations than native species (except Manganese). This study demonstrated the key role of phosphorus in the Banksia woodland, in contrast to other research which identified nitrogen as the major nutrient affected by invasion. Higher levels of soil and leaf phosphorus, loss of species diversity and function, changes in fire ecology and canopy cover and a limited native soil seed bank make restoration of a structural and functional Banksia woodland from the soil seed bank alone unlikely. Without management intervention, continuing future fire is likely to result in a transition of vegetation states from GC to MC and MC to PC. The knowledge gained from this study provides a better ecological understanding of the invasive process. This enhanced understanding will enable the development of adaptive management strategies to improve conservation practices within a biodiversity hotspot and reduce the impact of the key threatening process of invasion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Banksia -- Western Australia -- Perth Region</field><field name="subject">Forest ecology -- Western Australia -- Perth Region</field><field name="subject">Fire ecology -- Western Australia -- Perth Region</field><field name="subject">Plant invasions -- Western Australia -- Perth Region</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0109</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leaf-litter and microsite on seedling recruitment in an alley-planted E. sargentii and Atriplex spp. saline agricultural system</field><field name="creator">Farrell, Claire</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In order to assess the sustainability of mixed plantings on saline land, this thesis examined the importance of leaf-litter trapping and microsites on recruitment in a salt affected alley-belted (tree/shrub) agricultural system in Western Australia. Located in the low rainfall region (MAR &lt;330 mm) of the wheatbelt, the 60 ha site consists of concentric rows of Eucalyptus sargentii trees with mounded (6 - 11 cm high) 10 -15 m inter-rows of Atriplex spp. Sustainability of this system and fulfilment of productive and ameliorative functions is dependant on successful recruitment (perennials). Although the present study site was conducted on farmland in a Mediterranean-type climate, low annual rainfall and spatial arrangement of perennial shrubs and trees, allow useful comparisons to be made with naturally occurring banded semi-arid systems and vice-versa. Of key interest were leaf-litter redistribution and trapping by tree and shrub rows and whether litter-cover/microsites facilitated/interfered with seedling recruitment (establishment, growth and survival). Litter from the tree row, redistributed by prevailing winds and rain, accumulated adjacent to saltbush seeding mounds, creating a mosaic of bare and littered areas across the site (total litter 10 t/ha over 22 months). Accumulated litter was hypothesized to differentially influence seasonal soil abiotic parameters (depending on litter-cover density) including; salinity, water availability, infiltration rates, water repellency and temperature. These abiotic conditions were also hypothesized to vary between tree and shrub microsites. Biotically, recruitment at this site was also hypothesized to be determined by interactions (positive and negative) between perennial components and understorey annuals/perennial seedlings. Accumulation of litter and resultant heterogeneity was influenced by shrub morphology, microtopography, wind direction and distance from litter source, with increased litter on the leeward sides of hemispherical Atriplex undulata shrubs and shrubs closest to tree rows. ...  The importance of tree/shrub microsites varied seasonally, with no influence in winter due to moderate temperatures and increased water availability. In warmer months saltbush mid-row microsites were most favourable for seedling recruitment due to moderate litter-cover; reducing salinity, temperatures and increasing infiltration; and reduced root-competition/shading by the tree row. Tree microsites also directly inhibited seedling recruitment through increased salinities and water repellency. However, trees also indirectly facilitated recruitment in adjacent areas through provision of leaf-litter. As litter-trapping and recruitment patterns at this site mirror those found in semi-arid natural and artificial systems, the results of this study provide useful insights into creating appropriate mimics of low rainfall natural banded woodland and chenopod shrublands. Saltbush seeding mounds, shrub morphology and litter were key components for litter trapping and recruitment heterogeneity at this site. In this tree/shrub alley planting, where litter quantities directly influence vegetation cover densities, future saline plantings need to consider appropriate tree/shrub row spacings and orientation for efficient resource (seeds, litter and water) capture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Restoration ecology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Revegetation -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Soils, Salts in -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Atriplex</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Facilitation and competition</field><field name="subject">Saltbush</field><field name="subject">Seedling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0110</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relevance of strategic human resource management (SHRM) for the growing small business</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Louise C.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The commercial developments of the late 20th and early 21st centuries have come to signify profound and far-reaching change in the way that goods and services are designed, produced, marketed and delivered to customers in the world's international and domestic markets. In order to respond to a more intensively competitive trading environment that demands ever-increasing levels of product quality, customer service, organisational efficiency and business performance, the management of business entities has undergone fundamental alteration in form and content. It is within this context that two traditionally disparate business disciplines have emerged to play an important role in the new economic commercial order, that of small business management and that of Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM). Historically eclipsed by the large and powerful mass-producing corporations, the small business sector has been more recently viewed as playing an increasingly prominent part in the creation of national and regional prosperity within the developed countries. The unprecedented interest in smaller firms and the desire to see them fulfill their economic and social potential have resulted in legislative reform and widespread initiatives by governments and other institutions designed to support and protect the smaller operators in their commercial endeavours. Similarly, in the post-industrial knowledge economy people have risen in prominence over other organisational resources as a key source of competitive commercial advantage. The role of intellectual capital in securing business success has fuelled the development of management technology and methods designed to enhance the contribution of human resources to business performance. Heralded by many as the defining managerial approach for enterprises that wish to build sustainable competitive advantage in the markets of today and the future, SHRM has come to the fore as a means to re-evaluate the importance of human contribution to business outcomes and guide management practice in leveraging the latent potential of a company's human assets. ... In general, the management of business strategy was found to possess low levels of structure and formality, effectively merging into the collective activities associated with owning and operating a small business. Similarly, when compared with the key elements of a strategic human resource management framework constructed specifically for this study, the data indicated that the strategic management of people is prevalent in smaller firms but that this again represents only partial adoption of normative models as commonly promoted for the larger business management context. It was concluded that the theoretical principles and concepts of SHRM demonstrate relevance for small companies on account of the status of the contemporary external commercial environment in which they must compete as well as the range of managerial benefits associated with strategic methodology and practice. However, currently there exist no suitable models of practice with supporting guidelines that respond to the unique contextual and operational needs and experiences typical of smaller firm owner-managers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personnel management</field><field name="subject">Small business -- Personnel management</field><field name="subject">Small business -- Western Australia -- Case studies</field><field name="subject">Strategic human resource management</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0111</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between Scylla and Charybdis : Cyprus and the problem of engineering political settlements for divided societies</field><field name="creator">Yakinthou, Christalla</field><field name="description">Conflict in deeply divided societies often has a profound impact both on the societies in which the conflict is located, and on the surrounding states and societies. Constitutional engineers working in such societies are inevitably attracted to power-sharing as a means of stabilising inter-group relations. Consociational democracy is a form of power-sharing democracy which is particularly attractive for a divided society, because its demands on the society are relatively few. It aims to separate the communities in the conflict as much as possible, while emphasising elite co-operation in the formal institutions of government. A difficulty with consociational democracy, however, is that the elite co-operation it requires to function is also required for the system to be adopted, yet will not necessarily be present. Cyprus is an excellent example of the difficulty of gaining agreement on a consociational regime for a divided society. In 1963, the consociational Republic of Cyprus collapsed as a result of mistrust between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. In 2004, a consociational system of government was designed for Cyprus by a team of UN experts under the direction of then-Secretary-General, Kofi Annan. The system of government was rejected in April 2004 at a referendum, and, consequently, was not adopted. This thesis examines why Cyprus has thus far been unable to adopt a political settlement. Failure is as hard to explain as success. Success may have many fathers and failure none, but there are as many possible causes of a failure as of a success. There is also the difficulty of the counter-factual: what facts would need to be different to produce success where experience is only of failure. The thesis systematically examines possible causes of failure, including the idea of consociational democracy itself, the particular consociational designs proposed for Cyprus, and the influence of historical aspirations and experiences. Particular attention is paid to the idea that there may be key factors which must be present before a consociational solution can be adopted. The factors, selected for this case study for their apparent relevance to Cyprus, are elite co-operation, segmental isolation, a balance of power between the disputant groups, and the ability of the international community to offer incentives for compromise. It is argued that these factors, especially elite relations and the complex web of causes which determine these, are central to an explanation of the Cyprus experience.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Political violence -- Cyprus</field><field name="subject">Ethnic conflict -- Political aspects</field><field name="subject">Elite (Social sciences) -- Cyprus</field><field name="subject">Consensus (Social sciences)</field><field name="subject">Cyprus -- Ethnic relations</field><field name="subject">Cyprus -- Government and politics</field><field name="subject">Constitutional engineering</field><field name="subject">Divided societies</field><field name="subject">Ethnic conflict</field><field name="subject">Cyprus conflict</field><field name="subject">Greek Cypriot</field><field name="subject">Annan plan</field><field name="subject">Turkish Cypriot</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0113</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grain and artificial stimulation of the rumen change the abundance and diversity of methanogens and their association with ciliates</field><field name="creator">Christophersen, Claus</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In Australia, there is pressure to reduce the amount of methane produced by ruminant livestock because they are the single largest source of methane emitted from anthropogenic sources, accounting for 70.7% of agricultural methane emissions. In addition, methane production represents a loss of gross energy intake to the animal. The organisms that are responsible for methane production in the animal gut are a distinct group of Archaea called methanogens. Methanogens occupy three different niches within the rumen. Some live freely in the rumen digesta (planktonic), others are attached to the outer surface of the rumen ciliates (ectosymbiotic), and some reside within the ciliates (endosymbiotic). The types and number of methanogens, as well as rumen ciliates and their symbiotic interactions, influence the amount of methane produced from the rumen. These factors in turn are affected by many factors, including diet and ruminal retention time. In this thesis, I tested the general hypothesis that increasing the amount of grain in the diet and reducing the retention time would affect the abundance and diversity of methanogens in their different niches, including their association with ruminal ciliates. Twenty-four fistulated sheep were used in a complete factorial design with the sheep randomly divided into four groups. ... The change in DGGE banding patterns and Shannon indices when sheep were fed grain indicated that the types of methanogens changed when sheep were fed low and high grain diets, but their diversity did not. In contrast, the diversity of rumen ciliates decreased when sheep were fed a high grain diet. A total of 18 bands from the DGGE analysis of the ciliates were sequenced. All except one, which was 98% similar to Cycloposthium sp. not found previously in the rumen, matched the sequences for previously identified rumen ciliates. Some of the rumen ciliates identified were not present in sheep fed the high grain diet. On a high grain diet, methanogens associate endosymbiotically with rumen ciliates to get better access to hydrogen. It appears that the association between methanogens and rumen ciliates is dictated by the availability of hydrogen in the rumen and not the generic composition of the ciliate population. Furthermore, endosymbiotic methanogens appear to produce less methane than methanogens in other niches. The pot scrubbers did not change ruminal retention time but they did reduce the acetate/propionate measurements observed in sheep on the high grain treatment. The reason why pot scrubbers had this effect remains unknown, but it is interesting to consider that some physical interaction has occurred between the pot scrubbers, the grain and the sheep that has improved the fermentation parameters in sheep fed a high grain diet. The results from this study have advanced our understanding of the interaction between methanogens and ruminal ciliates, and methanogenesis in the rumen in response to dietary changes and mechanical challenges. Extending this work to look more specifically at the species of methanogens that are most closely linked to high methane production and how they interact with the ruminal ciliates will be critical for manipulating enteric greenhouse gas emissions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Farm manure in methane production</field><field name="subject">Sheep -- Feeds</field><field name="subject">Rumen -- Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Endosymbiosis</field><field name="subject">Archaebacteria</field><field name="subject">Methanobacteriaceae</field><field name="subject">Methane</field><field name="subject">Greenhouse gases</field><field name="subject">Methane production</field><field name="subject">Rumen archaea (methanogens)</field><field name="subject">Rumen ciliates</field><field name="subject">Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis</field><field name="subject">Real-time PCR</field><field name="subject">Volatile fatty acids</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0114</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relevance of specific molecular and cellular effectors during murine cytomegalovirus infection</field><field name="creator">Sumaria, Nital</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The design and development of effective anti-viral immunotherapies requires a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that are involved in the generation and regulation of immune responses. The fundamental objective of the immune system is to successfully complete the task of eliminating/controlling the invading pathogen without causing overt pathology. Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are large DNA viruses that are able to evade immune attack and persist lifelong within the host. In a healthy host, CMV causes an asymptomatic infection, but in instances of decreased immune functions, such as in newborns, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients and transplant recipients, the infection can result in serious morbidity and mortality. Thus, human CMV (HCMV) is a clinically important pathogen and an understanding of the pathogenesis, mechanisms of immune subversion and, importantly the cascade of immune events that ensue following infection is highly relevant. The studies presented in this thesis have provided useful insight into various aspects of viral immunity and it is hoped that they will assist in the design of more effective therapies against viruses of clinical importance. Genetic variability in humans can greatly influence anti-viral immune responses and the outcome of viral infection. ... Furthermore, these studies provide novel evidence that NK cells are also crucial for the control of virus in some organs of susceptible mice during early acute infection. The data reveals that both NK cells and CD8+ T cells utilise perforin- and IFN-? dependent control of MCMV. Furthermore, these studies provide novel evidence that protection mediated by Ly49H+ NK cells in resistant mice is dependent on perforin. Chapter 3 focuses on the biological relevance of Grz during MCMV infection. These studies found that GrzA and GrzB are essential components of the machinery involved in limiting MCMV during acute infection. These analyses also provide the first evidence suggesting that GrzM plays a role, albeit minor, in controlling MCMV replication. Furthermore, the current studies suggest that Grz can mediate direct antiviral activities independent of the induction of cell death in conjunction with perforin. Interestingly, in the absence of both GrzA and GrzB (GrzAB), mice were as susceptible to MCMV infection as perforin-deficient mice. However, unlike perforin-deficient mice, GrzAB-deficient mice controlled and survived the infection. In Chapter 4 the roles of perforin, GrzA and GrzB in anti-viral immunity and immunopathology during MCMV infection were examined. These studies show that NK cell-derived perforin is required to eliminate infected targets as well as activated effector cells, suggesting that NK cells are crucial not only in defensive immunity but also in limiting the immune activation that follows MCMV infection. In summary, the studies presented in this thesis define the significant role played by specific effector molecules in limiting MCMV replication during different stages of this viral infection. Furthermore, these studies provide novel evidence that perforin, GrzA and GrzB play distinct roles in defensive immunity and limiting immunopathology during MCMV infection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytomegaloviruses -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Cytomegaloviruses -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Immune response -- Molecular  aspects</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Viruses</field><field name="subject">Perforin</field><field name="subject">Granzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0116</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of spatial, vertical and seasonal distribution of palynomorphs in two Perth metropolitan wetlands</field><field name="creator">Sirr, Susan</field><field name="description">Forensic Palynology has helped to solve crimes ranging from fraud to murder. Pollen is ubiquitous, almost indestructible and microscopic in size. It is often sticky and easily carried, undetected, from one place to another. As pollen is unique to a plant species, combinations of pollen types (pollen assemblages) present in soil or other samples can identify the type of environment, and often the exact location, from which a sample originated. Although Forensic Palynology has been used routinely in New Zealand for over 25 years, is commonly used in the United Kingdom and has been used in several cases in Australia in the past ten years, little research has been done in this field. In Australia, police require an initial broad palynological analysis of samples from a crime scene prior to approving a more detailed analysis. This project investigates palynological samples from two superficially similar environments that could potentially be a crime scene and alibi location, in order to determine if they can be broadly distinguished from each other. Two Perth metropolitan wetlands, Herdsman Lake and Eric Singleton Bird Sanctuary, were chosen for study as potential sites for assaults and clandestine burials. Four sites within each wetland, with correspondingly similar vegetation communities, were sampled at surface level in different seasons. At three sites, 50 cm cores were taken and sampled at seven levels to simulate shallow grave profiles. Samples were prepared and analysed using standard palynological techniques. Surface and core (grave profile) pollen assemblages were compared site by site within each wetland, and with the corresponding site of the other wetland. The grave profile assemblages for each core were combined and averaged to represent mixed 'burial assemblages', and similarly compared across and within wetlands. Palynological analysis established that the surface soil samples were characteristic of wetland environments. The different vegetation sites in each wetland, and the corresponding vegetation site in the other wetland, were broadly palynologically distinct. The season in which samples were collected was difficult to determine. Grave profile assemblages generally differed from surface samples at each site, and broadly differed across and between the two wetlands, but the differences in the 'burial assemblages' were less marked. The findings of this study confirm that broad palynological analysis can differentiate between two wetlands at surface level and downhole, and that samples at different depths in a grave should be separately analysed.

United Kingdom government educational policy, influenced by the global knowledge economy, has shifted responsibility for learning work skills from the workplace to schooling and post-compulsory education. Government policy emphasises the importance of education's role in preparing students with the skills, knowledge and understanding required to enhance the United Kingdom's competitiveness in the global market. In contrast to the work-related emphasis of the wider educational context, music education emphasises the enrichment of experience. The value of music education is related to people's needs, and the functions it performs in their lives. Music education should be transformative, creative, enriching and relevant. Participation in music education is motivated by the intrinsic satisfaction of making music, rather than the extrinsic need for work-related competencies and qualifications. Music education competes for students with other subjects in the educational marketplace when the music curriculum ceases to be compulsory at age fifteen. Therefore, it is important to understand how students relate not only to music education, but also to the wider work-related educational context in which their subject participation choices are made. Therefore, the purposes of this study are twofold: (1) to establish an overview of how students perceive music education and the factors that influence their enrolment intentions, and (2) to establish an overview of how students perceive music within the wider context of education. Statements were chosen that were considered representative of the rationales for education presented by the government and the music education community. Questionnaires and interviews were developed using the statements, and were ii administered to a random sample of Year Nine and Ten (GCSE Music and non - GCSE Music) students Music was not a relevant subject for most students. However, the perceptions of a small percentage of students (mainly Music students) did find music education relevant in the ways the literature suggested it should be. The most common influences on enrolment were perceptions of ability and enjoyment (or lack of). Despite the strong emphasis on work-related skills and qualifications in the wider educational context, students generally agreed that Music was a subject better suited to enhancing life and lifestyle than career options. However, reflecting the wider educational context, Music was perceived as being more careers/future study orientated than transformative, creative, enriching and relevant.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">General Certificate of Secondary Education</field><field name="subject">Music -- Examinations</field><field name="subject">Music -- Instruction and study -- Great Britain</field><field name="subject">Music -- Instruction and study -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Music -- Study and teaching (Secondary) -- Great Britain</field><field name="subject">Musical perception in children</field><field name="subject">Partcipation in music education</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0126</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecosystem health : the relationship between dryland salinity and human health</field><field name="creator">Speldewinde, Peter Christiaan</field><field name="description">Australia is experiencing widespread ecosystem degradation, including dryland salinity, erosion and vegetation loss. Approximately 1 million hectares (5.5%) of the south-west agricultural zone of Western Australia is affected by dryland salinity and is predicted to rise to 5.4 million hectares by 2050. Such degradation is associated with many environmental outcomes that may impact on human health, including a decrease in primary productivity, an increase in the number of invasive species, a decrease in the number of large trees, overall decrease in biodiversity, and an increase in dust production. The resulting degradation affects not only farm production but also farm values. This study examines the effects of such severe and widespread environmental degradation on the physical and mental health of residents. Western Australia has an extensive medical record database which links individual health records for all hospital admissions, cancer cases, births and deaths. For the 15 diseases examined in this project, the study area of the south west of Western Australia (excluding the capital city of Perth) contained 1,570,985 morbidity records and 27,627 mortality records for the 15 diseases examined in a population of approximately 460,000. Environmental data were obtained from the Western Australian Department of Agriculture?s soil and landscape mapping database. A spatial Bayesian framework was used to examine associations between these disease and environmental variables. The Bayesian model detected the confounding variables of socio-economic status and proportion of the population identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. With the inclusion of these confounders in the model, associations were found between environmental degradation (including dryland salinity) and several diseases with known environmentally-mediated triggers, including asthma, ischaemic heart disease, suicide and depression. However, once records of individuals who had been diagnosed with coexistent depression were removed from the analysis, the effect of dryland salinity was no longer statistically detectable for asthma, ischaemic heart disease or suicide, although the effects of socio-economic status and size of the Aboriginal population remained. The spatial component of this study showed an association between land degradation and human health. These results indicated that such processes are driving the degree of psychological ill-health in these populations, although it remains uncertain whether this 4 is secondary to overall coexisting rural poverty or some other environmental mechanism. To further investigate this complex issue an instrument designed to measure mental health problems in rural communities was developed. Components of the survey included possible triggers for mental health, including environmental factors. The interview was administered in a pilot study through a telephone survey of a small number of farmers in South-Western Australia. Using logistic regression a significant association between the mental health of male farmers and dryland salinity was detected. However, the sample size of the survey was too small to detect any statistically significant associations between dryland salinity and the mental health of women. The results of this study indicate that dryland salinity, as with other examples of ecosystem degradation, is associated with an increased burden of human disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental degradation -- Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Environmental degradation -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Soil salinization -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Rural health -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Rural mental health services -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Bayesian</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0127</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterisation of potential neuroprotective proteins induced by erythropoietin (EPO) preconditioning of cortical neuronal cultures</field><field name="creator">Boulos, Sherif</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Clinical therapeutic agents to directly inhibit ischaemic neuronal death are presently unavailable. One approach to developing therapeutics is based upon the identification of proteins up-regulated by 'preconditioning', a natural adaptive response utilised by the neural cells to counter damaging insults, such as ischaemia. Thus, my project aimed to firstly identify proteins differentially expressed following erythropoietin (EPO) mediated neuronal preconditioning and secondly to assess whether any of these proteins possessed neuroprotective activity using in vitro ischaemia like models. To achieve the first aim, it was shown that in vitro neuronal EPO preconditioning could: (i) induce cell signal changes in neuronal cultures, (ii) protect neurons against in vitro ischaemia and (iii) induce differential protein expression. Overall, 40 differentially expressed proteins were identified in cortical neuronal cultures following EPO preconditioning. In order to investigate the neuroprotective or neurodamaging activity of proteins induced by EPO preconditioning I developed an adenoviral expression system for use in neuronal cultures. To this end, I assessed the suitability of four promoters (cytomegalovirus [CMV], rous sarcoma virus [RSV], human synapsin 1 [hSYN1], rat synapsin 1 [rSYN1]) previously used to express proteins in neuronal cultures and demonstrated the superiority of the RSV promoter for this purpose. ... Finally, in order to validate this adenoviral expression system, I over-expressed the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL in neuronal cultures and subsequently confirmed its neuroprotective activity in the in vitro ischaemia and oxidative stress models used in my project. Using this adenoviral vector system and the in vitro oxidative stress model I assessed a number of proteins up-regulated by EPO preconditioning. The results of this preliminary study indicated that cyclophilin A (CyPA), peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) over-expression were neuroprotective. It was subsequently verified that adenoviral mediated over-expression of CyPA and PRDX2, v but not SOD1 in cortical neuronal cultures could protect neurons from in vitro ischaemia. I also confirmed that CyPA mRNA increased in the rat hippocampus in response to 3 minutes of global cerebral ischaemia. Interestingly, an increase in CyPA, PRDX2 or SOD1 protein was not observed in the same experimental paradigm. To investigate CyPA's mode of action I confirmed that cultured neurons, but not astrocytes, express the CyPA receptor, CD147. It was also demonstrated that administration of exogenous CyPA protein to neuronal cultures could protect neurons against oxidative and ischaemic injury. I further demonstrated that exogenous administration of CyPA induces a rapid and transient activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway in neuronal cultures. From this observation, I have proposed that the extracellular mediated neuroprotective activity of CyPA occurs via CD147 receptor signalling and activation of ERK1/2 pro-survival pathways. Based on the findings reported in this thesis, the neuroprotective activities of PRDX2 and CyPA warrant further investigation as targets for the development of new therapies to treat cerebral ischaemia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteins -- Identification</field><field name="subject">Cerebral ischemia -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Neurons</field><field name="subject">Cell death</field><field name="subject">Erythropoietin</field><field name="subject">Neuroprotective proteins</field><field name="subject">Cortical neuronal cultures</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0128</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small, no-take marine protected areas and wave exposure affect temperate, subtidal reef communities at Marmion Marine Park, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Kylie A.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The ecological effects of marine protected areas (MPAs) in temperate ecosystems are poorly understood relative to their tropical counterparts. The limited number of rigorous empirical studies supporting existing theoretical models, increasing public awareness of the importance of marine conservation strategies and legislative requirements to review management effectiveness provide further impetus to study temperate MPAs. Investigations should consider confounding effects of natural variability if MPA effects are to be clearly demonstrated. This research helps to address these needs by investigating the short term effects of sanctuary zones (no-take MPAs where fishing is prohibited) and wave exposure at Marmion Marine Park, Western Australia. The three sanctuary zones at Marmion Marine Park are extremely small (0.061  0.279 km2) compared to most reported in the literature. The sanctuary zones are nested within a larger, fished zone (94.95 km2). The sanctuary zones have been protected from fishing since the year 2000. A post-hoc, asymmetrical sampling design was used in this study and involved surveys of fishes, mobile invertebrates and macroalgae at one sanctuary zone and two fished sites (controls) at each of three successive, subtidal reef lines. The three reef lines are exposed to a gradient in wave energy. The size structure and abundance of the heavily exploited Panulirus cygnus (Western Rock Lobster) were positively affected by protection from fishing in sanctuary zones, despite the highly mobile nature of this migratory species. The mean abundance of legal size lobsters was higher in sanctuary zones compared to fished sites during an interannual study (2003, 2005 and 2006). The total abundance of lobsters and the mean abundance of legal size lobsters were higher at inshore and offshore sanctuary zones compared to fished control sites during a 2005/2006 fishing season study. These zoning effects did not vary with the time of survey. ... Furthermore, the abundance of large lobsters in sanctuary zones decreased with the duration of the 2005/2006 fishing season. Similarly, it is likely that sanctuary zones are too small relative to the movement of fishes to adequately protect stocks of some targeted species. The small sanctuary zones at Marmion are unlikely to offer protection to highly mobile species over the long term. And finally, ecological assemblages within each level of wave exposure are distinct. Consequently for each assemblage type, the current reserve design does not include replication of sanctuary zones and does not offer any 'insurance' in the event of isolated impacts affecting a particular zone. This study has identified the benefits and deficiencies of the design and function of small no-take temperate MPAs in Western Australia. An increase in the size and number of sanctuary zones within each wave exposure level will help to address the v shortfalls of the zoning scheme and enhance the conservation benefits of management at Marmion Marine Park. More generally, this study demonstrates that the mobility of the species to be protected from fishing should be considered when designing MPAs. Lessons learned from this work will be beneficial for the future management and conservation of resources in the region and elsewhere.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marmion Marine Park (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Marine parks and reserves -- Western Australia -- Marmion</field><field name="subject">Reef ecology -- Western Australia -- Marmion</field><field name="subject">Marine resources conservation -- Western Australia -- Marmion</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0130</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elucidating novel aspects of hypothalamic releasing hormone receptor regulation</field><field name="creator">Dromey, Jasmin Rachel</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) form one of the largest superfamilies of cell-surface receptors and respond to a vast range of stimuli including light, hormones and neurotransmitters. Although structurally similar, GPCRs are regulated by many diverse proteins, which allow the specific functions of each receptor to be carried out. This thesis focussed on two well-documented GPCRs, the thyrotropin releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), which control the thyroid and reproductive endocrine pathways respectively. Although each of these anterior pituitary receptors is responsible for distinct physiological responses, both are integral to normal development and homeostasis. This thesis focused on three areas of GPCR regulation: ?-arrestin recruitment, transcription factor regulation and receptor up-regulation. The role of the cytoplasmic protein, ?-arrestin, has perhaps been previously underestimated in GPCR regulation, but it is now increasingly apparent that ?-arrestins not only inhibit further G-protein activation and assist in GPCR internalisation but also act as complex scaffolding platforms to mediate and amplify downstream signalling networks for hours after initial GPCR activation. It is therefore becoming increasingly important to be able to monitor such complexes in live cells over longer time-frames. ... Members of the E2F transcription family have been previously identified by this laboratory as potential GnRHR interacting proteins, via a yeast-2-hybrid screen and BRET. This thesis further investigated the role of E2F family members and demonstrates that a range of GPCRs are able to activate E2F transcriptional activity when stimulated by agonist. However, despite GnRHR displaying robust E2F transcriptional activation upon agonist stimulation, this did not result in any conclusive evidence for functional regulation, although it is possible E2F may modulate and assist in GnRHR trafficking. Furthermore it is apparent that E2F family members are highly redundant, as small effects in GnRHR binding and cell growth were only observed when protein levels of both E2F4 and E2F5 were altered. During the course of the investigation into the effect of E2F transcription on GPCR function, it was evident that long-term agonist stimulation of GnRHR had a profound effect on its expression. As this was explored further, it became clear that this agonist-induced up-regulation was both dose- and time-dependent. Furthermore, altering levels of intracellular calcium and receptor recycling/synthesis could modulate GnRHR up-regulation. In addition, an extremely sensitive CCD camera has been used for the first time to visualise the luciferase activity attributed to GnRHR up-regulation. Overall, this thesis demonstrates the complex nature of GPCR regulation. For the first time, long-term BRET analysis on ?-arrestin interactions with both classes of GPCRs has been examined in a variety of cellular formats. This has given valuable insights into the roles of phosphorylation and internalisation on ?-arrestin interaction. Additionally, this thesis has revealed that prolonged agonist exposure increases receptor expression levels, which has major implications for drug therapy regimes in the treatment of endocrine-related disorders and tumours.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Endocrinology</field><field name="subject">Hypothalamic hormones</field><field name="subject">Thyrotropin releasing hormone -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">Gonadotropin releasing hormone -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">Endocrine glands -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">GPCR</field><field name="subject">BRET</field><field name="subject">?-arrestin</field><field name="subject">GPCR function and regulation</field><field name="subject">Up-regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0133</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cerium chloride inhibition for high strength low alloy steel exposed to sulphide polluted seawater</field><field name="creator">Coimbatore Dhandayuth, Venkatesh</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Corrosion of steel structures caused by sulphide is a common engineering problem encountered by many industries, such as the petroleum, chemical processing, mining and mineral processing industries. The control of sulphide corrosion is still a controversial topic among corrosion engineers. There is an absence of guideline for a reliable acceptable limit of sulphide level in service and each processing industry has its own empirical values. Selection of inhibitors in the sulphide environment depends on laboratory testing before its actual application in pipelines and reaction vessels. Many investigators have postulated the corrosion mechanisms due to sulphide based on operating envelopes such as pH, chloride, manganese, hydrogen sulphide, sulphate reducing bacteria levels and inhibitor concentration. It is recommended in the literature that the batch dosing of inhibitor and biocide needs to be evaluated in regards to sulphide reducing bacteria (SRB) level, which may produce sulphide concentrations up to 2000 ppm. Although sulphide scale formation may protect the base metal by providing a physical barrier, the detrimental effects of sulphide are often inevitable, such as stress corrosion cracking, hydrogen embrittlement, etc. Currently, there are many chemicals that are used as inhibitors to prevent corrosion by scavenging the sulphide from the environment. Cerium, a rare-earth element, is not used as inhibitor in the sulphide environment. Also, there are no previous research findings on the effects of compounds of rare-earth metals, such as cerium chloride (CeCl3), in sulphide environment. This research examines the corrosion behaviour of 0.4Mo-0.8Cr steel, a High Strength Low Alloy (HSLA) steel, in sulphide-polluted artificial seawater with the addition of CeCl3 and glutaraldehyde. ... It is postulated that the moderate inhibiting effect of CeCl3 is due to the scavenging effect thereby forming Ce2S3 complex. Further reaction of sulphide with steel resulted in ferrous sulphide, leading to an increased corrosion rate. It is also concluded that the CeCl3 interferes with both anodic and cathodic reactions in deaerated conditions. Addition of glutaraldehyde in the sulphide-polluted seawater was found to decrease the corrosion rate. According to the electrochemical measurements conducted, the concurrent addition of glutaraldehyde and CeCl3 appeared to have an added effect on reducing the corrosion of the steel, as evidenced by the increase of the open circuit potential during the short-term testing. From the weight loss measurements after 60 days, sulphide pollution in deaerated seawater was found to increase corrosion rate. This is attributed to the increase of sulphide activity whereby continual dissolution of steel was encountered. From the weight loss tests, it was found that the addition of CeCl3 and glutaraldehyde reduced the corrosion rate of the steel in the solutions containing 0-10 ppm sulphide. There is no noticeable corrosion rate decrease for the solution containing 100 ppm sulphide. The added effect of CeCl3 and glutaraldehyde to the SRB medium has resulted in lower corrosion rates. Further detailed experimentation is required to elucidate the corrosion reduction mechanism in glutaraldehyde-containing environments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cerium chloride</field><field name="subject">Metal sulphides</field><field name="subject">Seawater corrosion</field><field name="subject">Steel alloys -- Corrosion</field><field name="subject">Sulphides -- Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Corrosion</field><field name="subject">Sulphide corrosion</field><field name="subject">Steel</field><field name="subject">Corrosion inhibitor</field><field name="subject">Electrochemical technique</field><field name="subject">Cerium chloride</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0134</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dietary risk factors for prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia</field><field name="creator">Ambrosini, Gina L</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis examines the potential role of dietary intake in the development of two common conditions affecting the prostate gland; prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Diet is of interest as a potential risk factor for prostate cancer because of geographical variations in prostate cancer incidence and increased prostate cancer risks associated with migration from Asian to western countries. Some geographical variation has been suggested for BPH, but this is less certain. However, both prostate cancer and BPH have potential links with diet through their positive associations with sex hormone levels, metabolic syndrome, increased insulin levels and chronic inflammation. In addition, zinc is an essential dietary micronutrient required for semen production in the prostate gland. The original work for this thesis is presented in six manuscripts of which, four have been published in peer-reviewed journals (at the time of thesis completion). BPH investigated in this thesis is defined as surgically-treated BPH. The following hypotheses were investigated. Regarding foods, nutrients and the risk of prostate cancer and BPH: 1. Increasing intakes of fruits, vegetables and zinc are inversely associated with the risk of prostate cancer and BPH 2. Increasing intakes of total fat and calcium are positively associated with the risk of prostate cancer and BPH. 3. Dietary patterns characterised by high meat, processed meat, calcium and fat content are positively associated with the risk of prostate cancer and BPH. 4. Dietary patterns characterised by high fruit and vegetable and low meat content are inversely associated with the risk of prostate cancer and BPH. v Regarding methodological issues related to the study of diet-disease relationships: 5. Dietary patterns (overall diet) elicited from principal components analysis yield stronger diet-disease associations than when studying isolated nutrients. 6. Remotely recalled dietary intake is reliable enough to be used in studies of chronic disease with long latency periods, such as prostate cancer and BPH. Methods: Data from two studies was used to address the hypotheses above. ... Based on the literature reviewed and the original work for this thesis, the most important dietary risk factors for prostate cancer and BPH appear to be those common to western style diets, i.e. diets high in red meat, processed meat, refined grains, dairy products, and low in fruit and vegetables. This type of diet is likely to result in marginal intakes of antioxidants and fibre, excess intakes of fat and possibly, moderate intakes of carcinogens associated with processed meat and meat cooked at high temperatures. These dietary factors have been linked with biomarkers of inflammation, and they support the hypotheses that chronic inflammation is involved in the development of both prostate cancer and BPH. In addition, this work builds on evidence that zinc is an important factor in prostate health. There is scope for more investigation into the reliability of dietary patterns and the use of nutrient patterns as an alternative to focussing on single food components. Further studies on the reliability of remote dietary intake would also be useful. Because of the latency of chronic disease, it can be theorised that remote dietary recall may uncover more robust diet-disease relationships.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Benign prostatic hyperplasia</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Nutritional aspects</field><field name="subject">Nutritionally induced diseases</field><field name="subject">Prostate -- Cancer -- Nutritional aspects</field><field name="subject">Prostate -- Hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">&lt;keyword&gt;</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0135</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The poem as liminal place-moment :  John Kinsella, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Christopher Dewdney and Eavan Boland</field><field name="creator">Reed, Marthe</field><field name="description">Places are deeply specific, and often richly resonant for us in terms of memory, emotion, and association, yet we nevertheless frequently move through them insensible of their constitution and diversity, or the shaping influences they have upon our lives.

The synthesis, stereochemistry, physical properties and functionalisation of 'sarcophagines' and their metal complexes are discussed. A brief overview of the burgeoning field of metallopolymers is given with specific mention of the synthetic routes to pendant metallopolymers, and how these could be employed to prepared cage amine containing metallopolymers. Chapter 2 deals with the synthesis, characterisation and reactivity of cinnamylamino and styrylamido derivatives of the cage amines [Co((NH2)2sar)]3+, [Co((CH3)(NH2)sar)]3+ and [Cu((NH2)2sar)]2+. The cinnamylamino derivatives were prepared using reductive alkylation of the aforementioned amines with cinnamaldehyde. Procedures were developed to isolate the complexes without causing unwanted additions to the double bond. The cinnamylamino derivatives displayed unexpected reactivity towards a range of reducing agents, resulting in unexpected reduction of the double bond and cleavage of the cinnamyl group, but ultimately in the preparation of phenylpropylamino derivatives of [Co((NH2)2sar)]3+ and [Co((CH3)(NH2)sar)]3+. Attempts to rationalise the reactivity of the double bond have been explored based upon the physical properties and reactivity of the double bond. The styrylamido derivatives were prepared by treatment of the cage amines with 4-vinylbenzoyl chloride, and the complexes isolated in a similar manner to those of the cinnamylamino derivatives to ensure the amide linkage remained intact. Most of the complexes have been structurally characterised. ...  Both the 2-thienyl and 3-thienyl derivatives of [Co((NH2)2sar)]3+ and [Co((CH3)(NH2)sar)]3+ have been prepared using reductive alkylation with the respective carboxaldehydes of thiophene. One of the optically pure isomers has been prepared. The complexes have been fully characterised including structural characterisation. Polymerisation of the thiophene-cage amine complexes was investigated under a range of chemical and electrochemical conditions, though polymerisation was never observed. Cleavage of the thienyl groups was observed when ceric ammonium nitrate in nitric acid was used as the oxidant. The attachment of oligothiophenes and mixed pyrrole-thiophene oligomers to cage amines were investigated using reductive alkylation and various pyrrole ring-forming reactions about the apical amino groups, though none of the desired complexes were isolated, reasons for the lack of reactivity were discussed. An efficient synthesis of N-(4-benzoic acid)- 2,5-di(2-thienyl)pyrrole was developed and was shown to the electropolymerisable, albeit the polymer films were non-conducting. Attempts to couple N-(4-benzoic acid)- 2,5-di(2-thienyl)pyrrole with a cage amine via its acid chloride were complicated by decomposition reactions, the nature of one of these products is discussed.

The increasing disease burden with the potential for the development of medical co-morbidities has implications for future health care provision. This thesis adds to the understanding of the medical complications of overweight and obesity in childhood. Design and Aims: Two different, but related, research studies are reported. The first study is a cross-sectional study, designed to quantify the medical complications of childhood obesity in primary school-aged children in Western Australia. This study aims to identify the medical complications of primary school children with overweight/obesity. The study also aims to compare the medical complications of obesity in a community sample who have never sought treatment with a clinical sample who are actively seeking treatment for overweight/obesity. Finally, this study also aims to examine the relationship between the medical complications of childhood obesity and a continuum of children's Body Mass Index z-scores, including those in the normal range. The second study is an exercise intervention study to investigate the effect of exercise on one specific medical complication of obesity, namely insulin resistance. This study aims to determine if a structured eight-week exercise program significantly changes insulin resistance in obese children, and to determine if this decrease in insulin resistance is associated with changes in body composition and inflammatory markers. ... Conclusion: The prevalence of the medical complications of overweight and obesity in primary school children indicates that all children should have body mass index regularly checked from a young age. Children who are overweight/obese should be screened for the presence of co-morbidities despite a young age. Parents and health professionals needs to be educated that childhood obesity is associated with medical co-morbidities and is not simply a social or cosmetic concern. The continuous nature of the BMI z-score/co-morbidities relationship suggests that public health and health education strategies should include adopting a populationbased approach to weight management. This continuous relationship means that even in the normal BMI spectrum, the risk of developing co-morbidities rises with increasing BMI. Such an approach would encourage maintenance of normal weight for all children, rather than targeting overweight/obese children only. Increased activity and decreased sedentary behaviours should be recommended for all children in line with the population-based public health approach suggested above. However, exercise has a specific role in weight management strategies for overweight/obese children, and in management strategies for adiposityrelated co-morbidities. Significant metabolic benefits of exercise occur in the absence of changes in body shape and weight. After an exercise program, simple blood investigations (such as lipid profiles, fasting insulin and OGTTs) are likely to miss important metabolic improvements and anthropometry (BMI calculation, waist circumference) may be more indicative of potential metabolic improvement and decreased co-morbidity risk.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obesity -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Obesity in adolescence -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Obesity in children -- Complications</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0139</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of country and higher education images in mainland Chinese students' intention to enroll in a offshore program</field><field name="creator">Li, Jianyao</field><field name="description">Offshore programs have become increasingly popular in countries that are experiencing rapid economic growth and rising demand for higher education. There is no doubt that China is one of the largest markets for offshore programs. However, the offshore program market in China has become increasingly competitive. Currently, institutions from the USA, the UK, and Australia, to name just a few, are offering offshore programs ranging from the professional diploma level to higher degrees such as MA, MBA and PhD. Therefore, understanding how Chinese students select an offshore program is important for competing and surviving in this market place. This study examines the effects of image (i.e., country image and higher education image), attitude, subject norm and perceived behavior control (adopted from Ajzen's theory of planned behavior) in Chinese students' enrollment intentions towards offshore programs from Australia, the UK and the USA respectively. A total number of 1291 valid questionnaires were collected from China for this study. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method was used for data analyses and modeling. This PhD's several major findings have significant theoretical and practical implication. One of the major findings was that country image or its related higher education image doesn't have significant effect on an offshore program evaluation in China. This finding has contradicted most previous studies which suggested that country image had significant impact on whether a consumer purchases the products or brands from a foreign country. The difference between this study and the other country-image studies may be due to the fact that this study studied multiple factors besides country image, while the other studies looked at only the effect of country image on purchasing intention. Although country image or higher education image did not play any significant role in offshore program enrollments, this study found that the image of the partnering or local institution had a significant effect on enrollment intention. Because Chinese students are unfamiliar with a foreign country or their higher education system, they relied heavily on the local institution (e.g., its reputation and quality) to evaluate an offshore program. The findings with respective to image have challenged most previous studies on country image and open a new arena for looking at the effect of country image in behavioral intention. Practically speaking, these findings make universities rethink their offshore program strategies in foreign countries, particularly developing countries. Most university marketers from western countries emphasize on the characteristics of its own (such as the history of the university, the quality of research) when promoting its offshore program overseas. However, this study suggested that the focus should be placed on selecting a good and suitable local partner, as well as emphasizing the characteristics of the local partner. Other major findings were related to the Theory of Planned behavior. This study found that all three components of the TPB, namely, attitude towards the program, subject norm and perceived behavior control had significant effects on enrollment intention. This suggested that for predicting behavioral intention in educational program enrollment, the TPB is a very powerful model.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Students, Foreign</field><field name="subject">College students -- China</field><field name="subject">Chinese students -- Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges -- Marketing</field><field name="subject">Country image</field><field name="subject">Higher education image</field><field name="subject">Chinese student</field><field name="subject">Local institution image</field><field name="subject">Enrollment intention</field><field name="subject">Offshore program</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0140</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant growth and nutrient removal in simulated secondary-treated municipal wastewater in wetland microcosmos</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Zhenhua</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The use of constructed wetlands for tertiary purification of municipal wastewater has received increasing attention around the world because direct discharge of secondary-treated municipal wastewater to water bodies has caused eutrophication. Plant species selection and vegetation management may enhance nutrient removal efficiency in constructed wetlands. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the relations between plant growth and nutrient removal efficiency in constructed wetlands. The objective of this study is to better understand how plant growth and resource allocation are influenced by nutrients in wastewater and how nutrient removal efficiencies are affected by plant species and vegetation management. The preliminary experiment was conducted to select macrophytes, especially ornamental species, to grow in the wastewater in the wetland microcosms. Ten plant species, comprising six ornamental species: Alocasia macrorrhiza, Canna indica, Iris louisiana, Lythrum sp., Zantedeschia aethiopica, Zantedeschia sp., and four sedge species: Baumea articulate, Baumea juncea, Carex tereticaulis and Schoenoplectus validus, were planted in the wetland microcosms and fed a simulated wastewater solution in the concentrations similar to the secondary-treated municipal wastewater. C. indica has shown vigorous and healthy growth, and a relatively high potential of rooting-zone aeration and nutrient removal efficiency. B. articulata and S. validus also showed relatively high nutrient removal efficiency. ... The high nutrient availability and optimum N/P ratio were required for stimulating plant growth, resulting in allocation of more resources to above-ground tissues compared to below-ground parts, and enhancing nutrient removal efficiency. Nutrient removal efficiencies were significantly influenced by growth of C. indica and S. validus, nutrient loading rates and N/P ratios in the wastewater. The nutrient uptake kinetics of C. indica and S. validus were investigated to elucidate the differences in nutrient uptake between species. Wetland plant species have shown differential nutrient uptake efficiency and different preferences for inorganic N source, with C. indica preferring NO3-N and S. validus preferring NH4-N. C. indica had greater capacity than S. validus to take up PO4-P when the concentration of PO4-P in the solution was relatively low, whereas S. validus was more capable than C. indica to take up NO3-N when the concentration of NO3-N in the solution was relatively low. The PO4-P uptake capacity was higher in younger than older plants. Overall, the study has suggested that different plant species have differential capacity to take up nutrients. In addition to nutrient uptake, plants have significant other roles in terms of nutrient removal from the wastewater (such as leaking oxygen into the rhizosphere in which oxidation of substances like ammonia can occur). The properly high nutrient availability and optimum N/P ratio are required to stimulate the plant growth, resulting in enhancing the treatment performance in the wetlands. These findings have important implications for improving our ability to engineer ecological solutions to the problems associated with nutrient-rich wastewater.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Constructed wetlands</field><field name="subject">Sewage -- Purification -- Biological treatment</field><field name="subject">Sewage -- Purification -- Nitrogen removal</field><field name="subject">Sewage -- Purification -- Nutrient removal</field><field name="subject">Nutrient pollution of water</field><field name="subject">Water reuse</field><field name="subject">Eutrophication -- Control</field><field name="subject">Schoenoplectus validus</field><field name="subject">Canna indica</field><field name="subject">Plant growth</field><field name="subject">Wastewater</field><field name="subject">Nutrient removal</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0141</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental influences on the spatial and temporal distribution of soil macrofauna in a smallholder agriforestry system of western Honduras</field><field name="creator">Pauli, Natasha</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the findings of an investigation of the spatial and temporal distribution of soil macrofauna at multiple scales within smallholder agriforestry fields in a remote, mountainous area of western Honduras. Since 1990, smallholder farmers in the study area have switched from traditional slash-and-burn agriculture to a form of slash-and-mulch agriforestry based on cultivating maize, beans and sorghum amongst dispersed trees. The principal objective was to examine the influence of the slash-and-mulch agricultural system on soil macrofauna abundance, biomass and community composition, and relate soil macrofauna distribution patterns to environmental variables. The initial stage of the research comprised transect-based sampling of soil macrofauna and biophysical variables in four common land uses of the study area. All four land uses (secondary forest, young milpa (agriforestry), mature milpa, and pasture) supported abundant, diverse and heterogeneous soil macrofauna communities, with few notable differences in soil macrofauna distribution among land uses. The most abundant soil macrofauna taxa were termites, ants, earthworms and beetles. Of the 'explanatory' environmental variables that were measured (including land use and selected soil properties, vegetation characteristics and topographic variables), those that had the strongest relationships with soil macrofauna abundance were land use, tree density and soil organic matter content. The second stage of the research was spatially-orientated and used stratified sampling based on within-field differences in farmer-defined soil type, as well as grid-based sampling of soil macrofauna surface activity. There was substantial within-field variation in soil type and topography, which was related to distribution patterns of at least one agriculturally-important soil macrofauna taxon. Earthworm activity was higher in areas of fertile soil and lower slope positions. At a finer scale, there was a positive spatial correlation between tree distribution and earthworm casting activity. The final phase situated the biophysical research in the local socio-economic context through participant observation and interviews with farmers. The results of the three phases of the study were incorporated into an original conceptual model of the relationships among soil macrofauna and environmental variables in the study area across multiple spatial scales and along a chronosequence of land use changes. Specific pointers are provided for further research on the role of soil fauna in influencing soil structure, nutrient cycling and pest species abundance, and for further investigating local knowledge and the socio-economic and cultural drivers of land use change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural systems -- Honduras</field><field name="subject">Soil biology</field><field name="subject">Soil structure</field><field name="subject">Soil macrofauna</field><field name="subject">Honduras</field><field name="subject">Soil biodiversity</field><field name="subject">Central America</field><field name="subject">Smallholder agriculture</field><field name="subject">Agriforestry</field><field name="subject">Spatial ecology</field><field name="subject">Local knowledge</field><field name="subject">Land use change</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0142</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integral metatheory for organisational transformation</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Mark Gerard</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a metatheory for the study of organisational transformation. A metatheory is a coherent conceptual system that analyses and accommodates the insights of other theory. In a time of rapidly changing organisational, societal and global environments there is a strong imperative for developing integrative conceptual frameworks that contribute to our understanding and explanation of transformational change. Like other areas of social science, the field of organisational transformation is made up of a multitude of diverse theories that offer useful and valid insights into aspects of transformational phenomena. These theories come from many different theoretical schools and research paradigms and they employ a wide range of explanatory concepts. There are however, no overarching theoretical frameworks specifically developed from metatheory building techniques that might give an overall coherency to the field. Consequently, there is no way of deciding on the relative conceptual merits of particular theories and there is often little justification for adopting one theory over another to explore some aspect of organisational transformation. To fill this gap, this thesis uses conceptual research methods to i) review extant literature, ii) develop a metatheory for organisational transformation and iii) apply this metatheory to the exemplar topic of organisational sustainability. The initial chapters introduce the topics of organisational transformation and metatheory building and provide a rationale for an overarching approach to radical organisational change. Following this, a method for metatheory building is developed and its application in this study is described. A rationale for the sampling procedure and organisational of data is also presented. The metatheory building method involves the use of conceptual theme analysis for identifying the core themes theorists use in describing and explaining organisational transformation. In subsequent chapters, core themes are analysed using the techniques of bridging and bracketing to derive a number of conceptual lenses. These lenses, and the relationships between them, form the central components for the integral metatheory. Having identified and described the basic set of conceptual lenses for transformation, the exemplar topic of organisational sustainability is used to show how the metatheory can be applied to a specific area of research. The final chapter evaluates the integral metatheory with some commonly used criteria for judging the results of conceptual research. A brief evaluation of the chief metatheoretical resource used in the study, i.e., AQAL metatheory, is also carried out. This thesis endeavours to contribute to the field of organisational, transformational and sustainability studies by i) developing a metatheoretical framework for the study of radical organisational change, ii) offering a comprehensive review of paradigms and theories of organisational transformation and their core explanatory concepts, and iii) proposing a more detailed metatheory building method which can make a significant contribution to the conceptual development of many fields within organisational studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Management science</field><field name="subject">Metatheory</field><field name="subject">Organizational change</field><field name="subject">Organizational change -- Management</field><field name="subject">Organisational transformation</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Integral theory</field><field name="subject">Metatheory</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0145</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The best of Santalum album : essential oil composition, biosynthesis and genetic diversity in the Australian tropical sandalwood collection</field><field name="creator">Jones, Christopher G.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] An investigation into the causes of heartwood and essential oil content of Australian plantation sandalwood, Santalum album was undertaken. Genetic diversity of 233 S. album, five S. austrocaledonicum and fifteen S. macgregorii trees growing in the Forest Products Commission arboretum, Kununurra WA, was assessed using nuclear and chloroplast RFLPs. Santalum spicatum was chosen as an out-group. Nuclear genetic diversity of the S. album collection was very low, with observed and expected heterozygosity levels of 0.047. This was lower than the results previously reported in the literature for trees in India, however a different technique was used. Based on allelic patterns, the collection was able to be categorised into 19 genotypes; each representing some shared genetic origin. Some groups were highly redundant with 56 trees being represented, while others were populated by just one tree. The essential oil yield and heartwood contents of trees from these genetic groups were compared. Yields were highly variable both within and between groups of trees which share a common genetic history, suggesting a significant environmental component was contributing to the observed phenotype, despite identical soil and climatic conditions. Ancestral lineages were tested using chloroplast RFLPs, although a lack of shared mutations between species made this difficult. Only one S. album tree originating from Timor was resolved using nuclear RFLPs, with the other trees being grouped with material sourced from India. There was no resolution of Indian S. album from Timorese using chloroplast RFLPs, however one S. album tree grown from Indian seed possessed a single unique mutation. The low genetic diversity of the Australian S. album collection is likely to be a combination of incomplete seed sourcing and highly restricted gene flow during the evolution of the species. Combined with information gathered on the phylogeny of the genus by other researchers, S. album is postulated to have originated from an over-sea dispersal out of northern Australia or Papua New Guinea 3 to 5 million years ago. Essential oil yield and composition was assessed for 100 S. album trees growing in the collection, ranging in age from 8 to 17 years. Oil content of heartwood ranged from 30 mg g-1 to 60 mg g-1, and the transition zone 36 mg g-1 to 90 mg g-1. Sapwood contained almost no sesquiterpene oils. Despite the highly variable total oil yields, the chemical profile of the oil did not vary, suggesting there was limited genetic diversity within this region of the genome. Strong, positive correlations existed between v sesquiterpenoids in the essential oil of S. album. ... These represent the first TPS genes to be isolated from sandalwood and will enable further elucidation of oil biosynthesis genes. This thesis compiles a three-pronged approach to understanding the underlying causes of oil yield variation in S. album. As a species for which so little is known, the research presented here provides a major leap forward for tree improvement, breeding and silviculture. Hence the best of Santalum album research is presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Santalenes</field><field name="subject">Sandalwood oil industry -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Biogeography</field><field name="subject">Plant genetics</field><field name="subject">Heartwood</field><field name="subject">Essences and essential oils</field><field name="subject">Sesquiterpenes</field><field name="subject">Biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Santalum album</field><field name="subject">Santalum austrocaledonicum</field><field name="subject">Santalum macgregorii</field><field name="subject">Santalum spicatum</field><field name="subject">Genetic diversity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0146</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An e-discourse framework for the qualitative analysis of inquiry-based web forums</field><field name="creator">Abdul Samad, Adlina</field><field name="description">#DEFAULT</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Higher -- Computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">Education, Higher -- Effect of technological innovations on -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Educational technology -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Internet in higher education -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">E-learning</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0147</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">No-suicide contracts, no-suicide agreements and no-suicide assurances : an exploratory study of their nature, utilization and perceived effectiveness</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Stephen J.</field><field name="description">The research examined mental health practitioners' attitudes towards, satisfaction with and use of suicide prevention contracting (SPC) techniques. Survey respondents comprised consultant psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, mental health nurses, psychologists, registered medical officers and social workers. A self-report questionnaire was mailed to 1347 potential respondents, together with three follow-up letters sent out at two-week intervals. There was a 31% response rate, producing 420 valid questionnaires. The results of the research re-confirm the historical trajectory of SPC, from its early beginnings as a relationship-based suicide-risk assessment technique to one that is used in contemporary practice by practitioners to meet a range of objectives. The research focused on three SPC techniques in operation in clinical practice: verbal no-suicide assurances, no-suicide agreements, and written no-suicide contracts. Analysis of the data suggests a number of important findings. The first of these is that practitioners perceive different utility among these three techniques. Secondly, the least experienced practitioners were significantly less likely to use no-suicide contracts, despite seeing more suicidality and having more formal training in the use of the technique. Thirdly, a practitioner's gender, and formal training were significant in the perception and application of SPC techniques. Finally, suicidal behaviours and completed suicide was a clinical outcome in some situations irrespective of the use and non-use of SPC. The findings of this research are used to provide an emerging conceptual framework and associated nomenclature that inform clinical decision-making in relation to SPC. In addition, a conceptual model is presented which demonstrates that the potential for injudicious use of SPC techniques is as much precipitated by individual factors as it is by broader environmental factors. Key words: no-suicide contracts, suicide prevention contracts, no-suicide agreements, no-suicide decisions, contingency contracting.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Suicide -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Suicidal behaviour -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Mental health counseling</field><field name="subject">Mental health personnel</field><field name="subject">Suicide prevention contracting</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0149</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Birth pains : changing understandings of miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death in Australia in the Twentieth Century</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Susannah Ruth</field><field name="description">Feminist and social historians have long been interested in that particularly female ability to become pregnant and bear children. A significant body of historiography has challenged the notion that pregnancy and childbirth  considered to be the acceptable and 'appropriate' roles for women for most of the twentieth century in Australia - have always been welcomed, rewarding and always fulfilling events in women's lives. Several historians have also begun the process of enlarging our knowledge of the changing cultural attitudes towards bereavement in Australia and the eschewing of the public expression of sorrow following the two World Wars; a significant contribution to scholarship which underscores the changing attitudes towards perinatal loss. It is estimated that one in four women lose a pregnancy to miscarriage, and two in one hundred late pregnancies result in stillbirth in contemporary Australia. Miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death are today considered by psychologists and social workers, amongst others, as potentially significant events in many women's lives, yet have received little or passing attention in historical scholarship concerned with pregnancy and motherhood. As such, this study focuses on pregnancy loss: the meaning it has been given by various groups at different times in Australia's past, and how some Australian women have made sense of their own experience of miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death within particular social and historical contexts. Pregnancy loss has been understood in a range of ways by different groups over the past 100 years. At the beginning of the twentieth century, when alarm was mounting over the declining birth rate, pregnancy loss was termed 'foetal wastage' by eugenicists and medical practitioners, and was seen in abstract terms as the loss of necessary future Australian citizens. By the 1970s, however, with the advent of support groups such as SANDS (Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Support) miscarriage and stillbirth were increasingly seen as the devastating loss of an individual baby, while the mother was seen as someone in need of emotional and other support. With the advent of new prenatal screening technologies in the late twentieth century, there has been a return of the idea of maternal responsibility for producing a 'successful' outcome. This project seeks to critically examines the wide range of socially constructed meanings of pregnancy loss and interrogate the arguments of those groups, such as the medical profession, religious and support groups, participating in these constructions. It will build on existing histories of motherhood, childbirth and pregnancy in Australia and, therefore, also the history of Australian women.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Miscarriage</field><field name="subject">Stillbirth</field><field name="subject">Newborn infants -- Death</field><field name="subject">Women -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Women -- Australia -- History -- 21st century</field><field name="subject">Women -- Australia -- Oral history</field><field name="subject">Motherhood -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Feminist history</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0150</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antenatal bladder outflow obstruction : effects of morphology and apoptosis in the fetal kidney, and effects on fetal ACTH and cortisol levels in an ovine model</field><field name="creator">Samnakay, Naeem</field><field name="description">Posterior urethral valves cause bladder outflow obstruction and damage to the developing fetal kidney. Posterior urethral valves affect 1 in 8000 new-born males. A third of these children develop end stage renal failure by adolescence, despite valve ablation in the early post-natal period, implying that majority of the damage to the kidneys occurs in utero. How does this damage occur, and should we intervene in utero? The answers to these questions require further research, and are the basis to this thesis. This thesis focused on the effect bladder outflow obstruction has on morphology and apoptosis in the fetal kidney in a fetal lamb model. It also looked at the effect of bladder outflow obstruction on fetal stress hormone levels. Bladder outflow obstruction was created surgically in fetal lambs at day 70 of gestation, and fetal kidneys were analysed at day 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 after creation of obstruction. Controls undergoing sham surgery were used for comparison. Four aspects were investigated: - effects of bladder outflow obstruction on renal histology  effects of bladder outflow obstruction on expression of pro-apoptosis gene Bax and anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-X - effects of bladder outflow obstruction on renal regional apoptosis  effects of bladder outflow obstruction on serum fetal ACTH and cortisol levels. Bladder outflow obstruction resulted in sequential morphological change in the fetal kidney over time. By 2 days post-obstruction, cystic change was noted. In addition, patchy attenuation of the nephrogenic blastema was evident by 5 days post-obstruction, with more confluent blastemal attenuation as well as generalized renal architectural disorganization by 10 days post-obstruction. By 20 and 30 days post-obstruction, cystic renal dysplasia had developed. Bladder outflow obstruction resulted in an increase in the ratio of renal expression of pro-apoptosis gene Bax to anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-X. Regional apoptosis counts showed increased tubular apoptosis compared to controls at 2 days post-obstruction, and increased blastemal apoptosis compared to controls at 5 days post-obstruction. By 10 days post-obstruction, blastemal apoptosis counts were reduced compared to controls. There were no significant differences in fetal serum ACTH and cortisol levels between fetal lambs with bladder outflow obstruction and controls. In conclusion, the results of this thesis outline the spectrum of morphological change in the fetal kidney over 30 days of bladder outflow obstruction. They show that detectable changes in morphology occur within two days of bladder outflow obstruction. Likewise, detectable changes in gene expression occur within 2 days of bladder outflow obstruction. The increased ratio of expression of Bax to Bcl-X suggests a swing towards increased apoptosis in response to bladder outflow obstruction. Further research is required to ascertain if these changes are reversible. However, the early onset of these changes as shown in this thesis suggests that any fetal intervention to protect the fetal kidney from the effects of bladder outflow obstruction may need to be instituted very early in gestation</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydronephrosis</field><field name="subject">Fetus -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Fetal hydronephrosis</field><field name="subject">Posterior urethral valves</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0151</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On combination and interference free window spreading sequences</field><field name="creator">Cresp, Gregory</field><field name="description">Spread spectrum techniques have a number of different applications, including range finding, synchronisation, anti-jamming systems and multiple access communication systems. In each of these applications the properties of the resulting systems depend heavily on the family of spreading sequences employed. As such, the design of spreading sequences is an important area of research. Two areas of spreading sequence design are of particular interest in this work, combination techniques and Interference Free Window (IFW) sequences. Combination techniques allow a new sequence family to be constructed by combining two or more existing families. Such an approach allows some of the desirable properties of the components to be maintained, whilst mitigating the components' disadvantages. In addition, it can facilitate the construction of large families at a greatly reduced computational cost. Combination families are considered through the construction of two new classes of sequences, modified Unified Complex Hadamard Transform (UCHT) sequences, and combination Oppermann sequences, respectively based on UCHT sequences and periodic Oppermann sequences. Numerical optimisation techniques are employed to demonstrate the favourable performance of sequences from these classes compared to conventional families. Second, IFW sequences are considered. In systems where approximate, but not perfect, synchronisation between different users can be maintained, IFW sequences can be employed to greatly reduce both interference between users and interference resulting from multipath spread of each user's signal. Large Area Synchronous (LAS) sequences are a class of sequences which both result from combination techniques and exhibit an IFW. LAS sequences are produced by combining Large Area (LA) sequences and LS sequences. They have been demonstrated to be applicable to multiple access communication systems, particularly through their use in LAS2000, which was proposed for third generation mobile telephony. Work to date has been restricted to only a very small range of examples of these families. In order to examine a wider range of LAS sequences, the construction and resulting properties of LA and LS families are considered. The conditions an LA family must satisfy are codified here, and algorithms which can be used to construct LA families with given parameters are presented. The construction of LS sequences is considered, and relationship between each of the parameters used in this construction and the properties of the final family is examined. Using this expanded understanding of both these sequence families, a far wider range of LAS families, potentially applicable to a wider range of applications, can be considered. Initially, the merits of proposed sequences are considered primarily through their correlation properties. Both maximum and mean squared correlation values are considered, depending on the context. In order to demonstrate their practical applicability, combination Oppermann, modified UCHT and LAS sequences are employed in a simulated communications system, and the resulting bit error rates are examined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital communications</field><field name="subject">Spread spectrum communications</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Sequence design</field><field name="subject">Interference free window</field><field name="subject">Spread spectrum communications</field><field name="subject">Combination sequences</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0152</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering solutions to water quality problems in lakes</field><field name="creator">Morillo, Sebastian</field><field name="description">Lake restoration and management strategies focus on reducing the negative impacts of enriched or polluted inflows. These strategies become of paramount importance when lakes are used for recreational and/or drinking water purposes. Long term control of eutrophication and turbidity problems associated with large inflow loads is usually oriented to catchment management. Although it has been suggested that this is the correct long term approach, public concerns usually require a short term solution. In addition, due to political and economic costs related to changes in catchment management, in-lake restoration technologies have been emerging as a viable pretreatment option, complementary to water treatment plants, both reducing the operational costs of the water treatment plant and ameliorating the water residing in the lakes. This research investigates the effects of two in-lake technologies on the dynamics of inflowing rivers, where basin shape plays a significant role. The three lakes in this study suffer from eutrophication combined with a distinctive water quality problem: from turbidity in Silvan Reservoir (Australia), to heavy metal loads in Coeur d'Alene Lake (USA) and industrial wastes in Lake Como (Italy). Firstly, the influence of basin morphology, wind speed, and wind direction on the fate and transport of two rivers flowing into the L-shaped Coeur d'Alene Lake was examined, and it was shown that transport and mixing patterns in a lake can be greatly influenced by the shape of the lake, leading to important consequences for the plankton ecology in the lake. Secondly, in Silvan Reservoir we investigated the potential to modify the basin shape using vertical barriers, increasing the retention time and hence the barrier capacity to microbial pollution. A final in-lake technology was tested for Lake Como, using a downward pointing impeller to remove polluted water from the coastal margin. Lessons from these three examples indicate that there is significant potential for in-lake remediation at relatively low cost, over relatively short timescales.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eutrophication</field><field name="subject">Lake restoration</field><field name="subject">Lakes -- Management</field><field name="subject">Reservoirs -- Management</field><field name="subject">Water quality management</field><field name="subject">Lakes and reservoirs</field><field name="subject">Residence time and flushing</field><field name="subject">Transport of nutrients, heavy metals, and contaminants</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0153</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neurophysiologically mediated auditory processing insensitivity in children with specific language impairment : behavioural discrimination and the mismatch and late discriminative negativities</field><field name="creator">Mengler, Elise Dione</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Some children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) show poor performance on behavioural tasks designed to measure rapid auditory processing, such as the Repetition Test developed by Tallal and colleagues. Stemming from concerns about whether this task reflects higher-order, cognitive variables, this thesis sought to determine whether the performance deficits SLI children show were evident at the neurophysiological level, with minimal cognitive influences, such as attention, using paradigms designed to elicit the mismatch negativity (MMN) and late discriminative negativity (LDN). In the first two studies, a MMN paradigm, equivalent to the Repetition Test, was trialled with a group of 8 adults. In this paired paradigm, the second tone of a pair of pure tones ascending in frequency ('low'-'high') was occasionally replaced with a 'low' tone. The aim was to determine a 'long' and 'short' intra-pair interval (IPI) with which MMN was generated utilizing this paradigm and that were congruent with the Repetition Test findings (i.e., a long IPI at which SLI were able to perform the task, and a short IPI at which SLI children's performance was selectively impaired). In Study One, MMN to a within-pair frequency change was generated with the 30 ms IPI, but not the 700 ms IPI. The grouping parameters of the temporal window of integration (TWI) and temporal distinctiveness were considered less than optimal for the grouping of the pairs presented at 700 ms IPI for the pre-attentive system to register the within-pair frequency change. ... The frequency difference limens (DLs) of the SLI group were significantly higher than a group of 18 normally developing age- and intelligence-matched peers, but there was no significant difference between the groups in their performance on a control intensity discrimination task. The iii SLI group also showed poorer reading skills, yet frequency discrimination was related to oral language ability only. In the final study, MMN was measured to examine the pre-attentive neurophysiological basis of the SLI group's frequency discrimination deficit. Two frequency deviants that were just above each group's 75% DL on the frequency discrimination task were employed in a simple frequency change paradigm: 40 Hz difference for the control group, and 80 Hz difference for the SLI group. MMN and LDN were elicited in the group of 15 normally developing children to their 40 Hz suprathreshold frequency difference and to the 80 Hz difference. A significant MMN was not observed in the group of 13 SLI children to the 40 Hz difference, which was below their threshold level. However, despite discrimination at the behavioural level, MMN did not reach significance in the SLI group to their 80 Hz suprathreshold frequency difference, yet LDN was observed. MMN was larger in both groups for the 80 Hz difference. Furthermore, MMN and LDN amplitude to the suprathreshold deviants were predictive of both frequency and intensity DLs. These results suggested that SLI children have a pre-attentive neurophysiologically mediated insensitivity to small frequency differences, and that MMN (and LDN) to suprathreshold frequency deviants is a sensitive indicator of group discrimination differences and brain-behaviour relationships in children with and without SLI.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language disorders in children -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Cognition in children</field><field name="subject">Specific language impairment</field><field name="subject">Mismatch negativity</field><field name="subject">Late discriminative negativity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0154</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian investor relations practices</field><field name="creator">Spaseska, Aleksandra</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Investor relations (IR) management encompasses a broad range of activities including voluntary disclosure, attracting analyst coverage, targeting investors, and providing feedback to corporate managers (Byrd, Goulet, Johnson and Johnson 1993; Brennan and Tamarowski 2000; Bushee and Miller 2005). In recent years, a number of high profile corporate collapses and concerns about selective disclosure have contributed to an increased awareness of the importance of effective IR practices in promoting investor confidence. To this end, Australian market regulators and industry bodies have developed a number of best practice guidelines relating to disclosure and corporate governance. The current study undertakes a comprehensive investigation of corporate approaches to IR in the Australian context, and seeks to explain cross-sectional variation in these. The sample utilised in this study comprises 129 All Ordinaries Index (AOI) constituent companies that responded to a mail survey conducted in 2006 regarding their IR practices. The survey of all AOI companies constitutes the first Australian academic survey of IR practices, and the views of the individuals responsible for the function. Self-reported data are combined with data collected from the sample entities' websites to provide a detailed overview of corporate IR programs. The results of the survey suggest that there is widespread recognition, within the sample, of the importance of devoting organisational resources to IR. ... Several proxies for the extent of investment in IR are developed in this study. Two proxies capture organisational arrangements for managing IR, one proxy captures the frequency of one-to-one meetings with analysts and investors, and one proxy captures the quality of IR websites. Multivariate analyses relate cross-sectional variation in these to a number of firm-specific variables. Consistent with findings presented in the empirical voluntary disclosure literature, this study shows that the extent of investment in IR is positively associated with firm size, a finding that is common across all IR proxies. Ownership characteristics play an important role in explaining different types of investment in IR, as captured by the four proxies. Ownership concentration is negatively associated with the likelihood of employing an external IR consultant and positively associated with the frequency with which one-to-one meetings are held with analysts and investors. Firms with a foreign stock exchange listing, a proxy for the importance of foreign investors, achieve higher scores for the quality of their IR websites. Adverse selection models of voluntary disclosure predict that firms with good news are likely to disclose more. In contrast, the results of this study show that less profitable firms and firms with lower price-to-book ratios are more likely to have an IR department/officer, and they achieve higher scores for the quality of their IR websites. Finally, the nature of the investment in IR appears to differ with sector membership. Firms in the Materials and Energy sectors held more one-to-one meetings than firms in other sectors, while firms in the Information Technology sector are more likely to have an IR department or IR officer, and have higher quality IR websites than firms in other sectors.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations -- Investor relations -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Investor relations</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0155</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On a posteriori probability decoding of linear block codes over discrete channels</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, Wayne Bradley</field><field name="description">One of the facets of the mobile or wireless environment is that errors quite often occur in bursts. Thus, strong codes are required to provide protection against such errors. This in turn motivates the employment of decoding algorithms which are simple to implement, yet are still able to attempt to take the dependence or memory of the channel model into account in order to give optimal decoding estimates. Furthermore, such algorithms should be able to be applied for a variety of channel models and signalling alphabets. The research presented within this thesis describes a number of algorithms which can be used with linear block codes. Given the received word, these algorithms determine the symbol which was most likely transmitted, on a symbol-by-symbol basis. Due to their relative simplicity, a collection of algorithms for memoryless channels is reported first. This is done to establish the general style and principles of the overall collection. The concept of matrix diagonalisation may or may not be applied, resulting in two different types of procedure. Ultimately, it is shown that the choice between them should be motivated by whether storage space or computational complexity has the higher priority. As with all other procedures explained herein, the derivation is first performed for a binary signalling alphabet and then extended to fields of prime order. These procedures form the paradigm for algorithms used in conjunction with finite state channel models, where errors generally occur in bursts. In such cases, the necessary information is stored in matrices rather than as scalars. Finally, by analogy with the weight polynomials of a code and its dual as characterised by the MacWilliams identities, new procedures are developed for particular types of Gilbert-Elliott channel models. Here, the calculations are derived from three parameters which profile the occurrence of errors in those models. The decoding is then carried out using polynomial evaluation rather than matrix multiplication. Complementing this theory are several examples detailing the steps required to perform the decoding, as well as a collection of simulation results demonstrating the practical value of these algorithms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Error-correcting codes (Information theory)</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">A posteriori probability decoding</field><field name="subject">Non-binary codes</field><field name="subject">Discrete memoryless channel</field><field name="subject">Linear block codes</field><field name="subject">Generalised weight polynomials</field><field name="subject">Gilbert-Elliott channel</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0156</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Executive functioning and the adaptation to novelty</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Jeffrey</field><field name="description">[Truncated thesis] This thesis is concerned with executive functioning in two different but related ways. The first is as an information processing construct in cognitive psychology. There are many different conceptualisations of the information processing basis of executive functioning but this thesis will pursue the notion that executive functioning is best thought of as adaptation to novelty. In the thesis, this will be operationalised using performance indices (principally reaction time) from a number of information processing tasks. These tasks have typically been used in the literature to index either executive functioning or speed of information processing. Both kinds of tasks are used to tackle the second concern of this thesis, namely, how executive functioning is measured. The data analytic techniques developed in this thesis are based on the hypothesis that executive functioning is the process or processes involved in resolving task novelty and consequently measurement will be enhanced through an analysis of performance changes within tasks as the task changes from novel to familiar. The analysis methods will be based largely on the computation of coefficient of variation of reaction time in successive performance windows across the information processing tasks. An elderly sample was chosen for this thesis because of a history of research that has attempted to determine whether cognitive deficits in the elderly are the consequence of the slowing of information processing speed or to impairment in executive functioning. ... The analysis was driven by the hypothesis that a significant shift in the coefficient of variation would mark a transition from novelty to familiarity in task performance and hence from executive to non-executive phases. Three methods were applied to individual performance curves to determine the point at which for each task this transition occurred. Using criterion measures of variability to separate the task data into two stages, analyses showed, contrary to the hypothesis, that later task performance was more highly associated with executive functioning than in initial task performance. The fourth stage of analysis (Chapter 7) applied confirmatory factor analysis to the newly-formed pre- and post transition data. Evidence was found that the magnitude of the contributions of EF across the pre- and post-criterion phases was stable, failing to support the hypothesis. Finally, structural equation modelling was used to examine how age and intelligence in this elderly sample exerts its influence on task performance and whether EF or IPS was the primary cause of age-related cognitive decline. The results showed that the age and intelligence effects on performance were mediated by the requirement to adapt to novelty. Although there was limited evidence to claim that EF is the primary cause of age-related cognitive decline, ageing effects were only apparent when the participants were adapting to novelty. The thesis concludes that there is some support for the hypothesis that executive functioning is best thought of as the processes underpinning adaptation to novelty. While not a panacea, the analytic techniques developed show promise for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognition in old age</field><field name="subject">Cognition -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Human information processing</field><field name="subject">Congnition -- Age factors</field><field name="subject">Executive functioning</field><field name="subject">Cognitive ageing</field><field name="subject">Novelty adaptation</field><field name="subject">Within-task variability</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0157</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Routine and rare genetic connections in corals off northwest Australia and the implications for conservation</field><field name="creator">Underwood, Jim</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The extent to which marine populations are connected by larval dispersal is crucial to their distribution, maintenance and diversity. Thus, for the effective conservation of threatened systems such as coral reefs, understanding patterns of connectivity is essential. However, the biophysical mechanisms that retain or disperse larvae within and among populations are poorly understood. Though the open ocean environment provides the opportunity for long-distance dispersal, if this potential is only rarely realised, recruits produced from afar are unlikely to contribute to the local-scale demography of populations over ecological time frames, but will limit broad-scale genetic diversification over evolutionary time. This thesis explores the extent of genetic and demographic connectivity of two species of reef-building corals over a range of spatial scales among the discontinuous reef systems of northwest Australia. ... Putative source and sink dynamics were not random, but were associated with levels of disturbance and recovery from a recent and catastrophic coral bleaching. When S. hystrix samples from another two offshore systems were included in the analysis, large differences among systems showed that gene flow over hundreds of kilometres is rare over microevolutionary time scales that account for connections over multiple generations. Levels of subdivision over the same spatial scales were markedly lower in the acroporid coral, Acropora tenuis, than in S. hystrix. These results are congruent with expectations based on reproductive mode; in contrast to S. hystrix, which releases brooded larvae that are competent to settle immediately, A. tenuis broadcasts its gametes, and after external fertilisation, the larvae need to develop for several days before they are competent to settle. Despite the differences in levels of broad-scale subdivision, in both species significant differentiation was detected between reefs within systems (&gt;10 km), and between sites within some reefs (&lt; 10 km). These results indicate not only that dispersal between reefs and even some reef patches is restricted, but also that hydrodynamics influence retention of brooded and spawned larvae in similar ways. Further analysis of A. tenuis populations from two coastal systems detected significant differences in genetic diversity among the four major systems of northwest Australia. Additionally, genetic divergence between the coastal and offshore zones was greater than expected by the geographic separation of systems, indicating that connectivity between these zones via transport of A. tenuis larvae on oceanic currents occurs rarely even over microevolutionary time scales. This study has two primary implications for conservation. First, since coastal and offshore reefs of northwest Australia appear to be discrete genetic entities, they have independent evolutionary potential to adapt to local conditions and environmental change. Second, systems, reefs and some reef patches of northwest Australia are demographically independent units. Therefore, designs of coral reserve networks should consider routine dispersal distances of kilometres to a few tens of kilometres.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corals -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Corals -- Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Coral reef management</field><field name="subject">Seriatopora hystrix</field><field name="subject">Acropora tenuis</field><field name="subject">Larvae -- Dispersal</field><field name="subject">Connectivity</field><field name="subject">Marine protected areas</field><field name="subject">Disturbance</field><field name="subject">Recruitment</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0158</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antimicrobial plants of Australia have the potential to prevent lactic acidosis in ruminants</field><field name="creator">Hutton, Peter</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Antimicrobial growth promoters are added to feed to prevent lactic acidosis in ruminant animals by selectively inhibiting rumen bacteria that produce lactic acid. However, recently imposed or impending bans on the use of antimicrobial growth promoters in animal production have lead to a critical need to find practical alternatives that are safe for the animal and consumer and that obtain similar production benefits. I investigated bioactive plants of Australia for their potential to prevent lactic acidosis in ruminants. The unifying hypothesis tested was that plants would be identified that selectively inhibit lactic acid-producing bacteria and consequently protect against lactic acidosis. This hypothesis was tested in a three phase process: phase 1, plant selection and collection; phase 2, a three stage protocol for screening plants and essential oils; phase 3, in vivo experiments and chemical fractionation of the most promising plant. I developed an in vitro bioassay that simulated acidosis by adding glucose to rumen fluid in Bellco tubes and incubating for 5 h (Chapter 4). The pH and gas production were used as indicators of acidosis and fermentation activity. I used this bioassay to screen ninety-five plants (dried and ground material from 79 species) and ten essential oils and included a negative control (oaten chaff) and a positive control (virginiamycin). One plant, Eremophila glabra, produced a similar pH (5.63) to the positive control (5.43) although it inhibited gas production to a moderate extent (P &lt; 0.05). ... Seven serrulatane diterpenes were identified to be the major secondary metabolites in E. glabra. The metabolites were screened using a broth dilution and microtitre spectrophotometry method and were selective against S. bovis at between 320 and 1077 [mu]g/ mL. The serrulatanes from E. glabra were probably responsible for the activity against acidosis that I observed in vitro, because they selectively inhibited lactateproducing bacteria. It is also possible that a synergy between serrulatanes and possibly other metabolites are responsible for the activity observed in vitro. The results from my experiments support the role that bioactive plants may have to replace the antibiotics that are added to livestock feed. Australian plants were identified containing compounds that were active against the bacterial processes responsible for ruminant acidosis. To my knowledge this is the first work undertaken to identify bioactive plants of Australia for their potential to prevent acidosis. I developed in vitro screening bioassays that targeted key indicators of acidosis. These bioassays enabled me to identify 5 plants from the 104 screened that could potentially control acidosis. One of these plants in particular, E. glabra, showed a level of activity in vitro that was comparable to antibiotic protection against acidosis. The exciting in vitro results were not demonstrated in vivo but only one dose level of E. glabra was used, which was based on the in vitro work. In contrast to the in vitro system the rumen is a continuous flow system with greater complexity and it is possible that the concentration of E. glabra that I used in vivo was not optimum. This places importance on future dose response experiments to confirm the efficacy of E. glabra in vivo.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acidosis</field><field name="subject">Ruminants -- Feeding and feeds</field><field name="subject">Anti-infective agents</field><field name="subject">Plant bioactive compounds</field><field name="subject">Eremophilia glabra</field><field name="subject">Lactic acid -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Lactic acid -- Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Rumen fermentation</field><field name="subject">Lactic acidosis in ruminants</field><field name="subject">Rumen microbiology</field><field name="subject">Australian bioactive plants</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0159</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple-imputation approaches to haplotypic analysis of population-based data with applications to cardiovascular disease</field><field name="creator">McCaskie, Pamela Ann</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis investigates novel methods for the genetic association analysis of haplotype data in samples of unrelated individuals, and applies these methods to the analysis of coronary heart disease and related phenotypes. Determining the inheritance pattern of genetic variants in studies of unrelated individuals can be problematic because family members of the studied individuals are often not available. For the analysis of individual genetic loci, no problem arises because the unit of interest is the observed genotype. When the unit of interest is the linear combination of alleles along one chromosome, inherited together in a haplotype, it is not always possible to determine with certainty the inheritance pattern, and therefore statistical methods to infer these patterns must be adopted. Due to genotypic heterozygosity, mutliple possible haplotype configurations can often resolve an individual's genotype measures at multiple loci. When haplotypes are not known, but are inferred statistically, an element of uncertainty is thus inherent which, if not dealt with appropriately, can result in unreliable estimates of effect sizes in an association setting. The core aim of the research described in this thesis was to develop and implement a general method for haplotype-based association analysis using multiple imputation to appropriately deal with uncertainty haplotype assignment. Regression-based approaches to association analysis provide flexible methods to investigate the influence of a covariate on a response variable, adjusting for the effects of other variables including interaction terms. ... These methods are then applied to models accommodating binary, quantitative, longitudinal and survival data. The performance of the multiple imputation method implemented was assessed using simulated data under a range of haplotypic effect sizes and genetic inheritance patterns. The multiple imputation approach performed better, on average, than ignoring haplotypic uncertainty, and provided estimates that in most cases were similar to those observed when haplotypes were known. The haplotype association methods developed in this thesis were used to investigate the genetic epidemiology of cardiovascular disease, utilising data for the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene (CETP), the hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene and the 15- lipoxygenase (ALOX15) gene on a total of 6,487 individuals from three Western Australian studies. Results of these analyses suggested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the CETP gene were associated with increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). SNPs in the LIPC gene were also associated with increased HDL-C and haplotypes in the ALOX15 gene were associated with risk of carotid plaque among individuals with premature CHD. The research presented in this thesis is both novel and important as it provides methods for the analysis of haplotypic associations with a range of response types, while incorporating information about haplotype uncertainty inherent in populationbased studies. These methods are shown to perform well for a range of simulated and real data situations, and have been written into a statistical analysis package that has been freely released to the research community.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Diseases -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Genetic epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Genetics -- Statistical methods</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Diseases -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Haplotypes</field><field name="subject">Statistical genetics</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0160</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What money can't buy : the status of financial evaluation</field><field name="creator">Baker, Ian</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Money -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Friendship</field><field name="subject">Comparison (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Money value</field><field name="subject">Incommensurability</field><field name="subject">Justice</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0161</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolutionary implications of polyandry in house mice (Mus domesticus)</field><field name="creator">Firman, Renee C.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Despite the costs associated with mating, females of many taxa solicit multiple mates during a single reproductive event (polyandry). Polyandry is clearly adaptive when females gain direct benefits from males at mating. However, polyandry has also been shown to increase female fitness in the absence of direct benefits. Thus, a number of genetic benefit hypotheses have been developed to account for the origin of this behaviour. Although not mutually exclusive, a distinction lays between genetic benefits that propose defense against reproductive failure (nonadditive genetic effects), and those that propose benefits from intrinsic sire effects (additive genetic effects). Nonadditive genetic benefits of polyandry have been documented in a number of species; by soliciting multiple mates females can avoid inbreeding and other forms of incompatibility between parental genotypes. Polyandry may also increase female reproductive success when genetically superior males have greater success in sperm competition, and produce better quality offspring. An inevitable consequence of polyandry is that sperm from rival males will overlap in the female reproductive tract and compete to fertilise the ova. The outcome of sperm competition is typically determined by bias in sperm use by the females, interactions between parental genotypes, and ejaculate characteristics that provide a fertilisation advantage. Thus, sperm competition is recognised as a persuasive force in the evolution of male reproductive traits. Comparative analyses across species, and competitive mating trials within species have suggested that sperm competition can influence the evolution of testis size and sperm production, and both sperm form and sperm function. ... After six generations of selection I observed phenotypic divergence in litter size - litter size increased in the polyandrous lines but not in the monandrous lines. This result was not attributable to inbreeding depression, or environmental/maternal effects associated with mating regime. Genetic benefits associated with polyandry could account for this result if increased litter size were attributable to increased embryo survival. However, males from the polyandrous lineages were subject to sperm competition, and evolved ejaculates with more sperm, suggesting that evolutionary increases in litter size may in part be due to improved male fertility. Finally, Chapter Five is an investigation of the natural variation in levels of polyandry in the wild, and the potential for sperm competition to drive macroevolutionary changes in male reproductive traits among geographically isolated island populations of house mice. I sampled seven island populations of house mice along the coast of Western Australia and, by genotyping pregnant females and their offspring, determined the frequency of multiply sired litters within each population. I applied the frequency of multiple paternity as an index of the risk of sperm competition, and looked for selective responses in testis size and ejaculate traits. I found that the risk of sperm competition predicted testis size across the seven island populations. However, variation in sperm traits was not explained by the risk of sperm competition. I discuss these results in relation to sperm competition theory, and extrinsic factors that influence ejaculate quality.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polyandry</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Mus domesticus</field><field name="subject">Sperm competition</field><field name="subject">Evolution (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Natural selection</field><field name="subject">Sexual selection in animals</field><field name="subject">Polyandry</field><field name="subject">Postcopulatory sexual selection</field><field name="subject">Mammals</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0162</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children at educational risk : the development and validation of an instrument for early identification</field><field name="creator">Glasgow, Kenneth</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The overall aim of the research reported in this thesis was to develop and validate an instrument that would identify young children at educational risk. To achieve this, four separate but interrelated studies were conducted. Study One sought to explore the construct of young children at educational risk from the perspective of school psychologists and teachers through a series of open ended interviews. To this end, four school psychologists in charge of centres for severely disruptive children, and seven psychologists and three teachers involved in alternative education programs for alienated youth were interviewed. The findings of Study One revealed a broad range of factors and issues that contribute to a child being placed at educational risk. Interviewees specifically highlighted the significance of behavioural, learning, social, psychological and family factors which contributed to children's at educational risk status. The findings of Study One were incorporated into Study Two, the overall aim of which was to develop and validate a new instrument for the early identification of children at educational risk. Initially, 152 items were generated from the literature critically reviewed in Chapter Two, existing instrumentation and the Study One interview findings. ... In Study Four the construct validity of the CaERI was investigated by examining whether scores on the instrument differentiated between at educational risk groups of children and a group of not at educational risk children. The total data were first investigated for normality of distribution and returned a Shapiro-Wilk statistic of .99 and a significance level of .069 indicating that the combined data set were normally distributed. The individual CaERI scores for the three individual domains were then investigated and Shapiro-Wilk scores ranging from .96 to .99 and significance levels of .13 to .84, supported the assumption that the data are normally distributed. Significant between groups differences were found on the Behaviour Domain, where LDC children scored significantly lower than the regular class at educational risk and SPER-C children. The regular class at educational risk children also scored significantly lower than the SPER-C children which suggest that in the Behaviour Domain the instrument is sensitive enough to differentiate between the three groups. Significant between group differences were also evident between the LDC and regular class at educational risk and the SPER-C groups, with the LDC children scoring lower than the other two groups in the Social and Psychological Domains. Although the SPER-C group children scored higher than the regular class at educational risk group the difference was not significant. Similarly, a gender comparison of the at educational risk groups showed significant differences between males and females on the Behaviour Domain, however, the differences were not significant on the Social or Psychological Domains. A comparison of 20 not at educational risk students with a matched sample of 20 regular class at educational risk students found significant differences between the v groups on all domains.

In geophysics, ultrasound or electromagnetic waves are normally used to provide the tomographic information. In the geotechnical area, seismic tomography is emerging as a promising technique that can be used to determine the spatial variability of shear wave velocities and hence the small strain stiffness of geomaterials. Although some studies have been undertaken to incorporate seismic measurement into centrifuge modelling, there has been to date no attempt to build a complete seismic tomography facility with high resolution for use in a geotechnical centrifuge. Such a powerful facility can help in better understanding of soil behaviour by providing a complete picture of the spatial variation of the soil property of concern. The main aim of this study was to develop a high-resolution seismic tomography (ST) system for the beam centrifuge at the University of Western Australia (UWA) by which the shear wave velocity and hence maximum shear modulus could be determined anywhere in the centrifuge model. ... This limitation was the requirement to use an a priori model. The exact solutions in the different examples presented in this chapter were known, and they were used as a priori models into the inversion process. However, in practice the exact solution is unknown, and the aim of the tomographic inversion is to obtain a solution that best describes the measured data. Carrying out inversion without using an a priori model can yield an output model that hints at the nature of the model. This output can then be used as the starting point in an iterative process, in which the output from one step is used as an a priori model for reinverting the original data in a subsequent step. In this case, this process slightly improved the output tomogram and decreased the value of root mean squares of travel time residuals (Rrms). An alternative inversion strategy was proposed based on the results obtained in this study. It involves using a searching algorithm. A searching process can be carried out based on the output from the first iteration (without using an a priori model). The search can involve varying the parameters that describe buried anomalies, such as the size of the anomaly, the velocity value in the anomaly, and the location of the anomaly. The aim is to search for the combination of anomaly parameters that minimises the resulting error parameters (mainly Rrmx, but also the average error and the standard deviation of the error). For more subtle cases, such as the velocity model under a footing, where inversion without using an a priori model did not recover the input model, a searching algorithm involving applying perturbations to the exact Boussinesq model can be performed. Not only can the searching procedure involve adding perturbation to the velocity values in the Boussinesq model, but it can also add perturbation to the shape of the velocity distribution below the footing. The searching process can continue until a model that fits the data with a minimum error is found, i.e., minimising Rrms.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seismic tomography</field><field name="subject">Geotechnical centrifuge</field><field name="subject">Bender element</field><field name="subject">Shear wave velocity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0165</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibition, anxiety and the development of auditory hallucinations</field><field name="creator">Paulik, Georgina</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Auditory hallucinations (AHs) are one of the most common symptoms of schizophrenia, and are associated with high levels of distress, functional impairment, and need for care. However, current understanding of the exact causes  and thus treatment  of AHs is still in its infancy. Recently, Badcock and colleagues proposed a cognitive dual-deficit model of AHs, which stipulates that intentional inhibition deficits underlie the intrusive and unintentional nature of AHs, while context memory binding deficits explain the source misattribution (Waters, Badcock, Michie, &amp; Maybery, 2006). While this model seems to best explain the different features of AHs, the precise components of inhibitory control involved, and the evident role of negative affect in the production of AHs, have not been empirically examined. Thus, the first two aims of this thesis were to clarify the critical component(s) of inhibitory control specifically related to AHs, and to examine the relationships between negative affect (chiefly anxiety), AHs and inhibitory control. Finally, AHs are also commonly reported by individuals in the general population, consistent with a continuum approach to AHs. Accordingly, the third aim of this thesis was to investigate whether similar relationships exist between hallucinatory-type experiences, inhibitory processes and negative affect in both hallucination predisposition and schizophrenia. The first study presents the findings from two related investigations of hallucination predisposition. ... However, the study revealed a significant relationship between intentional inhibition and trait anxiety (which was independent of hallucination predisposition) allowing the possibility that more severe or longer lasting changes in anxiety may indeed exacerbate difficulties with intentional inhibition. The final study sought to determine whether the pattern of relationships between AHs, inhibitory impairments and anxiety in schizophrenia are similar to those found in hallucination predisposition. The same three cognitive tasks previously employed (ICIM, B-P, and DI) were administered to schizophrenia (N = 61) and healthy control (N = 34) participants. Schizophrenia participants overall exhibited difficulties intentionally resisting interference from distracting stimuli, however did not have difficulties [intentionally or unintentionally] inhibiting task-irrelevant memory traces. Consistent with the continuum approach, AHs were related only to difficulties with intentional inhibition, and these difficulties existed independently from anxiety (although anxiety was related to intentional inhibition) and were unrelated to other schizophrenia symptoms. Together, the studies support the first component of Badcock et al.'s dual-deficit model of AHs, with hallucinatory experiences in both hallucination predisposition and schizophrenia associated with specific intentional inhibition impairments. The findings also suggest that while anxiety may contribute to the production of AHs by exacerbating v existing intentional inhibition impairments, it is likely that anxiety has additional routes of influence. These findings provide strong support for the continuum approach to AHs. The implications of these findings and possible avenues for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schizofrenia</field><field name="subject">Hallucination predisposition</field><field name="subject">Affect</field><field name="subject">Auditory hallucinations</field><field name="subject">Inhibition</field><field name="subject">Anxiety</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0166</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA marker assisted breeding in interspecific crosses to improve canola (Brassica napus L.)</field><field name="creator">Schelfhout, Christopher James</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In order to expand the gene pool of canola-quality rapeseed (Brassica napus) reciprocal interspecific crosses were made between B. napus cv. Mystic and near canola-quality B. juncea breeding line JN29. F1 progeny from these crosses were used to make backcrosses to both parents in all possible combinations and directions, and were selfed to form F2-derived lines. The highest frequencies of viable F2 and BC1 progeny were obtained when B. napus was the maternal parent of the interspecific hybrid. BC1 and F2 progeny (and subsequent generations) were grown under field conditions to identify agronomic improvements over the parents. Transgressive segregation was observed in F2 and BC1 and in subsequent generations for agronomic traits (seed yield under high or low rainfall conditions, plant biomass, harvest index, height, branching and days to anthesis) and seed quality traits (oil, protein, glucosinolates, oleic acid). The majority of progeny conformed to B. napus morphology, and a minority segregated to B. juncea morphology in subsequent generations. Some of the B. juncea morphotypes had lower glucosinolates and higher oleic acid than the parent JN29, with no detectable erucic acid, and thereby conformed to canola quality. Methods were developed for tracing B-genome in interspecific progeny. A repetitive DNA sequence pBNBH35 from B. nigra (genome BB, 2n = 16) was used to identify B-genome chromosomes and introgressions in interspecific progeny. Specific primers were designed for pBNBH35 in order to amplify the repetitive sequence by PCR. A cloned sub-fragment of 329 bp was confirmed by sequencing as part of pBNBH35. PCR and hybridisation techniques were used on an array of Brassica species to confirm that the pBNBH35 subfragment was Brassica B-genome specific. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in B nigra, B. juncea (AABB, 2n=36) and B. napus (AACC, 2n=38) showed that the pBNBH35 sub-fragment was present on all eight Brassica Bgenome chromosomes and absent from A- and C-genome chromosomes. The pBNBH35 repeat was localised to the centromeric region of each B-genome chromosome. FISH clearly distinguished the B-genome chromosomes from the A-genome chromosomes in the amphidiploid species B. juncea. This is the first known report of a B-genome repetitive marker that is present on all Brassica Bgenome chromosomes. ... The results suggest that novel B. napus genotypes have been generated containing introgressions of B-genome chromatin from B. juncea chromosomes. B. juncea morphology occurred in interspecific progeny with a chromosome complement similar to B. napus (2n = 38) and without the entire Bgenome present. It also is highly likely that recombination has occurred between the A-genome of the two Brassica species. This research has demonstrated that the secondary gene pool of B. napus may be accessed by selfing interspecific hybrids, and without sacrificing canola quality, if the B. juncea parent is near canola-quality. Interspecific progeny may be screened to enhance the proportion with B-genome positive signals. Some progeny with B. junceatype morphology had improved seed quality over the JN29 parent.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brassica -- Breeding</field><field name="subject">Crop improvement</field><field name="subject">Rape (Plant)</field><field name="subject">Rape (Plant) -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Wide hybridisation</field><field name="subject">Brassica juncea</field><field name="subject">Oilseed rape</field><field name="subject">Indian mustard</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0167</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust speech features for speech recognition in hostile environments</field><field name="creator">Toh, Aik</field><field name="description">Speech recognition systems have improved in robustness in recent years with respect to both speaker and acoustical variability. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to deploy speech recognition systems in real-world applications that are exposed to diverse and significant level of noise. Robustness and recognition accuracy are the essential criteria in determining the extent of a speech recognition system deployed in real-world applications. This work involves development of techniques and extensions to extract robust features from speech and achieve substantial performance in speech recognition. Robustness and recognition accuracy are the top concern in this research. In this work, the robustness issue is approached using the front-end processing, in particular robust feature extraction. The author proposes an unified framework for robust feature and presents a comprehensive evaluation on robustness in speech features. The framework addresses three distinct approaches: robust feature extraction, temporal information inclusion and normalization strategies. The author discusses the issue of robust feature selection primarily in the spectral and cepstral context. Several enhancement and extensions are explored for the purpose of robustness. This includes a computationally efficient approach proposed for moment normalization. In addition, a simple back-end approach is incorporated to improve recognition performance in reverberant environments. Speech features in this work are evaluated in three distinct environments that occur in real-world scenarios. The thesis also discusses the effect of noise on speech features and their parameters. The author has established that statistical properties play an important role in mismatches. The significance of the research is strengthened by the evaluation of robust approaches in more than one scenario and the comparison with the performance of the state-of-the-art features. The contributions and limitations of each robust feature in all three different environments are highlighted. The novelty of the work lies in the diverse hostile environments which speech features are evaluated for robustness. The author has obtained recognition accuracy of more than 98.5% for channel distortion. Recognition accuracy greater than 90.0% has also been maintained for reverberation time 0.4s and additive babble noise at SNR 10dB. The thesis delivers a comprehensive research on robust speech features for speech recognition in hostile environments supported by significant experimental results. Several observations, recommendations and relevant issues associated with robust speech features are presented.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robust speech features</field><field name="subject">Speech recognition</field><field name="subject">Noisy environments</field><field name="subject">Speech processing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0168</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformative mappings : testing a methodology for making site-specific architecture in remote biodiverse landscapes</field><field name="creator">Weir, Ian James</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Remote biodiverse sites present unique problems to architects who seek to create greater connectivity between people and landscape. Such sites, particularly those along Australia's temperate coastlines, are rapidly being developed for housing yet in many cases these landscapes have no prior history of sedentary habitation. Not only do these sites lack relevant architectural precedents, they are yet to be measured and represented; the very acts that define the specifics of site and identity of place. These landscapes are as unrecorded as they are uninhabited and consequently there is little to resist the imposition of foreign architectural typologies - buildings which are inherently ecologically unsustainable and non site-specific. This thesis addressed these problems by testing an architectural design methodology which placed considerable emphasis on site measure and mapping. The key hypothesis that underpinned the research was that site-specific architecture cannot be realised independently of site-specific mapping. The research was conducted from the standpoint that maps are not simply abstracted 'grounds' upon which architectural designs are formulated, they are landscape representations and as such they engage with a broader cultural context by articulating our fundamental concepts of 'landscape'. The thesis is part theoretical discourse and part creative research. The research method involved first selecting a number of study sites in a new housing subdivision located within one of the world's most biodiverse regions. ... Several opportunities arose as a direct result of this publicly engaged process, most notably two professional commissions: the first as guest artist for a two-year state-wide exhibition; the second for a built work of architecture in the study area. Both projects provided a 'proof of concept' test of the applicability of the research method to architectural praxis. While the research primarily addresses the discipline of architectural design, it draws upon methods and approaches from landscape architecture, surveying, botany, photography, and art practice. These disciplines all face the same challenge as architecture in remote biodiverse sites: conventional forms of measure, representation and making must be reconceptualised in order to develop responses which are commensurate with the unique biophysical and cultural conditions which characterise these sites. Because biodiverse sites continuously change, as does our understanding of them, a direct causal link between site-specific mapping and site-specific architecture cannot be established. However, the research has shown that collectively such works provide a 'landscape of resistance': through a highly site-attuned multidisciplinary approach, greater connectivity is achieved between people and landscape and the manifestations of this connectivity - the sitespecific maps and buildings - help to form specifically local understandings of landscape. Building in remote biodiverse landscapes is a technical problem, a creative problem, a cultural problem and an ethical problem. The research presents a means of reconciling these problems in the midst of the present milieu, one which is characterised by extreme technical capacity and environmental anxiety.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Landscape</field><field name="subject">Representation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0171</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanics of mine backfill</field><field name="creator">Helinski, Mathew</field><field name="description">#DEFAULT</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mine backfill</field><field name="subject">Cementation</field><field name="subject">Consolidation</field><field name="subject">Self desiccation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0172</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between dog ownership and physical activity</field><field name="creator">Christian, Hayley Emma</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The Dogs and Physical Activity (DAPA) study sought to examine the relationship between dog ownership and physical activity, in particular walking. It used an ecological model to examine the socio-demographic, intrapersonal, social environmental, physical environmental and policy-related factors affecting dog owners walking with their dog. Results from this study are presented as a series of papers four which are published, in press or accepted for publication. A review of the dog ownership, health and physical activity literature and results from qualitative research of the potential barriers and motivators to dog owners being physically active with their dogs were used to develop and test an instrument for measuring dog walking behaviour. The DAPA tool was designed to measure the amount of physical activity people undertake with their dog and dog-specific individual and environmental factors affecting people walking with their dog. It was developed as a supplementary tool for the second RESIDential Environments (RESIDE) survey. RESIDE is a 5-year longitudinal study of the physical activity levels of people building homes in new housing estates in Western Australia. Findings from the baseline survey of 1813 RESIDE participants (44% dog owners) showed that dog owners were 60% more likely than non-owners to achieve sufficient physical activity and sufficient walking and almost 80% more likely than non-owners to achieve sufficient walking for recreation in the neighbourhood after controlling for demographic, intrapersonal and environmental differences. ... Findings from the DAPA study highlight the importance of the local policy and physical environment in encouraging dog walking behaviour. Perceived lack of accessible public open space (POS) and dogspecific exercise areas were identified by focus group participants as major barriers to dog owners walking with their dog. Objective measurement of the local physical environment of dog owners supported their concerns; no dog owners in this study had access to a sign-posted off-leash park [greater than or equal to] 2 acres within their neighbourhood. Furthermore, access to local POS with dog-supportive infrastructure was associated with being a regular dog walker. Overall, the results of this study draw attention to the needs of dog owners in the allocation and design of POS. The prospective component of the DAPA study enabled examination of the causal relationship between dog ownership and physical activity. After adjusting for baseline variables, dog acquisition significantly increased minutes of recreational walking within the neighbourhood by 37 minutes. However, after further adjustment for changes in baseline variables, the increase in minutes of recreational walking within the neighbourhood from dog acquisition reduced to 21 minutes and was no longer statistically significant. Increase in intention to walk appeared to mediate the relationship between dog acquisition and increased recreational walking. This study highlights a number of important physical activity benefits associated with dog ownership and provides evidence to suggest that dog walking has the potential to positively affect the proportion of the community who are sufficiently active.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Dog owners</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Dog ownership</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0175</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gully erosion on rehabilitated bauxite mines</field><field name="creator">Mengler, Faron</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Landforms rehabilitated after bauxite mining can be vulnerable to soil loss by water erosion processes. On most rehabilitated sites, management controls such as deep ripping, contour mounding and landscaped sub-catchments limit erosion. Despite these measures, severe gully erosion that is anecdotally associated with steep slopes can damage rehabilitated areas and affect downstream drinking water resources. A review of erosion dynamics reveals that gullies develop episodically and in a non-linear manner. They often initiated as a near surface process and are influenced by natural climatic drivers. Despite this, local site characteristics including soil and landform can predispose an area to gully erosion. Moreover, erosion models, becoming more-widely utilized within the mining industry, may provide useful tools with which to measure, analyse, and manage gully erosion. One of these models, SIBERIA was tested to determine its suitability for application a tool to help manage erosion risk. We first surveyed 26 eroding and erosion-prone rehabilitated hillslopes to determine the common form and setting for gully erosion on these rehabilitated bauxite mines. A conceptual model was developed to include and explore the interplay between the common causes of the gullies surveyed. The conceptual model accounts for slope steepness but suggests that additionally, certain triggers and threshold effects operating under different site conditions are as influential (or even more influential) than slope steepness as determinants of gully erosion occurrence and severity. ... Soil properties and soil erodibility had some subtle influence on landform stability and erosion risk. The most-erodible media occurred where either: mine floor material was mixed with topsoil/ overburden; and/or the topsoil/overburden layer was thin or its coverage is patchy resulting in slaking subsoil, hardsetting soil and surface crusts. When erodible surface media were combined with steeper (&gt;8[degrees]) or longer (&gt;50 m) slopes or with any major erosion trigger, rill and gully development was greatly intensified. The SIBERIA simulation model was calibrated and its simulated outputs were compared to known locations of gully erosion on a steep, rehabilitated pit from the Willowdale mine. At a resolution of one metre, SIBERIA was able to simulate the approximate dimensions of gullies. However, SIBERIA could not simulate the exact location of individual gully headcuts. Additionally, SIBERA was able to simulate the effect of different microtopographic surface treatments but this was only achieved by increasing the grid resolution to 25 cm and reducing the size of the area simulated due to model constraints. Locations of gully headcuts were overlain onto a grid-based, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using a Geographic Information System (GIS). The spatial distribution of gully headcut locations was compared to DEM derivatives such as slope and flow accumulation. Positive, and predictive relationships allow between the steepness of the slope of the pre-mining landform and the cell count of the area contributing to flow (catchment), as determined by GIS, may allow a mine scale indication of erosion risk using simple GIS desktop analysis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil erosion -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Aluminum mines and mining</field><field name="subject">Abandoned mined lands reclamation -- Western Australia -- Darling Range</field><field name="subject">Landscape</field><field name="subject">Bauxite mine</field><field name="subject">Erosion mapping</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0176</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origin-centric techniques for optimising scalability and the fidelity of motion, interaction and rendering</field><field name="creator">Thorne, Chris</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This research addresses endemic problems in the fields of computer graphics and simulation such as jittery motion, spatial scalability, rendering problems such as z-buffer tearing, the repeatability of physics dynamics and numerical error in positional systems. Designers of simulation and computer graphics software tend to map real world navigation rules onto the virtual world, expecting to see equivalent virtual behaviour. After all, if computers are programmed to simulate the real world, it is reasonable to expect the virtual behaviour to correspond. However, in computer simulation many behaviours and other computations show measurable problems inconsistent with realworld experience, particularly at large distances from the virtual world origin. Many of these problems, particularly in rendering, can be imperceptible, so users may be oblivious to them, but they are measurable using experimental methods. These effects, generically termed spatial jitter in this thesis, are found in this study to stem from floating point error in positional parameters such as spatial coordinates. This simulation error increases with distance from the coordinate origin and as the simulation progresses through the pipeline. The most common form of simulation error relevant to this study is spatial error which is found by this thesis to not be calculated, as may be expected, using numerical relative error propagation rules but using the rules of geometry. ... The thesis shows that the thinking behind real-world rules, such as for navigation, has to change in order to properly design for optimal fidelity simulation. Origincentric techniques, formulae, terms, architecture and processes are all presented as one holistic solution in the form of an optimised simulation pipeline. The results of analysis, experiments and case studies are used to derive a formula for relative spatial error that accounts for potential pathological cases. A formula for spatial error propagation is then derived by using the new knowledge of spatial error to extend numerical relative error propagation mathematics. Finally, analytical results are developed to provide a general mathematical expression for maximum simulation error and how it varies with distance from the origin and the number of mathematical operations performed. We conclude that the origin centric approach provides a general and optimal solution to spatial jitter. Along with changing the way one thinks about navigation, process guidelines and formulae developed in the study, the approach provides a new paradigm for positional computing. This paradigm can improve many aspects of computer simulation in areas such as entertainment, visualisation for education, industry, science, or training. Examples are: spatial scalability, the accuracy of motion, interaction and rendering; and the consistency and predictability of numerical computation in physics. This research also affords potential cost benefits through simplification of software design and code. These cost benefits come from some core techniques for minimising position dependent error, error propagation and also the simplifications and from new algorithms that flow naturally out of the core solution.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Floating point</field><field name="subject">Precision</field><field name="subject">Spatial jitter</field><field name="subject">Rendering</field><field name="subject">3D graphics</field><field name="subject">Computation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0177</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Curriculum contestation : analysis of contemporary curriculum policy and practices in government and non-government education sectors in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, Joanne</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The aim of this study was to analyse the changing dynamics within and between government and non-government education sectors in relation to the Curriculum Framework (CF) policy in Western Australia (WA) from 1995 to 2004. The Curriculum Council was established by an act of State Parliament in 1997 to oversee the development and enactment of the CF, which was released in 1998. A stated aim of the CF policy was to unify the education sectors through a shared curriculum. The WA State government mandated that all schools, both government and non-government, demonstrate compliance by 2004. This was the first time that curriculum was mandated for non-government schools, therefore the dynamics within and between the education sectors were in an accelerated state of transformation in the period of study. The timeframe for the research represented the period from policy inception (1995) to the deadline for policy enactment for Kindergarten to Year 10 (2004). However, given the continually evolving and increasingly politicised nature of curriculum policy processes in WA, this thesis also provides an extended analysis of policy changes to the time of thesis submission in 2007 when the abolition of the Curriculum Council was formally announced - a decade after it was established. ... The research reported in this thesis draws on both critical theory and post-structuralist approaches to policy analysis within a broader framework of policy network theory. Policy network theory is used to bring the macro focus of critical theory and the micro focus of post-structuralism together in order to highlight power issues at all levels of the policy trajectory. Power dynamics within a policy network are fluid and multidimensional, and power struggles are characteristic at all levels. This study revealed significant power differentials between government and non-government education sectors caused by structural and cultural differences. Differences in autonomy between the education sectors meant that those policy actors within the non-government sector were more empowered to navigate the competing and conflicting forms of accountabilities that emerged from the changes to WA curriculum policy. Despite both generalised discourses of blurring public/private boundaries within the context of neoliberal globalisation and specific CF goals of bringing the sectors together, the boundaries continue to exist. Further, there is much strategising about how to remain distinct within the context of increased market choice. This study makes a unique and significant contribution to the understanding of policy processes surrounding the development and enactment of the CF in WA and the implications for the changing dynamics within and between the education sectors. Emergent themes and findings may potentially be used as a basis for contrast and comparison in other contexts. The research contributes to policy theory by arguing for closer attention to be paid to power dynamics between localised agency in particular policy spaces and the state-imposed constraints.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Competency based education -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Education and state -- Australia -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Curriculum framework</field><field name="subject">Outcomes based education</field><field name="subject">Public and private schooling</field><field name="subject">Policy sociology</field><field name="subject">Market choice</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0178</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complementary investigations of the molecular biology of cancer : assessment of the role of Grb7 in the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells; and prediction and validation of microRNA targets involved in cancer</field><field name="creator">Webster, Rebecca</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] For this thesis, the molecular biology of cancer was approached from two directions. Firstly, an investigation was conducted on the role of growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (Grb7) in breast cancer. Grb7 is an adapter molecule that binds to a variety of proteins, including the growth factor receptor and proto-oncogene, ErbB2, and mediates signalling to downstream pathways. It has been linked to cell migration and an invasive phenotype, and is of interest as a therapeutic target. To investigate the role of Grb7 in breast cancer, preliminary experiments were performed that, firstly, determined the expression of wild-type Grb7 and a splice variant, Grb7V, in a range of cell lines, and secondly, aided the development of a protocol for treating cells with short interfering RNA (siRNA) against Grb7 and the ErbB ligand, heregulin (HRG), in a cell system appropriate for measuring the functional outcomes. Using this protocol in conjunction with CellTitre (CT) proliferation assays, it was demonstrated that Grb7 does not play a role in the proliferation of either unstimulated or HRG-stimulated SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, using the protocol in conjunction with Boyden chamber migration assays, it was shown that inhibition of Grb7 expression has a slight stimulatory effect on HRG-stimulated SK-BR-3 cell migration. Thus, Grb7 was found to play only a minor role in the migration of SK-BR-3 cells, suggesting that it is not an ideal anti-cancer target for breast cancers modelled by this cell system. Concurrently, a second investigation was conducted, which similarly sought insight into the molecular biology of cancer, but adopted a more strategic approach. ... These results provide evidence for a biologically significant role for the miR-7-mediated regulation of EGFR expression. A microarray experiment was also performed to identify genes that were down-regulated following treatment with miR-7 compared to NS precursor. Of 248 down-regulated genes, including EGFR, 37 promising new miR-7 target candidates were identified. Functional clustering of down-regulated genes and promising target candidates suggested that miR-7 may have functionally-related targets involved in processes including cell motility and brain-associated functions. This investigation thus yielded a program capable of accurately predicting a miRNA target not predicted by any other target prediction program, verified a previously unknown miRNA:target interaction with functional consequences in cancer cells and provided the first steps towards investigating miR-7-mediated regulation in greater depth. Furthermore, EGFR was, to our knowledge, the first example of a verified miRNA target with target sites that are not conserved across mammals, an observation with important implications for computational target prediction and the evolution of miRNA regulatory systems. In addition, the demonstrated growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of miR-7 on lung cancer cells raise the possibility of a miR-7-based therapeutic for the treatment of EGFR-overexpressing tumours.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer</field><field name="subject">Lungs -- Cancer</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Growth factors</field><field name="subject">Lectins</field><field name="subject">Cancer cells -- Proliferation</field><field name="subject">Cancer cells -- Motility</field><field name="subject">MicroRNA</field><field name="subject">EGFR</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0179</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linking seafloor mapping and ecological models to improve classification of marine habitats : opportunities and lessons learnt in the Recherche Archipelago, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Baxter, Katrina</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Spatially explicit marine habitat data is required for effective resource planning and management across large areas, although mapped boundaries typically lack rigour in explaining what factors influence habitat distributions. Accurate, quantitative methods are needed. In this thesis I aimed to assess the utility of ecological models to determine what factors limit the spatial extent of marine habitats. I assessed what types of modeling methods were able to produce the most accurate predictions and what influenced model results. To achieve this, initially a broad scale marine habitat survey was undertaken in the Recherche Archipelago, on the south coast of Western Australia using video and sidescan sonar. Broad and more detailed functional habitats types were mapped for 1054km2 of the Archipelago. Broad habitats included high and low profile reefs, sand, seagrass and extensive rhodolith beds, although considerable variation could be identified from video within these broad types. Different densities of seagrass were identified and reefs were dominated by macroalgae, filter feeder communities, or a combination of both. Geophysical characteristics (depth, substrate, relief) and dominant benthic biota were recorded and then modelled using decision trees and a combination of generalised additive models (GAMs) and generalised linear models (GLMs) to determine the factors influencing broad and functional habitat variation. Models were developed for the entire Archipelago (n=2769) and a subset of data in Esperance Bay (n=797), which included exposure to wave conditions (mean maximum wave height and mean maximum shear stress) calculated from oceanographic models. Additional distance variables from the mainland and islands were also derived and used as model inputs for both datasets. Model performance varied across habitats, with no one method better than the other in terms of overall model accuracy for each habitat type, although prevalent classes (&gt;20%) such as high profile reefs with macroalgae and dense seagrass were the most reliable (Area Under the Curve &gt;0.7). ... This highlighted not only issues of data prevalence, but also how ecological models can be used to test the reliability of classification schemes. Care should be taken when mapping predicted habitat occurrence with broad habitat models. It should not be assumed that all habitats within the type will be defined spatially, as this may result in the distribution of distinctive and unique habitats such as filterfeeders being underestimated or not identified at all. More data is needed to improve prediction of these habitats. Despite the limitations identified, the results provide direction for future field sampling to ensure appropriate variables are sampled and classification schemes are carefully designed to improve descriptions of habitat distributions. Reliable habitat models that make ecological sense will assist future assessments of biodiversity within habitats as well as provide improved data on the probability of habitat occurrence. This data and the methods developed will be a valuable resource for reserve selection models that prioritise sites for management and planning of marine protected areas.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquatic habitats</field><field name="subject">Ocean bottom -- Remote-sensing maps</field><field name="subject">Marine habitats</field><field name="subject">Predictive modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0181</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An in vitro and in vitro study on the role of the glycoprotein fibulin-3 in olfactory nerve growth and repair</field><field name="creator">Vukovic, Jana</field><field name="description">The primary olfactory pathway in adult mammals has retained a remarkable potential for self-repair. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), specialized glial cells within the olfactory nerve, are thought to play an important role in the ongoing growth and replenishment of sensory connections in this system. To gain insight into novel molecules that could mediate OEC-supported growth of axons within the olfactory nerve, gene expression profiling experiments revealed very high expression of the fibulin-3 glycoprotein in OECs. To date, research on fibulin-3 has been limited and mainly focused on its involvement in Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy, vasculogenesis and tumor formation. As the extracellular matrix associated with OECs is thought to be an important contributor to a growth-permissive environment, the main aim of this thesis was to define a putative role for fibulin-3 during olfactory receptor neuron replacement and regeneration. This hypothesis was investigated in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments that involved lentiviral vectors to manipulate fibulin-3 gene expression in OECs as well as the use of knock-out mice. Using genetically-modified OECs, experimental data showed that increased levels of fibulin-3 induced morphological changes in OECs and also impeded their migration. Lentiviral vector-mediated expression of fibulin-3 in OECs also had an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion explants. On the other hand, knock-down of fibulin-3 levels via siRNA technology resulted in reduced proliferation. Comparative lesioning experiments in fibulin-3 knock-out and wild-type mice allowed for further assessment of a role for fibulin-3 in olfactory nerve repair in vivo. Two experimental injury models, i.e. epithelial (Triton-X) lesioning and olfactory bulbectomy, were employed. The results obtained were in line with in vitro observations. A lack of fibulin-3 in knock-out mice resulted in a seemingly augmented regeneration of the olfactory epithelium at 10 days post-injury. However, at the latest recovery time point of 42 days post-injury, an impaired recovery of the olfactory epithelium from the experimental insults was observed. Although the precise mechanism for the latter phenomenon is not yet fully understood, our data point towards several factors which include vascular abnormalities and altered cell proliferation within the olfactory epithelium. Additionally, the precise protein distribution of another wide-spread family of extracellular matrix molecules, the laminins, was investigated in this thesis. It was of interest to investigate the spatiotemporal expression of laminin isoforms during iii olfactory nerve development and regeneration as these molecules may have distinct roles in promoting olfactory sensory neuron growth and patterning. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies concluded that laminin-211 and laminin-411 were the most likely candidates to play such a role. In summary, this thesis provides new insights into the role of the extracellular matrix, fibulin-3 in particular, in regulating cell migration, division and axonal growth in the primary olfactory pathway. Such knowledge also gives a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which OEC transplants may enhance axonal regeneration elsewhere in the CNS.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extracellular matrix</field><field name="subject">Olfactory nerve -- Regeneration</field><field name="subject">Olfactory system</field><field name="subject">Olfactory ensheathing cells</field><field name="subject">Fibulin-3</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0182</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technologies of power : discipline of Aboriginal students in primary school</field><field name="creator">Gillan, Kevin P.</field><field name="description">This study explored how the discursive practices of government education systemic discipline policy shape the behaviour of Aboriginal primary school students in an urban education district in Western Australia. First, this study conducted a Foucauldian genealogical discourse analysis of the historical and contemporary discursive forces that shaped systemic discipline policy in Western Australian government schools between 1983 and 1998 to uncover changing discursive practices within the institution. This period represented a most turbulent era of systemic discipline policy development within the institution. The analysis of the historical and contemporary discursive forces that shaped policy during this period revealed nine major and consistent discursive practices. Secondly, the study conducted a Foucauldian genealogical discourse analysis into the perspectives of key interest groups of students, parents and Education Department employees in an urban Aboriginal community on discipline policy in Education Department primary schools during the period from 2000 to 2001; and the influence of these policies on the behaviour of Aboriginal students in primary schools. The analysis was accomplished using Foucault's method of genealogy through a tactical use of subjugated knowledges. A cross section of the Aboriginal community was interviewed to examine issues of consultation, suspension and exclusion, institutional organisation and discourse. The study revealed that there are minimal consistent conceptual underpinnings to the development of Education Department discipline policy between 1983 and 1998. What is clear through the nine discursive practices that emerged during the first part of the study is a strengthened recentralising pattern of regulation, in response to the influence of a neo-liberal doctrine that commodifies students in a network of accountability mechanisms driven by the market-state economy. Evidence from both genealogical analyses in this study confirms that the increasing psychologisation of the classroom is contributing towards the pathologisation of Aboriginal student behaviour. It is apparent from the findings in this study that Aboriginal students regularly display Aboriginality-as-resistance type behaviours in response to school discipline regimes. The daily tension for these students at school is the maintenance of their Aboriginality in the face of school policy that disregards many of their regular cultural and behavioural practices, or regimes of truth, that are socially acceptable at home and in their community but threaten the 'good order' of the institution when brought to school. This study found that teachers and principals are ensnared in a web of governmentality with their ability to manoeuvre within the constraints of systemic discipline policy extremely limited. The consequence of this web of governmentality is that those doing the governing in the school are simultaneously the prisoner and the gaoler, and in effect the principle of their own subjection. Also revealed were the obscure and dividing discursive practices of discipline regimes that contribute to the epistemic violence enacted upon Noongar students in primary schools through technologies of power.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Education -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Education and state -- Australia -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Primary school teaching -- Australia -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal education</field><field name="subject">Discipline policy</field><field name="subject">Foucauldian discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Primary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0183</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Location-free node scheduling schemes for energy efficient, fault tolerant and adaptive sensing in wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Pazand, Babak</field><field name="description">Node scheduling is one of the most effective techniques to maximize the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. It is the process of selecting a subset of nodes to monitor the sensor field on behalf of redundant nodes. At every round of the scheduling a small group of nodes are active while the rest of the sensor nodes are in sleep mode. In this thesis, we propose a novel node scheduling solution for wireless sensor networks. The main characteristic of our approach is its independence from location information as well as distance information. Moreover, it does not rely on unrealistic circular radio propagation models. In order to have a comprehensive solution, we have considered different relations between sensing range and transmission range. When these ranges are equal in addition to the case that transmission range is higher than sensing range, we devise a node scheduling scheme based on the concept of Minimum Dominating Set. Two heuristics are presented to determine a collection of minimum dominating sets of the graph of the wireless sensor network. At each round of the scheduling only one set is active. Minimum dominating sets are scheduled to be rotated periodically. Moreover, every set is synchronized prior to the end of its active period in order to minimize the effect of clock drift of sensor nodes. Two components are considered to address node failures during the on-duty period of minimum dominating sets. These are probing environment and adaptive sleeping. The former is responsible for probing the working nodes of the active set to detect any node failure. The latter adjusts the frequency of probing for minimizing the overhead of probing while preserving an adequate level of robustness for discovery of node failure. This framework is based on the PEAS protocol that has been developed by Fan Ye et al. [98, 99]. We propose a different node scheduling scheme with a three-tier architecture for the case that sensing range is higher than transmission range. The coverage tier includes a set of nodes to monitor the region of the interest. We propose a heuristic to determine a collection of d-dominating sets of the graph of the wireless sensor network. At every round of the scheduling one d-dominating set forms the coverage tier. Connectivity tier consists of sensor nodes that relay the data collected at the coverage tier back to the base station. Finally, the coverage management tier is responsible for managing different patterns of coverage such as cyclic or uniform coverage.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sensor networks</field><field name="subject">Wireless LANs</field><field name="subject">Node scheduling</field><field name="subject">Coverage problem</field><field name="subject">Adaptive sensing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0185</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Afterlife, but not as we know it : medicine, technology and the body resurrected</field><field name="creator">Lizama, Natalia</field><field name="description">This thesis contends that technologically-derived resurrections of human bodies and bodily fragments can be viewed as indicative of a 'post-biological' ontology. Drawing from examples in which human bodies are resurrected, both figuratively and actually, this thesis puts forward the term 'post-biological subject' as an ideological framework for conceptualising the reconfiguration of human ontology that results from various medical technologies that 'resurrect' the human body. In this instance, the term 'postbiological', borrowed from Hans Moravec who uses it denote a future in which human being is radically disembodied and resurrected within a digital realm, is used somewhat ironically: where Moravec imagines an afterlife in which the body is discarded as so much 'meat', the post-biological afterlife of the body in this thesis centres around a form of corporeal resurrection. Corpses, living organs and excreta may all be resurrected, some of them in digital format, yet this kind of resurrection departs radically from the disembodied spiritual bliss imagined in many conceptualisations of resurrection. The post-biological subject resists ontological delineation and problematises boundaries defining self and other, living and dead, and human and nonhuman and is fraught with a number of cultural anxieties about its unique ontological status. These concerns are analysed in the context of a number of phenomena, including melancholy, horror, monstrosity and the uncanny, all of which similarly indicate an anxious fixation with human ontology. The purpose of discussing post-biological bodies in relation to phenomena such as melancholy or the uncanny is not to reinstate as ideological frameworks the psychoanalytic models from which these concepts are derived, but rather to use them as starting points for more complex analyses of postbiological ontology. The first and second chapters of this thesis discuss instances in which the human body is posthumously modified, drawing on Gunther von Hagens's Body Worlds exhibition and the Visible Human Project. The Body Worlds plastinates are situated in a liminal and ambiguous ontological space between life and death, and it is argued that their extraordinary ontological status evokes a form of imagined melancholy, wherein the longed-for and lost melancholic object is a complete process of death. In the case of the Visible Human Project, it is argued that the gruesome and highly technologised process of creating the Visible Male, wherein the corpse is effectively dehumanised and iv rendered geometric, evokes the trope of horror, while at the same time being fraught with a nostalgic longing for a pre-technological, anatomically 'authentic' body. The third and fourth chapters of this thesis discuss instances in which the living human body is reconfigured, focusing on immortal cell lines and organ transplantation, and on medical imaging technologies such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. In the third chapter it is argued that organ transplantation and the creation of immortal cell lines give rise to profound anxieties about ontological contamination through their capacity to render permeable the imagined boundaries defining self, and in this way invoke the monstrous. The fourth chapter interrogates the representation of medical imaging in Don DeLillo?s novel White Noise, arguing that the medical representation of the body functions as a form of double, a digital doppelganger that elicits an uncanny anxiety through its capacity to presage death.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resurrection</field><field name="subject">Humanism -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Body, Human (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Organ transplantation</field><field name="subject">Posthumanism</field><field name="subject">The Visible Human Project</field><field name="subject">Body Worlds</field><field name="subject">HeLa cell line</field><field name="subject">Resurrection</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0186</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptual features for speech recognition</field><field name="creator">Haque, Serajul</field><field name="description">Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is one of the most important research areas in the field of speech technology and research. It is also known as the recognition of speech by a machine or, by some artificial intelligence. However, in spite of focused research in this field for the past several decades, robust speech recognition with high reliability has not been achieved as it degrades in presence of speaker variabilities, channel mismatch condi- tions, and in noisy environments. The superb ability of the human auditory system has motivated researchers to include features of human perception in the speech recognition process. This dissertation investigates the roles of perceptual features of human hearing in automatic speech recognition in clean and noisy environments. Methods of simplified synaptic adaptation and two-tone suppression by companding are introduced by temporal processing of speech using a zero-crossing algorithm. It is observed that a high frequency enhancement technique such as synaptic adaptation performs better in stationary Gaussian white noise, whereas a low frequency enhancement technique such as the two-tone sup- pression performs better in non-Gaussian non-stationary noise types. The effects of static compression on ASR parametrization are investigated as observed in the psychoacoustic input/output (I/O) perception curves. A method of frequency dependent asymmetric compression technique, that is, higher compression in the higher frequency regions than the lower frequency regions, is proposed. By asymmetric compression, degradation of the spectral contrast of the low frequency formants due to the added compression is avoided. A novel feature extraction method for ASR based on the auditory processing in the cochlear nucleus is presented. The processings for synchrony detection, average discharge (mean rate) processing and the two tone suppression are segregated and processed separately at the feature extraction level according to the differential processing scheme as observed in the AVCN, PVCN and the DCN, respectively, of the cochlear nucleus. It is further observed that improved ASR performances can be achieved by separating the synchrony detection from the synaptic processing. A time-frequency perceptual spectral subtraction method based on several psychoacoustic properties of human audition is developed and evaluated by an ASR front-end. An auditory masking threshold is determined based on these psychoacoustic e?ects. It is observed that in speech recognition applications, spec- tral subtraction utilizing psychoacoustics may be used for improved performance in noisy conditions. The performance may be further improved if masking of noise by the tonal components is augmented by spectral subtraction in the masked region.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automatic speech recognition</field><field name="subject">Signal processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Speech processing systems</field><field name="subject">Speech synthesis</field><field name="subject">Perceptual features for speech recognition</field><field name="subject">Two-tone suppression for ASR</field><field name="subject">Synoptic adaptation</field><field name="subject">Compressive non-linearity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0187</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Micromechanical investigation of MEMS-based short-wave infrared tunable Fabry-Perot filters</field><field name="creator">Walmsley, Byron Alan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This study investigates the mechanical and physical properties of low-temperature (100-300 ?C) plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposited (PECVD) silicon nitride (SiNxHy) thin films for the fabrication of short-wave infrared tunable Fabry-Perot filters with high fill factor, high cavity finesse and low actuation voltages. It has been the intensions of this work to fabricate a tunable filter that can be monolithically integrated with temperature-sensitive substrates, namely mercury cadmium telluride (Hg(1-x)CdxTe) photoconductors and photodiodes. A range of methods have been utilised to determine the Young's modulus (E), residual stress ([sigma]0), density ([rho]) and Poisson's ratio ([nu]) of PECVD SiNxHy thin films. In order to understand how E, [sigma]0, [rho] and [nu] are affected by process conditions, a range of SiNxHy thin films deposited with varying chuck temperatures, RF powers and chamber pressures were measured. The resonance method was used to determine E and [nu] of SiNxHy thin films deposited under varying process conditions. The resonance method involves exciting the bending and torsional vibration modes of a microcantilever beam fabricated from a film. The E and G values can be extracted directly from the bending and torsional vibration modes and the [nu] value can be determined from the calculated E and G values. The density of the films was determined using the quartz crystal microbalance method. In order to determine the validity of the resonance method, finite element modelling was used to determine its dependence on microcantilever beam dimensions. ...  Increasing the temperature also increases the tensile residual stress of the films. This study also reveals that increasing the RF power and decreasing the chamber pressure increases E and [rho], as well as increasing the compressive residual stress of the films. The theoretical design and analysis, as well as the fabrication of a new surface micromachined short-wave infrared tunable Fabry-Perot filter for adaptive infrared photon detectors is also presented in this study. The proposed structure, termed the suspension filter, uses broad spectral range, high reflectivity distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirrors, resulting in very high finesse filters. The device utilises multiple sacrificial layers to define the resonant cavity spacer and the separation of the top mirror from the supporting flexures. The flexures were fabricated from low-temperature (PECVD) SiNxHy thin films. Separation of the top mirror from the supporting flexures allows for improved fill-factors (up to 79%), as well as increased tuning range. Theoretical optical and electromechanical results shows large wavelength tuning ranges (1.5-2.5 [mu]m) at low actuation voltages (&lt;30 V) are possible using the proposed design, whilst still maintaining a high cavity finesse. Optical characterisation of fixed filter micro-cavities on Si substrates show transmissions of ~60% with small line widths (35 nm) are achievable using the proposed mirror system. Mirror displacement versus applied bias voltage curves obtained from a released filter fabricated on Si show a stable mirror displacement of 620 nm was achieved, whilst theoretical results suggested the required 750 nm mirror displacement is possible using the proposed design.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microelectromechanical systems</field><field name="subject">Fabry-Perot interferometers</field><field name="subject">Thin films</field><field name="subject">MEMS</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0188</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and phantom-based studies of the validity and value of quantitative radiological hip structural analysis</field><field name="creator">Khoo, Benjamin Cheng Choon</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Areal bone mineral density (BMD) is measured routinely in the clinic by a quantitative radiological technique, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BMD is used widely to assess non-invasively but indirectly the mechanical fragility of bone and consequently is able to predict fracture risk. While BMD correlates well with in vitro measurements of bone strength it does not directly measure a mechanical property; half of incident minimally traumatic fractures in women occur with BMD values above the World Health Organisation defined threshold for osteoporosis. This arises partly because the mechanical strength of bone is dependent on its structural geometry and material strength as well as bone mineral mass. Essentially, bones fracture when load stresses exceed the mechanical capacity of the material to withstand them. The structural geometry (i.e., the amount of bone tissue and its complex three-dimensional arrangement within the macroscopic bone envelope) defines the stresses produced by a given load, while the intrinsic load capacity of the material is defined by the composition and microstructure of the bone tissue itself. Hip structural analysis (HSA) is a technique that elucidates the structural geometric component of bone strength; essentially combining information available from conventional DXA images of the proximal femur with a biomechanical beam model based on the stresses arising in a combination of pure bending and axial compression. A version of HSA has recently been released commercially, and has obtained US Food and Drug Administration approval for its clinical application. ... Given the acknowledged limitations of the HSA method when applied to 2-D projection images, a 3-D approach to structural geometry, using imaging modalities such as pQCT and QCT or a recently introduced version of DXA that mimics QCT, is indicated for the future. With that in mind and the possibility of the anthropometric phantom being adopted for future accuracy and precision assessments, improvements in the design of this phantom are recommended. Studies to better understand and verify Contents v the relevance of the 'local buckling' phenomenon as a structural geometric factor in the genesis of macro-fractures are also recommended. In summary, it is essential that superior (compared to BMD) non-invasively determined clinical predictors of bone fragility leading to fracture be investigated. Structural geometric variables are potential candidates. This has led to consideration of; (i) the need to progress beyond BMD for a more sensitive and specific bone strength measurement; (ii) theoretical advantages of structural geometry over BMD; (iii) limitations of the current HSA technique based on DXA, including those introduced by its restrictive assumptions; (iv) the value of HSA in longitudinal studies, exemplified by the 'normal' but rapid skeletal changes seen in human lactation, with possible implications for an analogous study of the menopause; and (v) an investigation, using a custom-designed anthropometric phantom, of the adaptation of HSA to certain emerging imaging modalities and methods able to resolve bone structural geometry in three dimensions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Absorptiometer</field><field name="subject">Anthropometry</field><field name="subject">Bone densitometry</field><field name="subject">X-ray densitometry in medicine</field><field name="subject">X-ray spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Hip structure analysis</field><field name="subject">Structural geometry</field><field name="subject">Anthropometric phantom</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0189</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of genetic counselling for familial breast cancer on women's psychological distress, risk perception and understanding of BRCA testing</field><field name="creator">Elliott, Diana</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Background: A review of the literature indicated there was a need for more long-term randomised controlled studies on the effects of BRCA counselling/testing on high risk women, including improved strategies for risk communication. Reviews have also shown women are confused about the significance of inconclusive or non informative results with a need for more research in this area. Aims: The general aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of breast cancer genetic counselling on psychological distress levels, perception of risk, genetic knowledge and understanding of BRCA testing/test results in a cohort of 207 women from high risk breast cancer families who were referred for genetic counselling in Perth during the period 1997 to 2001. Short- and long-term impact of BRCA genetic counselling/testing was determined in women with and without cancer in a randomised controlled trial as part of which women were randomised to either receive immediate versus delayed genetic counselling. This included family communication patterns before BRCA testing, anticipated outcomes of testing on oneself and family including intentions for result disclosure. Comprehension of index and predictive BRCA testing with possible results was assessed both in the short- and the long-term and understanding of individual or family BRCA test results was evaluated at long-term. The effect of genetic counselling on breast cancer risk perception in unaffected women was evaluated. This study considered a theoretical framework of educational learning theories to provide a basis for risk communication with possible relevance for future research. ... Only 25% of the original study population (52/207) reported BRCA results and women's understanding of results is concerning. Key findings were: 1. The majority of affected women received an inconclusive result. 2. Out of twelve unaffected women who reported results, seven were inconclusive which are not congruent with predictive testing. This implies that these women did not understand their test result. 3. A minority of untested relatives did not know whether a family mutation had or had not been found in their tested family member or what their actual test result was. This implies either a lack of disclosure or that woman did not understand the rationale for and significance of testing for a family mutation. 4. Three relatives did not understand a positive result was a mutation. Conclusion: The implication of this research for breast cancer counselling and testing services is that women who wait for counselling are no worse off in terms of short- or long-term general psychological distress than women who receive the intervention early. There is a suggestion that unaffected women without the disease found counselling more advantageous than affected women. The meaning of BRCA results as reported by women is concerning particularly women's understanding of negative and inconclusive results and further research is needed in this area. Too much information presented at counselling may affect women's comprehension of risk, BRCA testing and future test results and further research is required to evaluate the effects of information overload.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BRCA genes -- Diagnostic use -- Perth(W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer -- Diagnosis -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Genetic counseling -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Genetic screening -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Familial breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Psychological distress</field><field name="subject">BRCA testing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0190</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vitamin E metabolism in humans</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Michael William</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Vitamin E is comprised of a family of tocopherols (TOH) and tocotrienols. The most studied of these is [alpha]-tocopherol ([alpha]-TOH), as this form is retained within the body and any deficiency of vitamin E is corrected with this supplement. [alpha]-TOH is a lipid-soluble antioxidant required for the preservation of cell membranes and potentially acts as a defense against oxidative stress. Individuals who have a primary vitamin E deficiency such as low birth weight infants, secondary vitamin E deficiency due to fat malabsorption such as in abetalipoproteinaemia, or a genetic defect in TOH transport require supplementation. There is debate as to whether vitamin E supplementation in other patient groups is required. Vitamin E supplementation has been recommended for persons with FHBL, a rare disorder of lipoprotein metabolism that leads to low serum [alpha]-TOH and decreased LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B concentrations. We examined the effect of truncated apoB variants on vitamin E metabolism and oxidative stress in persons with heterozygous FHBL. We used HPLC with electrochemical detection to measure [alpha]- and [gamma]-TOH in serum, erythrocytes, and platelets, and GC-MS to measure urinary F2-isoprostanes and TOH metabolites as markers of oxidative stress and TOH intake, respectively. Erythrocyte [alpha]-TOH was decreased, but we observed no differences in lipid-adjusted serum TOHs, erythrocyte [gamma]-TOH, platelet [alpha]- or [gamma]-TOH, urinary F2-isoprostanes, or TOH metabolites. Taken together, our findings do not support the recommendation that persons with heterozygous FHBL should receive vitamin E supplementation. ... Sesame lignans are natural components of sesame seed oil and there is evidence that these lignans can inhibit CYP450 enzymes, in particular, those responsible for vitamin E metabolism. We hypothesised that sesame seed ingestion would increase serum [gamma]-TOH, lower plasma lipids and inhibit platelet function in human subjects with at least one cardiovascular risk factor. We used HPLC with electrochemical detection to measure [alpha]- and -TOH in serum and GC-MS to measure F2-isoprostanes and TOH metabolites as markers of oxidative stress and TOH intake, respectively. We used high-sensitive C-reactive protein as a measure of systemic inflammation. Platelet function was assessed using the PFA-100 platelet aggregation assay. Although serum [gamma]-TOH increased by 17%, we observed no effect on lipid metabolism, markers of inflammation, oxidative stress or platelet function following treatment with ~25 g/day sesame seeds for five weeks. Our findings challenge the hypothesis that sesame seed ingestion provides beneficial cardiovascular effects. In summary, we have studied the metabolism and transport of both [alpha]- and [gamma]-TOH in humans to evaluate the requirements for supplementation and the effects of vitamin E on platelet function and CYP3A4 activity. Specialised techniques using HPLC were developed to measure serum and cellular TOH concentrations both in supplemented and un-supplemented individuals. We also used GCMS to provide a sensitive, accurate assessment of TOH metabolites and midazolam pharmacokinetics in humans after vitamin E supplementation. We have examined the role vitamin E has on important biochemical endpoints, with emphasis on the implications for TOH supplementation in subjects at risk of CVD.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Diseases -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Tocotrienol</field><field name="subject">Vitamin E -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Vitamin E -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Vitamins in human nutrition</field><field name="subject">Vitamin E</field><field name="subject">Platelets</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease</field><field name="subject">CYP3A4</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0191</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of the competitive swimming track start based on lower limb asymmetry</field><field name="creator">Hardt, Julie E.</field><field name="description">The swimming track start is a complex motor skill that utilizes asymmetric lower limb action. The purpose of this study was to explore whether it could be optimized by applying the commonly accepted view that there are asymmetries in the function and behaviors of the lower limbs. Initially, the study aimed to examine the relationship between various measures of lower limb asymmetry and the swimmers' preferences for forward foot placement in the swimming track start. Participants underwent a 7 week training period whereby both the left foot forward (LFF) and the right foot forward (RFF) track starts were practiced. The philosophy behind this training protocol was to ensure that participants received equal practice with the preferred and non-preferred stance so that a dominant stance, if it existed, could emerge. Consequently, the relationships between the dominant track start stance and the lower limb asymmetry measures could be determined more accurately. Participants were male (N=11) and female (N=11) swimmers, aged 12-16 years, from the UWA-Uniswim National Age Squad. Kinetic and kinematic data were collected for the track start prior to and following the 7 week training intervention. The intervention was finished when a participant had completed approximately 14 dive sessions where both the LFF and RFF track starts were practiced. The performance criterion measure was time to 5 m. Despite significant differences in vertical force and velocity contributions following the intervention, time to 5 m did not improve for either the LFF or the RFF track start. Four different measures of lower limb asymmetry were collected, including footedness, the preferred track start stance, and the dominant take-off limb for the unilateral and bilateral counter-movement jump (CMJ). Sixteen of 22 participants displayed changes in their dominant track start stance. Eleven participants showed biases for one stance (6 for the LFF &amp; 5 for the RFF), and 11 participants remained or became more symmetrical. Results indicated that the preferred track start stance was the only measure of asymmetry that was significantly related to track start performance (x2[2]= 6.71, p=.04 for pre-intervention &amp; x2[2]=7.77, p=.02 for post-intervention). All other measures of lower limb asymmetry were shown to be unrelated to track start preference and performance. It was suggested that the 7 week training intervention did not provide a sufficient amount of time to see conclusive effects on 5 m time or to make conclusive comparisons between the dominant track start stance and measures of asymmetry. Since the preferred track start corresponded with better performance less than 50% of the time, it was suggested that swimmers and coaches experiment with different dive techniques to find the start which is most effective for them and spend more time on them during training.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Swimming -- Starts and turns</field><field name="subject">Swimming -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Lower limb asymmetry</field><field name="subject">Track start</field><field name="subject">Swimming</field><field name="subject">Training intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0192</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differences in university teaching after Learning Management System adoption : an explanatory model based on Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior</field><field name="creator">Renzi, Stefano</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Current literature about university teaching argues that online teaching requires online social learning based on social interaction to be effective. This implies a shift in pedagogy based on engagement and collaboration, instead of trying to reproduce face-to- face teaching, in online environments. However, when a university adopts an elearning platform (or Learning Management System, LMS), most teachers tend to reproduce their traditional teaching, delivering, through the LMS, educational material. This study explored factors which influence university teachers to adopt teaching models based on online social interaction (OSI) when an e-learning platform is used to complement undergraduate classroom teaching. Online teaching model adoption was considered in the framework of technology adoption and post-adoption behavior, i.e., adoption and use by individuals after an organization has adopted an ICT-based innovation (Jasperson, Carter, &amp; Zmud, 2005). Behaviors were investigated using a model based on Ajzen's (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). In total, 26 university teachers  15 from Australia and 11 from Italy  holding undergraduate courses, were recruited. They responded to a semi-structured interview based on the TPB, built on purpose for this research. Teachers were divided into three different groups on the basis of their approach to online teaching, corresponding to three different levels of adoption of OSI.

Christopher</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] One of the standard ways of assessing time since death is from the stages of decomposition of the body. It is well known that the rate of decomposition is affected by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Another factor that can affect decompositional rates is the presence of breaches in the protective barrier of the skin, whether arising from antemortem injury or postmortem damage, including that occurring from animal necrophagy. Scavengers have the potential to affect decomposition by breaching the skin allowing access to associated insect material, feeding on the maggot masses, or by consumption of the carcass itself. Each locality will have its own set of features determining the rate of decomposition of the body, and variation may occur within localities based on the seasons. Such variation implies the need for local calibration of time since death against degree of decomposition and to establish the magnitude of interseasonal variation. When the localities are outdoors, the influence of potential scavengers, and the factors affecting their activity need also to be taken into account. This study investigates the interaction of environmental factors and animal scavenging on the rate of decomposition of pig (Sus scrofa) carcasses at four south-west Western Australia sites; Jandakot, Shenton Park, Perup Forest, and Watheroo National Park. Jandakot and Shenton Park are both close to the Perth metropolitan area and the western coast while Perup Forest is southern and inland and Watheroo is northern and inland. ... The most common insectivore feeding in relation to the carcasses was the Willie Wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys) which was associated with the carcasses in all seasons and all locations except for Perup Forest. The breeding cycle appeared to have a marked influence on the intensity of scavenging by several species. The effect of season on decompositional rates was greatly reduced in carcasses that were exposed to scavenging. It took no additional time for carcasses to achieve skeletonization in winter than in the other seasons in the presence of scavenging. Scavenging had no significant impact on the rate of breakdown of carcasses in summer, when decompositional rates were greatest and scavenging at a minimum. v In Western Australia, it is not uncommon for bodies to remain undiscovered in bush environments for lengthy periods of time due to the low human population density. This study shows conclusively that it is not sufficient simply to consider the accumulated degree day (ADD) when estimating time since death by the degree of decomposition of the body. Attention must also be given to local wildlife assemblages and variations in their activities with the seasons. The implications of this research are in the determination of time of death. If the effects of scavengers accelerate decomposition this must be taken into account when any calculation since time of death is determined. The marked variations between sites in the rates of decomposition of carcasses exposed to natural animal scavenging in this study highlights the need for local calibration of time since death to decompositional stages for all locales. The techniques devised in this study are straight forward and easily conducted yet are informative and essential in determining time since death for bodies which have been exposed to animal scavenging.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic taphonomy</field><field name="subject">Scavengers (Zoology)</field><field name="subject">Biodegradation -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Animal necrophagy</field><field name="subject">Taphonomy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0195</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fate of Islamic Science Between the Eleventh and Sixteenth Centuries: A Critical Study of Scholarship from Ibn Khaldun to the Present</field><field name="creator">Abdalla, Mohamad</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to comprehensively survey and evaluate scholarship, from Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) to the present, on the fate of Islamic science between the eleventh and sixteenth-centuries, and to outline a more adequate scholarly approach. The thesis also assesses the logic and empirical accuracy of the accepted decline theory, and other alternative views, regarding the fate of Islamic science, and investigates the procedural and social physiological factors that give rise to inadequacies in the scholarship under question. It also attempts to construct an intellectual model for the fate of Islamic science, one that examines the cultural environment, and the interactions among different cultural dynamics at work. Drawing upon Ibn Khaldun's theory and recent substantial evidence from the history of Islamic science, this thesis also entails justifying the claim that, contrary to common assumptions, different fates awaited Islamic science, in different areas, and at different times.  For the period of Ibn Khaldun to the present, this thesis presents the first comprehensive review of both classical and contemporary scholarship, exclusively or partially, devoted to the fate of Islamic science for the period under study. Based on this review, the thesis demonstrates that, although the idea that Islamic science declined after the eleventh century has gained a wide currency, and may have been established as the preferred scholarly paradigm, there is no agreement amongst scholars regarding what actually happened. In fact, the lexicon of scholarship that describes the fate of Islamic science includes such terms as: "decline," "decadence," "stagnation," "fragmentation," "standstill," and that Islamic science "froze," to name just a few. More importantly, the study shows that six centuries ago, the Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun provided a more sophisticated and complex theory regarding what happened to Islamic science, which was not utilised except in the work of two scholars. The thesis tests the adequacy of the different claims by applying them to four case studies from the history of Islamic science, and demonstrate that evidence for specified areas shows that different fates awaited Islamic science in different areas and times.  In view of the fact that Ibn Khaldun's theory is six centuries old, and that evidence of original scientific activity beyond the eleventh century emerged in the 1950s, what would one expect the state of scholarship to be? One would expect that with the availability of such evidence the usage of "decline" and other single-faceted terms would begin to disappear from the lexicon of scholarship; scholars would show awareness, and criticism, of each other's work; and development of more and more sophisticated concepts would emerge that would explain the fate of Islamic science. The thesis demonstrates that this did not happen. It argues that the key problem is that, after Ibn Khaldun, there was a centuries-long gap, in which even excellent historians used simple, dismissive terms and concepts defined by a limited, but highly persistent, bundle of interpretative views with a dominant theme of decline. These persistent themes within the scholarship by which Islamic science is constructed and represented were deeply embedded in many scholarly works. In addition, many scholars failed to build on the work of others; they ignored major pieces of evidence; and, in most cases, they were not trying to discern what happened to Islamic science but were referring to the subject as part of another project. Thus, in this corpus of scholarship, one that contains the work of some of the 'best' scholars, the myth of the decline remains not only intact but also powerful. Convinced of its merit, scholars passed it on and vouched for it, failing to distinguish facts from decisions based on consensus, emotion, or tradition. There are very few noteworthy cases where Islamic science is being represented in ways that do not imply negativity. There are also some few narratives that present more complex descriptions; however, even Ibn Khaldun's complex theory, which is arguably the most adequate in the scholarship, is non-comprehensive. Some modern scholars, like Saliba and Sabra, present a challenge to the common argument that Islamic science suffered a uniform decline. However, in the absence of any significant challenges to the common claims of the fate of Islamic science, particularly that of decline, it is evident that, at the very least, the scholarship seems to offer support to the work of discourses that construct the fate of Islamic science in single-faceted, simplistic and reductive terms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Islam</field><field name="subject">Islamic science</field><field name="subject">Islamic medicine</field><field name="subject">Islamic mathematics</field><field name="subject">Islamic astronomy</field><field name="subject">Islamic scholarship</field><field name="subject">Islamic scholars</field><field name="subject">Muslim</field><field name="subject">Middle Ages</field><field name="subject">medieval</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040618.091027</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Methods for Campylobacter and Arcobacter Detection</field><field name="creator">Abu-Halaweh, Marwan</field><field name="description">Twenty species and six subspecies of the genera Arcobacter and Campylobacter have been described to date.

These proteins also have a pivotal role to play in a number of diseases, including cancer. The sialyltransferase enzymes are responsible for transfering sialic acids from the donor substrate (CMP-sialic acid) to growing cell surface glycoconjugate chains within the Golgi apparatus. The CMP-sialic acid synthetase enzymes are responsible for the synthesis of the CMP-sialic acid, the donor substrate of the sialyltransferases in the nucleus, while the CMP-sialic acid transport proteins are responsible for transporting CMP-sialic acid from the Cytosol to the Golgi apparatus. When these proteins function in an abnormal way, hypersialylation results, leading to an increased level of sialylation on the cell surface. This increased level of sialylation aids in the detachment of primary tumour cells due to an increase in the level of overall negative charge, causing repulsion between the cancer cells. Therefore, the sialyltransferase enzymes, CMP-sialic acid synthetases and CMP-sialic acid transport proteins are intimately involved in the metastatic cascade associated with cancer. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction of cancer metastasis, discussing the roles of three target proteins (CMP-sialic acid synthetases, CMP-sialic acid transport proteins and sialyltransferases), as well as discussing their substrate specificities, with an emphasis on their involvements in cancer metastasis. The Chapter concludes with an overview of the types of compounds intended to be utilised as probes or inhibitors of these proteins. Chapter 2 describes the general approach towards the synthesis of CMP-Neu5Ac mimetics with a sulfur linkage in the presence of a phosphate group in the general structure 38. The precursor phosphoramidite derivative 45 was prepared and isolated in a good yield using Py.TFA. Unfortunately, the target compound 38 could not be prepared. Chapter 3 describes an alternative strategy wherein S-linked sialylnucleoside mimetics, of the general structure 39, with a sulfur linkage, but no phosphate group, between the sialylmimetic and the ribose moiety in the base is targeted. A series of these S-linked sialylnucleoside mimetics were successfully prepared. Cytidine, uridine, adenosine and 5-fluorouridine nucleosides were used to create a library of different nucleosides and with structural variability also present in the sialylmimetic portion. This small 'library' of 15 compounds was designed to shed light on the interaction of these compounds with the binding sites of the sialyltranferase, CMP-sialic acid synthetase and/or CM-sialic acid transport protein. Approaches towards the synthesis of O-linked sialylnucleoside mimetics of the general structure 40 are described in Chapter 4. Several methodologies are reported, as well as protecting group manipulations, for successful preparation of these sialylnucleoside mimetics. Cytidine and uridine were employed as the nucleosides, thus allowing a direct comparison between the O- and S-linked sialylnucleoside mimetics in biological evaluation. It appears from these synthetic investigations that gaining access into the O-linked series is not as straightforward as for the S-linked series, with alternative protecting group strategies required for the different nucleosides. The biological evaluation of some of the compounds reported in Chapters 3 and 4 is detailed in Chapter 5. The sialylnucleoside mimetics were evaluated, by 1H NMR spectroscopy, for their ability to inhibit CMP-KDN synthetase. In addition, an initial 1H NMR spectroscopic-based assay was investigated for inhibition studies of &#945;(2,6)sialyltranferase in the absence of potential inhibitors. The final chapter (Chapter 6) brings together full experimental details in support of the compounds described in the preceding Chapters.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tumour metastasis</field><field name="subject">sialyltransferases</field><field name="subject">CMP-sialic acid synthetases</field><field name="subject">CMP-sialic acid transport proteins</field><field name="subject">Golgi apparatus</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061019.111424</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Queer Theory': Intellectual and Ethical Milieux of 1990s Sexual Dissidence</field><field name="creator">Adair, David Francis</field><field name="description">The main problem addressed by this thesis is the question of how to assess the politics and the cultural effects and implications of 'Queer Theory' during the period of the 1990s.  'Queer' was invoked in numerous institutions, spaces, and cultural practices over this period, and yet queer-identified theorists &#150; and many of their critics &#150; have often assumed that this term refers to a relatively unified object.  I ask if it is appropriate to treat these 'queer' occasions in this manner, and whether this 'dispersed' object requires a different approach: one that sets out to describe means and routes by which it became possible and desirable to pose 'queer' problems across so many diverse sites and practices.  In addition, if there are discernible patterns to these distributed cultural capacities and inclinations, what political significance do they have?  These questions inform my account of the career of 'Queer Theory' during the 1990s. A post-humanist approach to these matters is not premised on an essential or a socially constituted general category of 'subjectivity'.  Instead, it addresses 'Queer Theory' as a problem, without automatically critiquing it; it is sceptical of the perfectionist pulsion that has treated this critical practice as either a good or a bad object: dual roles that are mandated by the logic of dialectical criticism.  These roles are exemplified by the frequent relegation of 'queer' in the relevant literature to the 'innately political' or the 'merely aesthetic'.  In this thesis I identify ethical, cultural, and political yields of these conventional choices and the modes of problematisation in which they operate; I positively redescribe them as aesthetico-political practices.  My approach therefore not only deviates from the 'good' or 'bad' critical options, but also from a third option: the equally rationalist response of assuming that 'Queer Theory' is fundamentally a problem of under-theorisation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">queer theory</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">political</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">cultural</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">critical practice</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041014.102015</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Implications for Artistic Expressions and Representations of Corporeality of the Experimental Techniques of Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="creator">Adams, Patricia Lesley</field><field name="description">While biological scientists justify their research into human genetic engineering on the grounds of its 'therapeutic' potential, art - particularly the genre of science fiction (whose origins can be traced to Mary Shelly's famous tale, Frankenstein) - has acted on the social through culture to alert us to the perilous repercussions of usurping the role of the 'Creator of Life.'  Now, at the dawn of the new millennium, the scientific project of mapping human DNA seemingly complete, the plight of the genetically-engineered human has become an intense focus of cultural critique. This doctoral project can be differentiated by its focus on aesthetic inquiry into the implications for expressions and representations of corporeality in relation to contemporary biomedical engineering. It has incorporated stem cell research that entails the manipulation and redirection of adult stem cell fates. The project takes the form of practical and theoretical investigations into cellular responses, and is framed within the matrices of both an innovative collaborative art/science research model and the evolving process of practice-led arts research. The exploratory research is discursively located within the system/environment paradigm. This allows for boundaries between the philosophic and scientific disciplines of: 1. epistemology, 2. ethics and aesthetics and 3. biology and technology  to become nodes in a relational network associated with: 1. living and non-living, 2. sentience and consciousness and 3.  conceptions of humanness. The cycle of practice-led research culminates in a body of work that began with a project entitled apoptosis, and developed into a three part quasi-scientific vital force series of installations. Each of these installations references nineteenth century scientific experimental processes employed in a search for the essential components of the human being itself. The series of interactive installations is discussed and the processual, pioneering research model, whereby the artist becomes the 'human guinea pig' is theoretically and visually articulated. In addition, time-lapse videomicrograph image data, collected through laboratory experiments is interpreted and recontextualised by the artist-researcher for representation in the vital force series of immersive installations. In these installations the implications of the issues raised by biomedical engineering processes are expressed as a very physical, tactile encounter. The aim is that these encounters engender a multi-sensory experience for the individual viewer, who, when immersed in the aesthetic, corporeal, interactive installations as a participant who completes the work through their engagement. Thus, the significance of the study lies in its re-privileging of the aesthetic experience of corporeality in the discourses surrounding genetic manipulation. This exegesis, like the doctoral project itself, is cyclical; following the inseparable processes of theory and practice through which the implications of the core research issues for a hybrid art/science practice are explored. It echoes the qualitative, post-positivist research methodology used throughout the project, which aimed to overcome the third person perspective through such strategies as interactivity and hybridity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">System/environment paradigm</field><field name="subject">epistemology</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">aesthetics</field><field name="subject">biology</field><field name="subject">living and non-living</field><field name="subject">sentience</field><field name="subject">consciousness</field><field name="subject">conceptions of human life</field><field name="subject">post-positivist research methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060707.144314</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Filtration of Ultra-Small Particles on Fibrous Filters</field><field name="creator">Agranovski, Igor Evgenevich</field><field name="description">The problem of filtration of liquid aerosols by both wettable and nonwettable filters has been extensively studied and the results of the theoretical calculations together with the experimental results are presented. More realistic models of filtration by both wettable and nonwettable filters have been developed and verified experimentally. A new instrument has been developed, and used in the experiments, for the measurement of the absolute concentration of aerosols in the gas stream. This instrument is based on the measurement of the initial vapour content of the gas stream simultaneously with the measurement of the vapour content after the total evaporation of aerosol. The concentration of the aerosol is calculated as the difference between these two values. The instrument was developed to provide fast and accurate measurements of aerosol concentration. The main advantages of the instrument are: high accuracy, simplicity of measurement, possibility of use for a wide range of substances, perfect suitability of operation for automatic monitoring technologies, etc. All rights for this instrument have been reserved and the fully automatic version will be available in the near future. It was found that the efficiency of filtration of aerosol on the wettable filter depends on the thickness of the liquid film on the fibre. This parameter was taken into account in the development of a theoretical model of filtration on wettable fibrous filters. The particle breakthrough problem has been solved by the optimisation of the aspect ratio (the ratio of the height by width) of the wettable filter. On this basis, industrial devices have been developed, patented, and implemented in industry. These devices provide a stable operating efficiency of higher than 99%. It was found experimentally that the efficiency of filtration of aerosol on the nonwettable filter depends on the diameter of the drop suspended on the filter, and on the area of the filter blocked by drops: this influences the velocity of filtration. All these parameters were taken into account in the development of a theoretical model of filtration on nonwettable fibrous filters. On the basis of this model, satisfactorily verified by the experiments, an industrial device has been developed. The harnessing of atomisers makes it possible to maintain the efficiency of filtration higher than 99%, even with a relatively high velocity of filtration of 2.7m/s. The new technology is tackling the problem of handling huge amounts of exhaust gases and this is particularly important for cramped installations when the space available for the air pollution control technology is quite limited. A highly efficient gas cleaning technology has been developed. This technology is based on combining two stages (wet scrubber and filter) of currently utilised air pollution control devices by submerging the fibrous filter into the liquid on the plate. The new device provides an effective division of the main gas stream into ultra-small bubbles which increase the contact area between the gas and liquid phases. It was estimated theoretically and verified experimentally that the efficiency of the proposed 'combined' technology, is 45% higher than the efficiency of the two stages technology. The technology has been patented and will be offered for industrial implementation in the near future.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Filtration of liquid aerosols</field><field name="subject">measurement of aerosols</field><field name="subject">wettable filters</field><field name="subject">nonwettable filters</field><field name="subject">filters and filtration</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050913.164528</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Dietary Intake in Kuwait</field><field name="creator">Alajmi, Fahhad</field><field name="description">This study investigated Kuwait food system.

The major part of this study was a National Diet and Nutrition Survey of people aged 20 to 65 years, which is the largest and most detailed survey ever undertaken of the diet and nutritional status of adult people in Kuwait. A food frequency questionnaire was delivered to 491 subjects (response rate 81.8%, 278 female and 213 male). In addition, a sample of 383 (response rate 207 female and 176 male) were interviewed using a 24 hour recall method. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive cross-sectional picture of the dietary habits and nutritional status of the population of Kuwait. The energy and nutrient intakes in the survey were compared with the US RDA.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food and nutrition in Kuwait</field><field name="subject">Dietary habits in Kuwait</field><field name="subject">Kuwait National Diet and Nutrition Survey</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051129.122226</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using Values: a Qualitative Analysis of Ethical Dilemmas Encountered by Australian Lutheran Secondary School Principals</field><field name="creator">Albinger, Kenneth Charles</field><field name="description">Recent studies of effective leadership for schools suggest relationships between the work of principals and beliefs, values and theoretical knowledge. However, it is not clear how these relationships work. In schools of the Lutheran Church of Australia the situation is complicated by expectations that principals will be operating with a Lutheran Christian world view. The precise nature of the role of world view in determining professional action has not been fully researched. This study made use of analysis techniques grounded in symbolic interactionism to examine the construction of meaning and rationale for professional actions by Lutheran secondary school principals. It sought to understand the impact of value on meaning and decision in ethically challenging situations. The central question of this research was: What values influence the reflection of Australian Lutheran secondary school principals as they address ethical dilemmas in their woik? Drawing on the accounts given by three Australian Lutheran secondary pnncipals to provide data for analysis, and making use of membership category analysis techniques, the study found that three statements could be made: 1. There is evidence in the accounts to suggest that the way principals perceive dilemmas is the result of a filtering process where some facts ate not fully considered prior to action. 2. There is evidence in the accounts to suggest that the filtering process is more strongly influenced by sub-rational and trans-rational values than by rational values. 3. There is evidence in the accounts that each piincipal has a world view that is partially shaped by values implicit in the Christian tradition. These findings are tentative because of the limited scope of the research. They have implications for the theoretical literature, suggesting that mote attention needs to be given to the impact of trans-rational and sub-rational values as filters of perception in difficult decisions. 'The findings suggest that any study of the reflection of school principals in ethically challenging situations should take into account the power of non-rational values to be a lens that distorts what is considered in the reflective process'. They also have implications for further research by those interested in Lutheran schools and those interested in the importance of values in shaping perception. Finally they have implications for those who prepare piincipals for Lutheran schools, suggesting the need for a clearer articulation of a philosophy for Lutheran schooling and for the development of the habit of critical reflection in Lutheran principals.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lutheran secondary school principals</field><field name="subject">ethical behaviour</field><field name="subject">leadership for schools</field><field name="subject">Lutheran Christian values</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060815.170949</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the B-Lactamase Gene From Campylobacter Jejuni</field><field name="creator">Alfredson, David</field><field name="description">Thermophilic Campylobacter species such as Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are recognised worldwide as major causes of acute gastroenteritis in humans. Campylobacteriosis is frequently a mild to moderate self-limited illness and most cases do not require antimicrobial therapy; antimicrobial therapy is necessary for patients with systemic Campylobacter infections, for patients with severe disease, or for immunosuppressed patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Campylobacter species using disk diffusion currently is not standardised by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), however, in order to monitor the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter species, there is a need for standardised or calibrated methods of susceptibility testing. Initially, 90 human clinical isolates of thermophilic Campylobacter species from Southeast Queensland, Australia, were screened for resistance to ampicillin, erythromycin and tetracycline using the disk diffusion susceptibility testing method. Levels of resistance were then determined using E test MIC and agar dilution methods to determine the reliability of disk diffusion results. Results of the disk diffusion testing showed 87 (97%) isolates resistant to ampicillin, 14 (16%) isolates were resistant to tetracycline and three (3.4%) isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Results of disk diffusion testing showed 100% correlation (+1 log2 dilution) with agar dilution for erythromycin and tetracycline, and 77% for ampicillin. E test showed 68% correlation with agar dilution for ampicillin, 100% for erythromycin and 64% for tetracycline. These data suggest that disk diffusion susceptibility testing may be used to screen thermophilic Campylobacter spp. for putative resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline and that the incidence of resistance of Campylobacter spp. to erythromycin and tetracycline is low in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Agar dilution remains the most accurate method for determination of ampicillin susceptibility. Numerical analyses of restriction endonuclease (RE) fragment profiles were performed to elucidate relatedness of the antibiotic resistant isolates and the results suggested a high level of isolate variation. The role of the B-lactamase in the resistance of C. jejuni to various B-lactams has been well documented and B-lactamase production in C. jejuni has been reported in 83-93% of strains. The expression and characterisation of the Campylobacter B-lactamase, however, has not been described.  In this work, standard cloning techniques utilising a high-copy number E. coli cloning vector and a previously described E. coli-Campylobacter shuttle cloning vector were unsuccessful in isolation and expression of the C. jejuni B-lactamase gene in E. coli, possibly due to a lack of expression of the campylobacter gene in its host or low efficiency of transformation. Therefore, in order to facilitate the isolation, expression and characterisation of the C. jejuni B-lactamase gene, it was necessary to construct a new E.coli-Campylobacter shuttle cloning vector for the purposes of expressing the C. jejuni B-lactamase in Campylobacter. To aid in the construction of the vector, the sequence and genetic organisation of a 4.0-kb cryptic plasmid, termed pCJ419, identified in a human clinical isolate of C. jejuni was determined. Plasmid pCJ419 is a circular molecule of 4013 bp and contains four open reading frames (ORFs), the products of which share significant sequence similarity with putative proteins from known C. jejuni and C. coli plasmids.  ORF-1 encodes a putative mobilisation protein (Mob); ORF-2 and ORF-3 encode proteins which have high identity to putative RepA and RepB proteins, respectively, of known C. jejuni and C. coli plasmids.  ORF-4 encodes a protein which has high identity to a hypothetical protein of unknown function, Cjp32, previously described in a pVir plasmid of C. jejuni. Tandem repeating sequences typical of a plasmid replication origin (ori) were identified upstream of the DNA sequences encoding putative replication initiation proteins RepA and RepB. An E. coli-Campylobacter shuttle cloning vector, pGU0202, was constructed using plasmid pMW2 which harbours a Campylobacter-derived kanamycin-resistance gene, aphA(3&#146;)-III. The sequences encoding pCJ419 mob, repA and repB were inserted upstream of aphA(3&#146;)-III resulting in a stable construct of 6174 bp that was used successfully to transform both E. coli and Campylobacter. Subsequently, a novel molecular class D ?-lactamase gene, blaOXA-61, from a B-lactamase-positive, ampicillin-resistant (MIC 64 mg l-1), clinical strain of Campylobacter jejuni, strain GC015 was isolated, cloned and characterized using the newly constructed shuttle vector pGU0202.  An open reading frame of 774 bp was identified on a ClaI genomic fragment of 2.2 kb and encodes a protein of 257 amino acids.  Conserved motifs composed of identical amino acids typical of penicillin-recognising proteins and specific class D motifs were identified. blaOXA-61 was cloned into the shuttle cloning vector pGU0202 and expressed in B-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-susceptible C. jejuni and E. coli. A conserved 122-bp sequence directly upstream of blaOXA-61 was identified and shown to be required in cis for high-level resistance of Campylobacter to the penicillins although blaOXA-61 expressed only at low levels in E.coli. Southern hybridisation analysis demonstrated that the bla gene was chromosomally encoded and present on the same BglII and ClaI-digested genomic DNA fragments from various strains of Campylobacter with ampicillin MICs of between 4 and 64 mg l-1. In addition, DNA fragments encoding two putative zinc-dependent hydrolases from the metallo-B-lactamase superfamily, designated GLX2-1 and GLX2-2, were identified in a clinical isolate of Campylobacter jejuni, strain 012, cloned and sequenced. A strictly conserved motif, -H-X-H-X-D-, characteristic of the metallo- B-lactamase superfamily of proteins, including the class B metallo- B-lactamases, was identified in both proteins although functional B-lactamase could not be expressed in either E. coli or C. coli transformed using the C. jejuni hydrolase-containing shuttle vector pGU0202.  Further work is warranted to determine the exact function of these proteins.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Campylobacter jejuni</field><field name="subject">lactamase gene</field><field name="subject">E test</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060111.172351</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Labour Utilisation in Queensland Hospitals</field><field name="creator">Allan, Cameron</field><field name="description">Within Australia and in Europe. there is evidence of growth in the incidence of non&#172;standard forms of employment such as part-time and casual work. Part of this growth can be attributed to changes in the structure of the economy and the increasing importance of service industries where non-standard forms of employment proliferate. There is also evidence, however, that employers at the firm level are progressively expanding their use of non-standard employment and reducing their reliance on full-time labour. One explanation for this organisational-level phenomena has been suggested by Atkinson (1987) in his account of the &#145;flexible firm&#146;. Atkinson claims that employers are increasingly attempting to divide the workforce into two major segments: a skilled, full-time core labour force and an unskilled, non-standard segment. This thesis examines Atkinson&#146;s &#145;flexible firm&#146; model through a study of labour-use practices of three acute hospitals in Queensland. A main finding of this thesis is the generalised and substantial growth of non-standard employment in all types of Queensland hospitals. The growth of non-standard hospital labour is not as, Atkinson would suggest, largely the result of demand-side strategies of employers but is also conditioned by supply-side factors. Gender, rather than skill, is found to be an important determinant of the proliferation of non-standard employment. Non-standard employment is not the major labour adjustment mechanism in all sectors of the hospital industry. Labour intensification is a critical and overlooked form of labour adjustment in the public sector. Overall, this thesis concludes that employers&#146; labour-use practices need to be conceptualised within the context of the opportunities and constraints imposed by the interaction of demand and supply-side factors.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flexible firm</field><field name="subject">non-standard work hours</field><field name="subject">hospital staff</field><field name="subject">labour</field><field name="subject">Queensland hospitals</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050906.171638</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Different Agenda: The Changing Meaning of Public Service Efficiency and Responsiveness in Australia's Public Services</field><field name="creator">Allan, Geoffrey</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the changing nature of efficiency and tesponsiveness of Australian public services over the past century It will examine how over the past 100 years efficiency has been improved and assessed. It will also examine how, since the 1970s, efficiency has become synonymous with responsiveness. The main argument of this thesis is that the nature of efficiency and responsiveness has changed over the past century.. Reforms introduced fiom the 1970s where the rationale at the time was improved efficiency, were essentially designed to make the public service more accountable and thereby responsive to the political executive. The study will examine: 1. the measures governments employed to improve efficiency and assess their effectiveness; 2. how responsiveness became the corollary of efficiency; 3. the resultant changes assessment of government perfbrmance; and 4. the effect these changes had on the Westminster system in Australia. The thesis is in three parts. Part one deals with the nature of public service efficiency and responsiveness. It examines the literature surrounding the nature of the terms and provides a definition of each. Part two details and analyses how public service efficiency was measured and improved from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the 1970s. It will detail the rise and decline in public service boards and commissions and how they were used to initially limit patronage and then to act as monitoring agencies to ensure that public service input costs were as small as they could be 1i will also detail how other factors, such as the training and education of staff and computerisation had an increasing role in improving efficiency. The third part deals with the changes that have occurred since the 1970s. This will examine how responsiveness emerged as an issue and how it became an essential companion to efficiency when promoting bureaucratic change.. It will examine how the nomenclature of efficiency has been applied when the political executive seeks to ensure greater responsiveness from the public service. This third part will examine the main apparatus that were employed by the political executive to improve efficiency and responsiveness: progr am budgeting, corporate planthng, efficiency audits and contracts with senior staff. Finally, I will demonstrate the inability or unwillingness of many ministers and governments to detail policy objectives and their reluctance to evaluate the effectiveness of spending. This was accompanied by a greater reliance on senior employment contracts as the main lever to improve efficiency and responsiveness of the service.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian public services</field><field name="subject">efficiency in government</field><field name="subject">political executive</field><field name="subject">Westminster system</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060914.104311</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preaching in Context: The Role of Preaching in Nazarene Worship</field><field name="creator">Allder, Bruce George</field><field name="description">This qualitative research study explores the role of the sermon in corporate Nazarene worship. The context of this study is located with the Christian, Protestant, evangelical, Wesleyan theological tradition as expressed through the Church of the Nazarene in Australia. The church is briefly described from a Wesleyan perspective. Seven features are identified as historically important within the worship experience of Nazarenes;  Biblically centred, centrality of the sermon, connection with Christian tradition, the preacher's life, encounter with self and the divine, community, and practical and relevant to present life. The conceptual lens through which the worship experiences are described is Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), as primarily articulated by Yrj&#246; Engestr&#246;m (1999). The philosophical roots of CHAT and the concept of activity are described along with the structure of activity. Additionally, the compatibility of Wesleyan theology with the conceptual understanding of CHAT is presented. The interactive context of Nazarene worship is one of the compelling reasons given for using CHAT as the conceptual base for this study. Three corporate Nazarene worship experiences in three different Nazarene congregations are examined in detail using four research methodologies; namely, video taping, video stimulated recall interviews, focus groups, and observation reports. The data gathered is by way of transcriptions based on the video taping of the sermons, stimulated recall interviews and focus groups and is managed by use of the NUD*IST (5) computer program. The observation reports are used to gain insight into specific context issues. Nazarene worship is then mapped by relating the features found to be historically important in Nazarene worship to elements of the activity system. The role of the Bible, the sermon, Christian tradition, the preacher's life, the church community, personal encounter, divine encounter, and the application and the call to decision are identified in CHAT terms. The focus of this study is within Steps 1 and 2 of Engestr&#246;m's (2000) expansive development cycle. Through the mapping of Nazarene worship, tensions are identified and their possible sources explored. The tensions of confrontation versus care, creation of a quiet, meditative environment versus noisy, dynamic environment, planning versus spontaneity, and individual versus community orientation are all explored in turn. Possibilities for resolution of these tensions are suggested as a means of guiding the continued development of the activity of Nazarene worship. Possible resolution of these tensions includes the change of the focus of sermons from confrontation to empowerment, the change of the structure of sermons to encompass the visualisation of the change sought, the change of the perceptions of the preacher to one of a sojourner, and the cultivation of spontaneity within sermon delivery. The static nature of the sermon as an instrument in both the sermon's historical development and the development of the corporate worship experience points to the need for the development of the sermon as a more flexible instrument. These conclusions have implications for the teaching of preaching in schools preparing Nazarene preachers. This study contributes to the conceptual basis for the ongoing development of clergy in their preaching ministry. This study has also made visible the difficulty of applying the conceptual framework of CHAT to the complex situation of corporate Nazarene worship experience. While conceptually it may be possible to differentiate between elements within an activity system, their practical distinction is less precise. This imprecision can create confusion especially at the tertiary and quaternary levels of contradictions and may need more precise articulation of the interactions within the activity system as well as between activity systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nazarene worship</field><field name="subject">Church of Nazarene</field><field name="subject">Christian tradition</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060914.114727</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Destination Competitiveness: Interrelationships Between Destination Planning and Development Strategies and Stakeholders' Support in Enhancing Oman's Tourism Industry</field><field name="creator">Al-Masroori, Rashid Salim</field><field name="description">A critical understanding of stakeholders' involvement in destination tourism planning and development, and the factors that influence their perceptions, opinions and involvement in the decision-making process and evaluation of the destination competitive strategies, is not only important for tourism destination planners and managers, but also for the host community's support for tourism development and the destination's competitiveness. It has been widely recognised that tourism destinations need to plan their development strategies to succeed internationally and gain a sustainable competitive advantage. However, there is scant empirical evidence that addresses approaches in which stakeholder participation in the planning process contributes to destination competitiveness. This study examines the interrelationships between various destination-specific situational factors, including economic, social, political, environmental, and cultural factors, community participation, community attachment, and impact on the development of the Sultanate of Oman's tourism resources and attractions, and in turn the support of its competitive strategies. Furthermore, it investigates potential effects of those interrelationships on the government's initiatives in formulating and implementing tourism development, management and marketing policies/strategies. The key objective is to develop and empirically test a conceptual framework of tourism destination competitiveness that focuses on a stakeholder's perspective of Oman, and investigates the interrelationships between its constructs. Such an approach echoes the stakeholder perspective of 'Third Way' tourism planning suggested by Burns (2004). This study utilises social exchange and stakeholder theory. Accordingly, the research problem is: How does the interrelationship between destination-specific situational factors, stakeholders' perceived power (community participation), and community attachment, impact on the development of Oman's tourism resources and attractions, and in turn the support of its competitive strategies? Furthermore, what effects may those interrelationships have on the government's approaches in formulating and implementing tourism development and marketing policies? A four-step methodological approach including qualitative and quantitative methods was applied. Following research refinement and pilot studies, a total of 987 usable questionnaires were collected from Omani stakeholders using a convenience and quota sampling method. The final empirical results were submitted to three focus groups in Oman for elucidation and confirmation of results, with a particular focus on the practical implications. The hypotheses testing indicated that tourism stakeholders' preferences about tourism resources and attractions development are a function of socio-cultural impacts, economic impacts, and community participation. Furthermore, the results highlighted a strong link between stakeholders' preferences about tourism resources and attractions and support for competitive destination strategies such as destination marketing efforts and activities, and sustainable destination management and practices. Additionally, empirical results supported the existence of a relationship between community participation and community attachment constructs; however this relationship was somewhat negative. The study also did not prove the existence of any relationship between community attachment and preferences about tourism resources and attractions development constructs. Furthermore, new findings that were not hypothesised indicated that tourism stakeholders who perceived socio-cultural and economic impacts were most likely to support further tourism development and competitive destination strategies. Additionally, stakeholders' attachment to their communities had a weak but positive effect on their perception about tourism's environmental impacts and sustainable destination management and practices. The focus group participants mostly confirmed the study's empirical findings with a few diverging opinions regarding some issues such as environmental impacts and mass tourism versus alternative tourism policies. Thus, the study's findings provided various theoretical and methodological contributions, closing the gap in the notions of destination competitiveness and stakeholders' active participation in tourism planning and development. As well, the practical implications of the study's findings could be adopted by Oman's tourism planning authorities to enhance the destination's competitiveness in the international tourism marketplace.

Currently, however, it is common practice to discard this information in favour of features that are derived purely from the short-time magnitude spectrum. There are two reasons for this: 1) the results of some well-known human listening experiments have indicated that the short-time phase spectrum conveys a negligible amount of intelligibility at the small window durations of 20-40 ms used for ASR spectral analysis, and 2) using the short-time phase spectrum directly for ASR has proven di?cult from a signal processing viewpoint, due to phase-wrapping and other problems. In this thesis, we explore the possibility of using short-time phase spectrum information for ASR by considering the two points mentioned above. To address the ?rst point, we conduct our own set of human listening experiments. Contrary to previous studies, our results indicate that the short-time phase spectrum can indeed contribute signi?cantly to speech intelligibility over small window durations of 20-40 ms. Also, the results of these listening experiments, in addition to some ASR experiments, indicate that at least part of this intelligibility may be supplementary to that provided by the short-time magnitude spectrum. To address the second point (i.e., the signal processing di?culties), it may be necessary to transform the short-time phase spectrum into a more physically meaningful representation from which useful features could possibly be extracted. Speci?cally, we investigate the frequency-derivative (or group delay function, GDF) and the time-derivative (or instantaneous frequency distribution, IFD) as potential candidates for this intermediate representation. We have performed various experiments which show that the GDF and IFD may be useful for ASR. We conduct several ASR experiments to test a feature set derived from the GDF. We ?nd that, in most cases, these features perform worse than the standard MFCC features. Therefore, we suggest that a short-time phase spectrum feature set may ultimately be derived from a concatenation of information from both the GDF and IFD representations. For best performance, the feature set may also need to be concatenated with short-time magnitude spectrum information. Further to addressing the two aforementioned points, we also discuss a number of other speech applications in which the short-time phase spectrum has proven to be very useful. We believe that an appreciation for how the short-time phase spectrum has been used for other tasks, in addition to the results of our research, will provoke fellow researchers to also investigate its potential for use in ASR.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Short-time Fourier transform</field><field name="subject">phase spectrum</field><field name="subject">magnitude spectrum</field><field name="subject">speech perception</field><field name="subject">automatic speech recognition</field><field name="subject">overlap-add procedure</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060727.090845</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy Design and the Calculation of Political Risk</field><field name="creator">Althaus, Catherine Eileen</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the concept of political risk. It explores how political actors determine whether something is politically risky and what implications this judgment holds for policy design. It establishes that calculations of political risk are a day-to-day occurrence in political life, that they uniquely and influentially structure the public policy process, and that political risk analysis is a valid and distinct conceptual framework. Surveying an extensive multidisciplinary literature, the thesis clarifies its definition of political risk and identifies a gap in the existing political science literature concerning the concept. It exposes a hiatus between the political science discipline and political practice in the recognition of political risk calculation as a central aspect of political judgment. Because the theory of political risk is underdeveloped in political science, the thesis pieces together the existing wisdom from other disciplines that might inform a definition of political risk.  It then plots a set of hypotheses to assist in constructing a foundational appreciation of what political risk calculation might entail. The thesis tests the resulting hypotheses using empirical research.  A survey of 111 Australian political actors is conducted in order to determine how political risk is understood and operationalised in political practice and to ascertain the consequences of political risk for decision making and policy design.  Survey results are complemented by a comparative analysis of four policy issues.  The case studies selected were the Citizen's Charter and Mad Cow crisis of the British Major Government and the Charter of Social and Fiscal Responsibility and Smart State policies initiated by the Queensland Beattie Government.  The comparative analysis of these cases is designed to add rigour to the interview data.  It also provides additional information concerning the policy design implications of political risk calculation by relating interview findings to substantive policy problems. Together, this multi-method research demonstrates that political risk provides a fresh analytical perspective on public policy. Political risk analysis describes a unique aspect of political reality and explains in new ways the decision making process underpinning policy design. Political risk analysis also defends political action against claims of irrationality and attacks that suggest that politics is based on sheer cynicism, because it shows that political risk calculation boasts a defensible logic of its own.  In fact, the thesis concludes that political risk provides a conceptual tool that begins to unravel some of the 'mystery' of politics that confounds technocratic models of policy analysis.  Awareness of political risk calculation re-establishes political decision making as an endeavour where investigation must proceed with an appreciation of the integrated nature of human judgment that utilises both 'rational' and 'extra-rational' capacities to confront uncertainty.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Political risk</field><field name="subject">political science</field><field name="subject">policy design</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050824.120313</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peculiarities of Nanoparticle Formation and Implications to Generation of Environmental Aerosols</field><field name="creator">Altman, Igor</field><field name="description">This Thesis considers peculiarities of nanoparticle formation from the gas in different systems. The main role of the surface condensation in the nanoparticle growth in metal flames was established through a series of experiments and was described by the developed model. The stagnation of the post-nucleation nanoparticle growth was experimentally revealed and theoretically explained. The influence of generation conditions on the post-processing nanoparticle properties was examined. The non-isothermal approach to correct the homogeneous nucleation theory was developed. The results of this work can be summarized in 3 categories: (1) Nanoparticle formation in metal flames. In this work, it was demonstrated that the surface condensation is a main process responsible for nanooxides growth during metal combustion. It was shown that the rate of this condensation growth is consistent with the exponential law, which could lead to the formation of the lognormal particle size distribution in the system, where the Brownian coagulation is suppressed. The post-nucleation stagnation of the nanoparticle growth was found. The particle overheating was suggested as a cause of the growth stagnation. The found stagnation leads to the accumulation of the supercritical clusters in the system generating nanoparticles. The role of these supercritical clusters in the nanoparticle agglomeration was considered. (2)	Study of properties of nanoparticles generated in different metal flames. The light absorption, photoluminescence and magnetic properties of nanoparticles produced in different metal flames were examined. The significant broadening of the absorption edge was found in nanooxides produced by direct metal combustion. This broadening allowed one to excite the unforeseen photoluminescence from these nanoparticles. The significant light absorption in the visible light found in the titania particles produced by metal combustion allows one to consider these particles as a prospective photocatalyst. The unusual optical properties revealed were related to the extreme conditions of the nanoparticle formation, namely, to high energy release (about 5 eV per condensing molecule). The stabilization of spinel structure was found in iron oxide particles synthesized by iron combustion. It allowed one to produce nanoparticles with magnetization close to the high-limit value of the bulk. (3) Approach to correct the homogeneous nucleation theory. The existing homogeneous nucleation theory implies that nucleation occurs at isothermal conditions, i.e. subcritical clusters have the same temperature as the ambient gas does. However, the theory overestimates the actual nucleation rate and underestimates the critical cluster size. It is understandable that due to release of the latent heat of condensation, the cluster temperature in the nucleating system should be higher than the environment temperature. In this work, it was suggested the method to account for the cluster overheating during nucleation. It was demonstrated that the consistent description of the detailed balance in the nucleating system may allow one to evaluate magnitudes of overestimation of the actual nucleation rate and underestimation of the number of molecules in the critical cluster, usually obtained by the isothermal nucleation theory. The numerical estimates are in good agreement with the wellknown experimental results. The implications of the results to generation of atmospheric aerosols were discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanoparticle formation</field><field name="subject">metal flames</field><field name="subject">homogeneous nucleation theory</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051111.122816</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated Study of Coastal Wetland Characteristics and Geomorphic Processes in a South East Queensland Catchment</field><field name="creator">Anorov, Julie Margaret</field><field name="description">Coastal wetlands are dynamic ecosystems that are highly susceptible to change due to natural and human factors. The study area, located within the Native Dog Creek sub-catchment of the Logan River - which drains into Moreton Bay, south east Queensland - holds a detailed history of environmental change spanning most of the Holocene epoch. This history is preserved in the estuarine sedimentary record and is a valuable indicator of natural environmental change. More recently, human-induced changes within the study area have been superimposed on the natural process of environmental change. In order to develop a conceptual bio-geomorphic model of the coastal wetlands of Native Dog Creek, this thesis examined - on an integrated catchment basis - the evolution and connectivity of four coastal wetland community types (Melaleuca, Casuarina, saltmarsh and mangroves). The research consisted of four discrete studies within the study area: a geomorphic investigation that provided a framework for understanding how the wetlands evolved during the Holocene epoch; an acid sulfate soil (ASS) study that surveyed the distribution and concentration of sulfides; a palynological study that examined the natural directions of ecosystem change; and an investigation of the impact of specific human activities on these ecosystems. Detailed stratigraphic modelling found that the Logan River system (and its Native Dog Creek sub-catchment) has evolved from an infilling estuary since the peak of the Holocene transgression 6500 years before present. Recognition of the major controls that influenced geomorphic coastal development during the Holocene, provided important insights into the distribution and genesis of estuarine pyritic sediments which strongly influence the soils within the study area. In general, the estuarine central basin and fluvial delta sediments posed the greatest risk to the environment from acidification if disturbed. The major focus of the ASS study was to survey the distribution of ASS and to identify other areas most vulnerable to acidification. A predictive approach that combined chemical and stratigraphic analysis was used. Results showed that these areas are intrinsically related to their environment of deposition. The study found, for example, that the alternation of excessively wet and dry conditions - combined with high organic carbon levels and variations in microtopography - provided ideal conditions for the re-formation of pyrite in the stream channel within the Melaleuca wetlands. The palaeo-environmental study reconstructed the evolution of Holocene coastal wetland vegetation during the marine transgression and subsequent shoreline progradation. Pollen records from the four representative wetland communities (previously mentioned) were examined. The results found the mid-late Holocene vegetation history was controlled by the development of geomorphic features that have affected freshwater input, drainage and salinity. In response to the progradation of the shoreline after sea level stabilised, changes in fossil pollen from mangroves and saltmarsh taxa during the early-mid Holocene, to freshwater taxa during the late Holocene, are estimated to have taken 800 years. Thus, pollen analysis when used in combination with stratigraphic modelling, provided an important point of reference for rates of natural ecological change in response to evolutionary changes to the physical environment. The wetlands within the study area have suffered varying degrees of disturbance since European settlement in the 1820s. The most significant changes occurred during early European settlement, when vast areas of coastal lowlands were cleared for timber, sheep and cattle grazing and for agricultural purposes. A second period of change occurred from 1989 to 1995, when the Melaleuca community suffered dieback in response to hydrological modifications to Native Dog Creek for the development of a golf course. Results indicate that human-induced changes over the past 170 years have occurred at a rate far beyond the ability of the natural ecosystem to adapt or move to a more ecologically sustainable state, at least in the short-term. Hence the current environment is experiencing degradation through both decline in health and loss of indigenous species. The development of a conceptual bio-geomorphic model was based on the integration of results from all four studies, in an effort to provide a holistic understanding of the coastal wetland environment and of the impact of human-induced changes upon that environment. If these vulnerable ecosystems are to be maintained, successful and sustainable coastal management strategies must rely on a sound scientific understanding of the response of a coastal ecosystem to both human and environmental changes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coastal wetland (Queensland</field><field name="subject">Australia)</field><field name="subject">catchment geomorphology</field><field name="subject">geomorphic processes</field><field name="subject">coastal wetlands</field><field name="subject">bio-geomorphic model</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060223.153104</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional Assessment and Nutritional Knowledge of Lifesavers, Ironmen and Lifeguards</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Rhonda Margaret</field><field name="description">Despite surf lifesavers being national icons of good health and good nutrition, surprisingly little factual information is known about the nutritional status of this unique aquatic fellowship. The purpose of this study was to investigate the nutritional intake and nutritional knowledge of three distinct groups of Australian surf lifesavers. Weighed food diaries are commonly used to assess the nutritional intake of athletes but this method has the disadvantage of a heavy respondent burden. Individuals being investigated must be literate and highly motivated to keep accurate records of food and drinks consumed. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) offer an alternative assessment method to weighed food records as they are relatively quick and easy to complete and do not require a high level of literacy. A secondary purpose of this study was to compare seven-day weighed food diaries with a FFQ that had already been validated for use with an older mixed gender population. The nutrient intakes of 60 members of Surf Lifesaving Australia were measured. Nineteen, who were professional lifeguards completed a FFQ. Thirty lifesavers and 11 surf ironmen each completed the FFQ, a seven-day weighed food diary and a nutritional knowledge questionnaire consisting of 15 multiple choice questions. There were significant differences between the three groups in age and activity with ironmen being significantly younger (mean age 22.9yrs) and significantly more physically active (mean 134mins/day) than either lifesavers (mean age, 31.3yrs, mean activity 46min/day) or lifeguards (mean age 35.8yrs, mean activity 65min/day). There were no significant differences in these parameters between lifesavers and lifeguards. The seven-day food diary revealed significant differences in nutrient intake between lifesavers and ironmen. Lifesavers consumed 1 1,807kJ, 125g protein (1.6g/kg) and 327g carbohydrate (4.Og/kg) while ironmen consumed 14,69/kJ, 1519 protein (1.9g/kg) and 4629 carbohydrate (5.6g/kg). Lifesavers and ironmen exceeded the RDIs for all vitamins and minerals measured. The seven day food diary demonstrated significant differences between the lifesavers and ironmen in energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate, alcohol, thiamin, niacin, calcium and iron. When the nutrient analysis data set for the FFQ was checked this method of dietary assessment was found to be unreliable as greater than 20 per cent of subjects were identified as being under-reporters. Lifesavers and ironmen both had good scores on the nutritional knowledge questionnaire and were able to identify groups of foods as being rich sources of fat, fibre, protein and iron. Ironmen were better able to answer questions specifically related to sport nutrition. All three groups meet the current recommendations for daily physical activity. Lifesavers and ironmen meet the current recommendations for, protein, fibre, vitamin and mineral intake and consume alcohol at levels within the current health guidelines. Ironmen have the highest carbohydrate intake which meets the current general health recommendations but consume less than the current special recommendations of sport nutritionists while lifesavers consume only 44% of energy as carbohydrate. These results suggest that while the both lifesavers and ironmen consume a relatively healthy diet only the surf ironmen could possibly be considered nutritional icons.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutritional assessment</field><field name="subject">nutritional knowledge</field><field name="subject">lifesavers</field><field name="subject">ironmen</field><field name="subject">lifeguards</field><field name="subject">food diaries</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051116.121748</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Debt Crises, IMF Policies and Structural Inequality in the Third World</field><field name="creator">Apps, Peter</field><field name="description">The neo-liberal policies of liberalization and deregulation, as utilized by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its dealings with countries of the developing world, tend to facilitate the conditions for financial crisis.  This can be traced by examining the economic crises of Mexico in 1982 and 1994/95, Asia in 1997 and Russia in 1998 and looking at the main causes and triggers of these crises.  It is evident that the financial vulnerability that these countries suffered from existed due to, and not in spite of, these policy prescriptions.  The IMF continues to present these policies as proven successes - a view that this dissertation contests.  Further to this, the policies that the Fund uses are formulated for use in semi-peripheral economies and have little relationship to the actual economic environments of peripheral countries such as those of sub-Saharan Africa or Papua New Guinea.  The ideology of free-markets and globalization is seen as unassailable by the IMF.  By encouraging countries to remain part of the global financial system through debt rescheduling and open-markets policies, the IMF holds an increasingly fragile economic environment together.  This dissertation formulates and tests four hypotheses in relation to Mexico, Asia, Russia and Papua New Guinea and the periphery.  These are - (1) If there are periods of 'irrational exuberance' among investors in Third World debt, these are likely to contribute to debt crises.  (2) If IMF policies are implemented in the Third World as dictated, then their primary benefits will accrue to the elites in those countries and in the developed world.  (3) If Third World countries open their economies to foreign capital, then they are more likely to experience debt crises.  (4) If IMF policies are implemented in peripheral countries, then they are even less likely to be successful than in semi-peripheral countries.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International Monetary Fund</field><field name="subject">IMF</field><field name="subject">debt</field><field name="subject">external debts</field><field name="subject">debtor countries</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">Third World</field><field name="subject">international finance</field><field name="subject">international banks</field><field name="subject">international banking</field><field name="subject">trade liberalization</field><field name="subject">deregulation</field><field name="subject">economic crises</field><field name="subject">financial crises</field><field name="subject">Russia</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Mexico</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031010.143327</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laser Cooling and Trapping of Metastable Neon and Applications to Photoionization</field><field name="creator">Ashmore, Jonathan P</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an in-depth study into the characterization and enhancement of a metastable neon laser cooled and trapped atomic beam. The apparatus consists of a standard Zeeman slowed atomic beam loaded into a magneto-optical trap and was designed for applications to electron scattering experiments and photoionization. The efficiency of the metastable neon atomic source was investigated to determine the ideal cathode type for maximum metastable production and optimal atomic beam velocity haracteristics. A series of characterization measurements were performed on the MOT, and the trap volume and population were investigated for a range of trapping and slowing laser intensities and detunings, together with the MOT and Zeeman slower magnetic fields. The volume measurements were compared to standard Doppler theory and it was found that the Doppler model inadequately explained the trap behaviour. It was found that the MOT population characteristics were governed by two processes: two-body losses that limit the trap population at high densities, and the efficiency of the atom capture process which limits the operational range of the MOT over the various parameters. The trap temperature was determined to be 1.3mK via a time-of-flight technique. This was nearly twice that predicted by Doppler theory and the lack of agreement once again suggests the inadequacies in the Doppler theory to correctly model the experiment. The application of the MOT to the photoionization cross-section measurement of the (2p53p)3D3 state of neon was investigated. The MOT decay technique was utilized to measure cross-section values of o351 = 2.9+0.2 -0.3 x 10 -18cm2 and o363 = 3.1 +0.3 -0.4 x 10-18cm2 at the wavelengths of 351nm and 363nm respectively. This is an increase in accuracy of around a factor of five from previous measurements and it was found that the results agreed well with the values predicted by current theories.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metastable neon</field><field name="subject">laser cooling and trapping</field><field name="subject">photoionization</field><field name="subject">Zeeman slowed atomic beam</field><field name="subject">magneto-optical trap</field><field name="subject">Doppler theory</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060202.153538</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Aberrations in Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer</field><field name="creator">Ashton, Kevin John</field><field name="description">Genetic changes are hallmarks of cancer development involving the activation and/or inactivation of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, respectively. In non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) development, the initiation of genetic mutations results from exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation. Non-melanoma skin cancers are comprised of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Several related cutaneous lesions also exist, of which solar keratoses (SK) are widely accepted as a precursor dysplasia to SCC development. The study of recurrent genetic changes present within NMSC and SK should help reveal causative mutations in skin cancer development. Such analysis could also elucidate links in the genetic similarity of these dysplasia. The rapid screening of numerical changes in DNA sequence copy number throughout the entire genome has been made possible by the advent of comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). This technique enables the identification of net gains and loss of genetic material within a tumour DNA sample. Chromosomal regions of recurrent gain or loss identify loci containing putative oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, respectively with potential roles in NMSC tumourigenesis. Used in conjunction with tissue microdissection and universal degenerate PCR techniques this can enable the elucidation of aberrations in small histologically distinct regions of tumour. Such a technique can utilize archival material such as paraffin embedded tissue, which is the major source of neoplastic material available for cancer research. This study used the CGH technique to investigate aberrations in BCC, SCC and SK samples. The screening of copy number abnormalities (CNAs) in BCC revealed that although these tumours were close to diploid and generally genetically stable, they did contain several recurrent aberrations. The loss of genetic material at 9q was identified in a third of BCC tumours studied. This is characteristic of inactivation of the PTCH tumour suppressor gene, a known attribute in some sporadic BCC development. Validation of this loss was performed via loss of heterozygosity, demonstrating good concordance with the CGH data. In addition the over-representation of the 6p chromosome arm was revealed in 47% of biopsies. This novel CNA is also commonly observed in other cutaneous neoplasias, including Merkel cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. This suggests a possible common mechanism in development and or promotion in these cutaneous dysplasias, the mechanisms of which have yet to be clearly defined. In contrast to BCC, numerical genetic aberrations in SCC and SK were much more frequent. Several regions of recurrent gain were commonly shared between both dysplasias including gain of 3q, 4p, 5p, 8q, 9q, 14q, 17p, 17q and 20q. Common chromosomal regions of loss included 3p, 8p, 9p, 11p, 13q and 17p. In addition loss of chromosome 18 was significantly observed in SCC in comparison to SK, a possible defining event in SK progression to SCC. The identification of shared genetic aberrations suggests a clonal and genetic relationship between the two lesions. This information further supports the notion for re-classification of SK to an SCC in situ or superficial SCC.  Finally, the CNAs detected have been similarly observed in other squamous cell-derived tumours, for example cervical and head and neck SCC. This provides further evidence to common mechanisms involved in the initiation, development and progression of SCC neoplasia. This study has identified a number of recurrent chromosomal regions, some of which are novel in NMSC development. The further delineation of these loci should provide additional evidence of their significance and degree of involvement in NMSC tumourigenesis. The identification of the cancer-causing genes mapped to these loci will further demarcate the genetic mechanisms of BCC and SCC progression. An understanding of the events involved in skin cancer formation and progression should shed additional light on molecular targets for diagnostics, management and therapeutic treatment.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-melanoma skin cancer</field><field name="subject">NMSC</field><field name="subject">basal cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">BCC</field><field name="subject">squamous cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">SCC</field><field name="subject">solar keratosis</field><field name="subject">SK</field><field name="subject">actinic keratosis</field><field name="subject">AK</field><field name="subject">comparative genomic hybridization</field><field name="subject">CGH</field><field name="subject">chromosomal abnormalities</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030818.122305</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electron Coincidence Studies of Molecules</field><field name="creator">Atkins, Danielle S</field><field name="description">The electron-electron coincidence (e,2e) technique yields complete kinematical information about the electron impact ionization process. The (e,2e) technique has been widely used to study dynamical effects in ionizing collisions with atomic targets, however studies of molecular ionization using this technique have been very limited. Recently further experimental studies of small molecules have been proposed, as the cross sections of small molecules are now computable using sophisticated theoretical approaches [77, 24]. This thesis presents dynamical investigations for the electron impact ionization of the molecular targets H2O and H2, employing the (e,2e) technique to experimentally measure the triple differential cross section (TDCS). The TDCS is defined as the probability that a bound electron will be ejected from the target atom or molecule (into a particular direction with a defined energy) and the initial electron will be scattered into a particular direction with a particular energy. All TDCSs presented within this thesis were performed using an electron coincidence spectrometer in the coplanar asymmetric geometry at intermediate incident electron energies.  This thesis presents the electron impact ionization TDCSs of H2O. A series of measurements were performed using H2O in the vapour form. Measurements of the TDCS are presented for the 2a1 atomic-like orbital and the 1b2, 3a1 and 1b1 molecular orbitals at a common incident electron energy of 250eV, ejected electron energy of 10eV and scattering angle of -15o. The experimental TDCSs are compared with theoretical cross sections that were calculated by Champion et al [25, 26] using a distorted wave Born approach (DWBA).  TDCS measurements for the single ionization of the hydrogen molecule, H2 were performed as in recent years there has been evidence that indicates the ejected electron angular distribution is perturbed due to Young-type interference effects. The oscillatory structure which is predicted in the cross section is due to the two-centred nature of the molecule [27, 29]. This thesis presents experimental TDCSs for the ionization of H2 which are compared to TDCSs of helium. A series of measurements for the TDCSs of H2 and He are presented at a common incident electron energy of 250eV and scattering angle of -15o, for a range of ejected electron energies between 10eV and 100eV.  The experimental TDCSs are compared with two types of theoretical calculations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular ionization</field><field name="subject">molecules</field><field name="subject">triple differential cross section (TDCS)</field><field name="subject">electron coincidence spectrometer</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070920.112918</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Children's Threat Perceptions in the Relationship Between Interparental Conflict and Child Adjustment</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Erin Renae</field><field name="description">This thesis integrated the cognitive-contextual model of Grych and Fincham (1990) and the emotional security framework of Davies and Cummings (1994; Cummings &amp; Davies, 1996) to investigate the role played by children's threat perceptions in the relationship between interparental conflict and child adjustment. Past research has emphasised the importance of children's appraisals of the threat posed by parent conflict for understanding links between interparental conflict and child outcomes. However, little is known about what it is that children actually find threatening about parent conflict, and what contributes to children's appraisals of threat in the context of parent conflict. In study 1, children (n = 236) aged 10 to 16 years were recruited to examine the relative contribution of four specific threat subtypes - fear of parent conflict escalating, fear of being drawn into parent conflict, fear of parent conflict resulting in family breakdown, and fear of parent conflict disrupting attachment relationships with parents - in explaining links between interparental conflict and child adjustment. Results showed that boys' fear of being drawn into parent conflict mediated the relationship between conflict severity and child internalising problems, while for girls it was a fear of parent conflict disrupting attachment relationships with parents that mediated this relationship. Threat was not found to mediate relationships between interparental conflict and child externalising problems. In study 2, families (n = 57) were recruited to investigate how aspects of parent conflict, and characteristics of the context in which the conflict occurs, shapes children's appraisals of the four specific threat subtypes in response to interparental conflict. The study adopted broader measures, including independent observations, of conflict, context, and child adjustment to further delineate the pathways linking interparental conflict, specific threat appraisals, and child adjustment. Results indicated that children perceived greater threat in the context of destructive parent conflict resolution behaviour, and lower threat in the context of positive family relationships (particularly the mother/child relationship). Specific aspects of conflict and context were differentially related to the four threat appraisals. Direct, gender-specific relationships were found between aspects of parent conflict resolution behaviour and family relationship security, and child outcomes. However, once these relationships were accounted for, specific threat perceptions were not found to predict child outcomes. Overall, the findings of this study suggested that positive parent/child relationships (in particular the mother/child relationship) modulated the stressfulness of parent conflict for children, making it more benign in terms of its impact on children's threat appraisals, and their longer-term adjustment in the context of conflict. Results of the thesis are discussed in terms of the importance of studying relationships between specific aspects of conflict, context, appraisals, and adjustment to further understand those situations in which children find interparental conflict stressful, and those in which they cope adaptively with interparental conflict.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parental conflict</field><field name="subject">Threat perception</field><field name="subject">Adjustment psychology</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Child</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050627.122034</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in Dendritic Scaffolds and Surface Functionalisation for Applications in Nanoscience</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Sarah Jane</field><field name="description">Chapter 1 includes a review on dendrimers, their synthesis and applications, with a particular focus on urea-linked dendritic species. The synthetic strategy utilised in this body of work was based on the preparation of a number of branched synthetic building blocks possessing differing terminal functionality. These branched dendrons, bearing three terminal residues and based on the cheap starting material tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) 23, involved the coupling of 3.3 equivalents of an appropriately para-substituted benzoic acid chloride with BOC protected TRIS 24 in DCM in the presence of triethylamine. The p-nitro, p-methoxy and p-methyl benzoyl chloride starting materials were obtained commercially, whilst N-(4-carboxyphenyl)maleimide was synthesised according to literature procedures. The BOC protected dendrons (25&#150;27, 34) were synthesized in yields ranging from 50&#150;92%. Deprotection of the BOC protected dendrons 25 and 26 in DCM with TFA, followed by the addition of 1M Na2CO3 afforded the TFA salts 35 and 36, respectively. The corresponding free base amines 37 and 38 were obtained on further treatment of the TFA salts with sodium carbonate. Deprotection of the BOC protected dendrons 27 and 34 afforded the free amines 39 and 48 directly after treatment with sodium carbonate. Synthesis of functionalised branched molecules containing 6- and 9-peripheral functionalities was achieved by refluxing 2 or 3 equivalents of the free amine dendrons with the bi- or tri- functional isocyanate cores, 15 and 45, in refluxing DCM, in most cases the products precipitated from the reaction mixture after 18 h and were isolated simply by filtration, otherwise the removal of the solvent from the reaction mixture afforded the spectroscopically pure product. Conversion of the peripheral nitro functionalised species 14 and 21 to the corresponding amines occurred smoothly via hydrogenation using 5% Pd/C under elevated temperature and pressure (DMF, 55 &#186;C, 600 psi) and afforded the polyamine 6-mer 51 in 92% yield and the 9-mer 50 in 90% yield, respectively. Similarly, conversion of the methoxy coated 9-mer 42, to the corresponding phenolic compound (AlBr3, dodecane thiol, DCM) afforded the 9-mer polyphenol 52 in an 87% yield. All compounds prepared were fully characterised and crystal structures were obtained for 26 and 35.  Chapter 2 includes a review on self-assembled monolayers of organosulfur compounds on gold, applications, patterning techniques and techniques for the characterisation of these surfaces. A number of surface monomers were successfully synthesized, to be used for various surface functionalisations, including the formation of an amine reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) disulfide 53, via the DCC coupling of 11,11&#146;-dithiobisundecanoic acid 54 with N-hydroxysuccinimide with an isolated yield of 30%. A novel protein-resistant monomer 58 was also synthesized from 11-undecanoic acid 55 via an acid chloride coupling with triethylene glycol monomethyl ether 58, and isolated in a 72% yield. A number of attempts were made to produce an acyl azide SAM monomer 59, with success finally achieved via the acid chloride coupling of 11,11&#146;-dithiobisundecanoic acid 54 with 5-amino-1,3-benzenedicarbonyl diazide 62 to produce 59 with an isolated yield of ~ 30%. Gold surfaces were prepared on atomically flat silicon wafers using an argon-ion sputterer. SAM films were formed on the gold surfaces via traditional solution based self-assembly methodology. A UV patterning protocol was developed, and a successful patterning trial using the NHS terminated monomer to backfill the UV exposed areas of a dodecane thiol monolayer was achieved and visualized using AFM and fluorescence microscopy after treating the surface with aminofluorescein. The covalent attachment of green fluorescent protein to the monolayer surface via reaction with the NHS terminated monolayer was demonstrated. The fluorescence of the biomolecule was preserved. The formation of a monolayer using the acyl azide monomer 59, was characterised by contact angle and XPS analysis. However, preliminary studies into the activation of the acyl azide surface into the reactive isocyanate were unsuccessful. There is however, significant scope for further investigations into this interesting surface technology.  Chapter 3 includes a review on heterobifunctional linker technology with a particular focus on amine and thiol reactive moieties and literature examples of heterobifunctional linkers of this type. Synthesis of heterobifunctional reagents such as 71 and 74 via a two step synthetic methodology involving the coupling of maleic anhydride with the parent amino-acids in acetic acid, followed by a one pot cyclisation and NHS esterification using DCC in DMF were successful, with overall yields of 9% and 32% respectively for the two reaction steps. The one pot extension of 74 with 6-aminohexanoic acid, followed by DCC, facilitated NHS esterification was achieved successfully in a yield of 30%. Attempts to extend 74 with the synthesised amino acid 88 were unsuccessful due to the insolubility of 88 in organic solvents. A different synthetic strategy was devised towards the synthesis of 85 with the coupling of 74 and mono BOC protected ethylene diamine 91 in DCM to give 93 in an isolated yield of 60%. Deprotection of the terminal amine was achieved via reaction with TFA in DCM however all attempts to prepare the free amine were unsuccessful. Subsequent attempts to couple 94 with both succinic anhydride and 92 were unsuccessful. A maleimide functionalized crown ether was synthesised as a molecule for protein modification via the reaction of 74 with 4&#146;-aminobenzo-15-crown-5 97 to produce 98 in an 80% yield. All compounds were fully characterised with crystal structures obtained for 74, 79 and 89.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dendritic Scaffolds</field><field name="subject">Surface Functionalisation</field><field name="subject">Nanoscience</field><field name="subject">Dendrimers</field><field name="subject">Organosulfur</field><field name="subject">Gold</field><field name="subject">Heterobifunctional</field><field name="subject">Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Synthetic</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071122.124705</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytic Model Derivation Of Microfluidic Flow For MEMS Virtual-Reality CAD</field><field name="creator">Aumeerally, Manisah</field><field name="description">This thesis derives a first approximation model that will describe the flow of fluid in microfluidic devices such as in microchannels, microdiffusers and micronozzles using electrical network modelling.  The important parameter that is of concern is the flow rates of these devices.  The purpose of this work is to contribute to the physical component of our interactive Virtual Reality (VR)-prototyping tool for MEMS, with emphasis on fast calculations for interactive CAD design. Current calculations are too time consuming and not suitable for interactive CAD with dynamic animations.  This work contributes to and fills the need for the development of MEMS dynamic visualisation, showing the movement of fluid within microdevices in time scale. Microfluidic MEMS devices are used in a wide range of applications, such as in chemical analysis, gene expression analysis, electronic cooling system and inkjet printers.  Their success lies in their microdimensions, enabling the creation of systems that are considerably minute yet can contain many complex subsystems.  With this reduction in size, the advantages of requiring less material for analysis, less power consumption, less wastage and an increase in portability becomes their selling point.  Market size is in excess of US$50 billion in 2004, according to a study made by Nexus.  New applications are constantly being developed leading to creation of new devices, such as the DNA and the protein chip.  Applications are found in pharmaceuticals, diagnostic, biotechnology and the food industry.  An example is the outcome of the mapping and sequencing of the human genome DNA in the late 1990's leading to greater understanding of our genetic makeup.  Armed with this knowledge, doctors will be able to treat diseases that were deemed untreatable before, such as diabetes or cancer.  Among the tools with which that can be achieved include the DNA chip which is used to analyse an individual's genetic makeup and the Gene chip used in the study of cancer. With this burgeoning influx of new devices and an increase in demand for them there is a need for better and more efficient designs.  The MEMS design process is time consuming and costly.  Many calculations rely on Finite Element Analysis, which has slow and time consuming algorithms, that make interactive CAD unworkable. This is because the iterative algorithms for calculating the  animated images showing the ongoing proccess as they occur, are too slow. Faster computers do not solve the void of efficient algorithms, because with faster computer also comes the demand for a fasters response. A 40 - 90 minute FEA calculation will not be replaced by a faster computer in the next decades to an almost instant response. Efficient design tools are required to shorten this process.  These interactive CAD tools need to be able to give quick yet accurate results.  Current CAD tools involve time consuming numerical analysis technique which requires hours of numerous iterations for the device structure design followed by more calculations to achieve the required output specification.  Although there is a need for a detailed analysis, especially in solving for a particular aspect of the design, having a tool to quickly get a first approximation will greatly shorten the guesswork involved in determining the overall requirement. The underlying theory for the fluid flow model is based on traditional continuum theory and the Navier-Stokes equation is used in the derivation of a layered flow model in which the flow region is segmented into layered sections, each having different flow rates.  The flow characteristics of each sections are modeled as electrical components in an electrical circuit.  Matlab 6.5 (MatlabTM) is used for the modelling aspect and Simulink  is used for the simulation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microfluidic devices</field><field name="subject">virtual reality prototyping tool</field><field name="subject">MEMS</field><field name="subject">CAD</field><field name="subject">finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">Navier-Stokes equation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061106.095352</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene Expression Profiling of Cylindrospermopsin Toxicity.</field><field name="creator">Bain, Peter A</field><field name="description">Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is a toxic alkaloid produced by several freshwater cyanobacterial species, the most prevalent in Australian waters being Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. The occurrence of CYN-producing cyanobacteria in drinking water sources worldwide poses a potential human health risk, with one well-documented case of human poisoning attributed to the toxin. While extensive characterisation of CYN-induced toxicity has been conducted in rodents both in vivo and in primary cell cultures, little is known about mechanisms of toxicity in human cell types. This thesis describes studies undertaken to further define the molecular mechanisms of CYN toxicity in human cells. Concentration-response relationships were determined in various cultured human cell types using standard toxicity assays. As expected, CYN caused dose-dependent decreases in the growth of three cell lines, HepG2, Caco-2 and HeLa, and one primary cell type, human dermal fibroblasts, according to tetrazolium reduction assays. CYN treatment did not disrupt cellular membranes according to the lactate dehydrogenase release assay in HepG2 or Caco-2 cells after 24, 48 or 72 h exposure, but did cause membrane disruption in fibroblasts after 72 h exposure to relatively high concentrations of the toxin. Apoptosis occurred more readily in HeLa cells than HepG2 cells or fibroblasts, with 72 h exposure to 1 &amp;mug/mL required before statistically significant rates of apoptosis occurred in the latter cell types. CYN did not appear to directly affect the structure of actin filaments or microtubules under the conditions used in the present study. The major portion of the work presented in this thesis comprises a large-scale interrogation of changes in gene expression induced by the toxin in cultured cells. To assess the effects of CYN on global gene expression, relative messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in human dermal fibroblasts and HepG2 cells after 6 h and 24 h exposure to 1 &amp;mug/mL CYN were determined using oligonucleotide microarrays representing approximately 19 000 genes. Overall, the number of transcripts significantly altered in abundance was greater in fibroblasts than in HepG2 cells. In both cell types, mRNA levels for genes related to amino acid biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and protein folding and transport were reduced after CYN treatment, while transcripts representing genes for apoptosis, RNA biosynthesis and RNA processing increased in abundance. More detailed data analyses revealed the modulation of a number of stress response pathways&#8212;genes regulated by NF-&amp;kappaB were induced, DNA damage response pathways were up-regulated, and a large number of genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress were strongly down-regulated. Genes for the synthesis and processing of mRNA, tRNA and rRNA were strongly up-regulated, indicating that CYN treatment may increase the turnover of all forms of cellular RNA. A small group of genes were differentially expressed in HepG2 cells and fibroblasts, revealing cell-specific responses to the toxin. Selected changes in transcript level were validated using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). The modulation of stress response pathways by CYN, indicated by microarray analysis, was further investigated using other methods. The role of tumour suppressor protein p53 in CYN-mediated gene expression was confirmed by measuring the expression of known p53-regulated genes following CYN treatment of HepG2 cells and human dermal fibroblasts using qRT-PCR. Western blotting of protein extracts from CYNtreated cells showed that p53 protein accumulation occurred in HepG2 cells, providing additional evidence of the activation of the p53 pathway by CYN in this cell line. The immediate-early genes JUN and FOS were found to be induced by CYN in a concentration-dependent manner, and MYC was induced to a lesser extent. The mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, implicated in the ribotoxic stress response initiated by damage to ribosomal RNA, appeared to become phosphorylated in HeLa cells after CYN exposure, suggesting that ribotoxic stress may occur in response to CYN in at least some cell types. The expression of a reporter gene under the control of a response element specific for NF-&amp;kappaB was induced at the mRNA level but inhibited at the protein level. This shows that while transcription factors such as p53 and NF-&amp;kappaB are apparently activated in response to the toxin, transactivation of target genes may not necessarily manifest a corresponding increase at the protein level. The current work contributes significantly to the current understanding of cylindrospermopsin toxicity in human-derived cell types, and provides further insight into putative modes of action.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cylindrospermopsin</field><field name="subject">CYN</field><field name="subject">gene expression profiling</field><field name="subject">Cylindrospermopsin toxicity</field><field name="subject">cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">human health risk</field><field name="subject">human cell types</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">human dermal fibroblasts</field><field name="subject">stress response pathways</field><field name="subject">cellular RNA</field><field name="subject">HepG2 cells</field><field name="subject">p53-regulated genes</field><field name="subject">NF-kB-mediated gene expression</field><field name="subject">apoptosis</field><field name="subject">necrosis</field><field name="subject">DNA damage</field><field name="subject">Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii</field><field name="subject">toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20080404.145834</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolving Algorithms for Over-Constrained and Satisfaction Problems</field><field name="creator">Bain, Stuart</field><field name="description">The notion that a universally effective problem solver may still exist, and is simply waiting to be found, is slowly being abandoned in the light of a growing body of work reporting on the narrow applicability of individual heuristics. As the formalism of the constraint satisfaction problem remains a popular choice for the representation of problems to be solved algorithmically, there exists an ongoing need for new algorithms to effciently handle the disparate range of problems that have been posed in this representation. Given the costs associated with manually applying human algorithm development and problem solving expertise, methods that can automatically adapt to the particular features of a specific class of problem have begun to attract more attention. Whilst a number of authors have developed adaptive systems, the field, and particularly with respect to their application to constraint satisfaction problems, has seen only limited discussion as to what features are desirable for an adaptive constraint system. This may well have been a limiting factor with previous implementations, which have exhibited only subsets of the five features identified in this work as important to the utility of an adaptive constraint satisfaction system. Whether an adaptive system exhibits these features depends on both the chosen represen-tation and the method of adaptation. In this thesis, a three-part representation for constraint algorithms is introduced, which defines an algorithm in terms of contention, preference and selection functions. An adaptive system based on genetic programming is presented that adapts constraint algorithms described using the mentioned three-part representation. This is believed to be the first use of standard genetic programming for learning constraint algo-rithms. Finally, to further demonstrate the efficacy of this adaptive system, its performance in learning specialised algorithms for hard, real-world problem instances is thoroughly evaluated. These instances include random as well as structured instances from known-hard benchmark distributions, industrial problems (specifically, SAT-translated planning and cryptographic problems) as well as over-constrained problem instances. The outcome of this evaluation is a set of new algorithms - valuable in their own right - specifically tailored to these problem classes.

This methodology is tested in close readings of three relatively contemporary Australian literary texts: David Malouf's short story "A Traveller's Tale" (1986) and novella Remembering Babylon (1994), and Peter Carey's short story "The Chance" (1978). Unprincipled formalism is developed in relation to three broad contexts: the fragmented state of the contemporary discipline of literary studies; the complex of international economic and social phenomena which goes under the general rubric of globalisation; and the specific Australian left-liberal literary critical tradition which I have termed, for convenience sake, the Meanjin literary formation. Unprincipled formalism does not draw a distinction between form and content.  Unprincipled formalism is a critical methodology that is both avowedly socially concerned and strictly formalist.  It is concerned with articulating and analysing the particular social and political interventions made by literary texts (as well as the resultant critical discussion of those texts) through a consideration of the formal techniques by which literary texts situate themselves as acts of communication.  Principal among these techniques is the mise en abyme.   The thesis provides a detailed analysis of debates around the mise en abyme informed by the work of theorists such as Ross Chambers, Lucien Dallenbach, Frank Lentricchia, Moshe Ron, Jacques Derrida and others.   Politically, unprincipled formalism attempts to steer a middling course between neo-liberal triumphalism on the one hand and nostalgic left romanticism on the other.  This involves on the one hand a critique of neo-liberalism drawing on the work of Charles Taylor, Stephen Holmes, John Frow and others, and on the other a critique of a nostalgic romantic tendency in "progressive" critical technologies such as postmodern and postcolonial literary studies.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">David Malouf</field><field name="subject">Peter Carey</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian fiction</field><field name="subject">Australian literature</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">critical method</field><field name="subject">critical methodology</field><field name="subject">literary criticism</field><field name="subject">form</field><field name="subject">formal</field><field name="subject">formalism</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">globalization</field><field name="subject">Meanjin</field><field name="subject">mise en abyme</field><field name="subject">Left</field><field name="subject">Left-Liberal</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040616.120642</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lost in Translation: A History of Moral Rights in Australian Law</field><field name="creator">Banks, Catherine</field><field name="description">This thesis is a history of moral rights in Australian law. It traces the historical discourse about moral rights in Australian law and demonstrates how that discourse has shaped the meaning moral rights have come to assume in their current form under the current regime contained in the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rijghts) Act 2000. This history examines the reception and later production of a moral rights discourse in Australian law, and reveals that the historical discourse about Australian moral rights was dominated by the three themes; foreignness, international obligation and economic impact. I contend these three themes fundamentally shaped moral rights as they now appear in the moral rights regime. As the history unfolds, it will become clear that the moral rights regime was organised around a specific repertoire of arguments and imaginings, and it is this discourse that informs this thesis. My argument is pursued in three stages. Section One of the thesis provides the historical detail of the moral rights trajectory in Australian jurisprudence, and reveals, within that history, the emergence of three dominant themes, which are pursued in subsequent detail. In addition to the history, this section also provides detailed discussion of the legislative provisions in order to illustrate moral rights as a product of the history, and it highlights some of the shortcomings of the regime and provides some background for the case study in Section Two. Section Two of the thesis interrogates the structure of the moral rights regime by applying the Act's provisions to the case study of indigenous creators, thus providing a contemporary example of how these rights may work in practice, as the result of the historical discourse. Thus this section sets the scene for final part of the thesis, which delves further into the historical discourse. Section Part Three follows the themes of the moral rights debate as they emerged historically. Reconceptualizing the moral rights discourse in this way helps to explain why the debates about moral rights took a particular course and produced the outcomes it did. The starting point for these discussions is a detailed examination of the themes of foreignness, international obligation and economic impact, and follows these themes as they evolved chronologically. In particular, the discussion reveals that the debates about moral rights effectively fall into two eras. The first era (1928-1988) centred around the question of whether Australia should introduce moral rights and the debates about the appropriateness of the reception. At the commencement of the second era (1988-2000) the question shifted to what form moral rights should take. This then provides a backdrop with which to understand why specific discussions about moral rights were sidelined during the years of debates leading up to the legislation; in particular, the subject and the object; which form the fulcrum of a moral rights action. This is an essential part of the history because it explains why the subject and the object came to be imagined and constructed in such a narrow and limited way and clarifies why the moral rights provisions appear manifestly ineffective, particularly for indigenous creators and their communities. This thesis contributes to legal history in three important ways. First, it provides a detailed account of a discourse about moral rights in Australian law, and in doing so challenges the long held assumptions about their reception and production. Second, it highlights the importance of history to legal discourse. Just as regulatory regimes, institutions, and rules are integral to the law, so too are the informal practices, discourses and contexts on which they were based. Third, it reminds the reader that history is a signpost, and this history of moral rights demonstrates that the way this law was derived, imagined and constructed has significance for the social, cultural and legal context in which that process takes place.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian law</field><field name="subject">moral rights in law</field><field name="subject">Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Act</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061006.114720</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstructive Strategies for Artists Engaging With ecology: An Examination of the Relationship Between Culture, Nature and Technology in Ecological Art</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Katherine Rachel</field><field name="description">With the rise in industrial capitalism during the 20th Century, artists increasingly focused on the threat of a disappearing natural world. In the high technology era of the late 20th Century, artists whose practice is termed 'ecological' based their work around new understandings of the relationship between nature and culture, fundamentally underpinned by a shift toward evolutionary, systems-theoretical perspectives from those of conquest and exploitation. Now, at the dawn of the 21st Century, the information era has brought into intersection the discourses of information technologies, quantum physics, and biological science, awakening artists to the challenge of engaging with ecology as the primary subject of their practice. The doctoral project that is the subject of this exegesis focuses critical attention on our scientific and aesthetic understandings of water - a crucial symbolic element of global import in survival. It explores the representation of water in and through art practice that is informed by political ecological awareness and new (digital) technologies. My practice exploits the potential of recent digital technologies to create experiences that aim to encourage a more ecologically sustainable human engagement with nature through this focus on water. This exegesis describes and locates the creative work within an ongoing discourse in contemporary culture that actively seeks to re-establish and redefine the relationship between culture and nature.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecology in art</field><field name="subject">aesthetic understanding of water</field><field name="subject">ecologically sustainable human engagement</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061011.150154</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathways to Detention</field><field name="creator">Barrett, Susan</field><field name="description">This research utilised a range of deterministic and stochastic analyses to establish whether Queensland's juvenile justice system processes Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal young male offenders differently. The impetus for this research stemmed from the continued high rates of Aboriginal over-representation within Australia's criminal justice system, despite diversionary measures to reduce such over-representation, and a commitment by the Queensland Government to reduce by 50% the number of Aboriginal peoples in custody by the year 2011. There are two competing hypotheses concerning the cause of this over-representation, (i) external factors such as socioeconomic disadvantage, unemployment or substance abuse, or (ii) systemic disparity within the criminal justice system. For this research, disparity is defined as the unacceptable use of discrimination; discrimination can be appropriate if it is used to define or enhance a situation, such as discriminating between offenders who are recidivists and those who are first time offenders. The inappropriate use of discrimination occurs for example, when harsher sentences are issued to offenders based on non-legal factors such as race or gender. Systemic disparity is therefore used here to represent the inappropriate use of discrimination against an offender by the criminal justice system.  The second hypothesis, one of systemic disparity, provided the framework for this research, which posed the following primary question: Is there quantifiable evidence to support the existence of disparity acting against young male Aboriginal offenders within Queensland's juvenile justice system? Two separate but complementary studies were designed to address this issue: the pathways study and the trajectory study.  The pathways study utilised 20,648 finalised appearances for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal young male offenders in Queensland's juvenile courts, during 1999 to 2003.  Three custodial decision-making stages (police custody, remand, and sentencing) were examined and two questions initially posed: Does the custodial decision made at one stage of the juvenile justice system impact on a subsequent custodial decision-making stage? Does criminal history, Aboriginal status, offence type or an interaction of these factors significantly influence the probability of (i) detention in police custody (ii) court remand (iii) a custodial order at sentencing? It was recognised that other legally relevant factors such as family structure and stability, school attendance and community ties might also influence these custodial decisions; however, for the purposes of this research it was not possible to include these variables in the analyses.  Controlling for criminal history, findings from logistic regression analyses indicated that being detained in police custody increased the odds of being remanded into custody, and being remanded into custody increased the odds of a custodial order. Whilst Aboriginal status was not a consistent factor at any of these three custodial stages, there was clear evidence of disparity acting against the young male Aboriginal offender, particularly early in their criminal career.  To examine these disparities further, these three custodial stages were modeled as eight processing pathways: four of which resulted in a custodial order and four in a  noncustodial order. Using this processing model, a third question was posed: Do young Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal male offenders have different custodial pathways? Findings indicated that Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal young male offenders were in general, processed along similar custodial pathways that did not include police custody, remand or a custodial order. However, young male Aboriginal offenders were less likely than equivalent non-Aboriginal offenders to have been processed along this pathway and more likely to be processed along the pathways that included remand. It was found that young offenders with a chronic criminal history were more likely to be processed along these remand pathways, and Aboriginal offenders were more likely to have a chronic criminal history than non-Aboriginal offenders; there was clear evidence of disparity at specific custodial stages of the system. In addition, as young male Aboriginal offenders progressed deeper into the system there was evidence of cumulative disparity, particularly along the remand pathways, meaning that the probability of being in custody increases as the offender progresses from one custodial stage to the next custodial stage.  Given the existence of disparity, acting within the juvenile justice system and against the young male Aboriginal offender, it was important to formulate viable solutions to such disparity, particularly in light of the Queensland government's commitment to reduce Aboriginal offenders in custody by 50%. Deterministic analyses and computer simulations were used to test the viability of various reduction scenarios suggested by the data. Despite in some instances, different results from the deterministic analyses and the computer simulations, overall findings indicated that to reduce custodial disparity whether at the remand stage, the custodial order stage, or in custody overall (the summation of police custody, remand and custodial orders) that reducing remand, regardless of whether the young offender had been in police custody or not, was the best overall solution.  The trajectory study built on the findings of the pathways study, which had identified criminal history as an important factor in the processing pathways of young male Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal offenders. Using the semi-parametric group based method, the criminal trajectories of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal young male offenders in Queensland were modeled. These trajectories were based on the finalised appearances of two cohorts of young offenders aged 10 to 17 years of age: those born in 1983 and 1984 and who had turned 18 years of age in 2001 and 2002 respectively.  All of these young male offenders had entered the adult system when they turned 17 years of age, and this data provided their complete juvenile history in Queensland. Prior analyses using this method had not considered Aboriginal status or race as a determining factor in these trajectory models, nor had these models been validated either internally or externally in published works. For this research, internal validity was considered as the correct classification of offenders into trajectory groups, and external validity as the ability to reproduce these results in a second or subsequent sample of juvenile offenders.  Two questions were therefore posed in the trajectory study: Do young Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal male offenders have different criminal trajectories? Can the predicted model(s) be validated, both internally and externally? Initial findings indicated that the optimal trajectory models selected on prior knowledge and the Bayesian Information Criterion did not validate internally. This finding brought into question the trajectory results of other published works that had not internally validated their models. The models finally selected as optimal indicated that Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal young male offenders did not have a common criminal trajectory and could not be modeled as one population. Both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal young offenders were modeled by a low-frequency group, a late-onset group, and a chronic trajectory group. However, the young male Aboriginal offender was more likely than the non-Aboriginal to have been in the chronic or the late onset group and less likely to have been in the lowfrequency group.  External validation utilised an innovative but simple method that utilised all of the data in the modeling process along with a sample of this same data for validation purposes: 10% of the criminal profiles, which were characteristic of the trajectory groups, and a further 5% of randomly selected profiles were chosen for validation. All of the characteristic profiles, but only 50% of the randomly selected profiles were validated, and of the latter, the majority not validated was in the late-onset group. In total, 79.2% of the Aboriginal trajectories and 85.6% of the non-Aboriginal criminal trajectories were correctly externally validated.  Overall, there are two important implications from this research for government. First, even though young male Aboriginal offenders are more likely to have a chronic criminal history than non-Aboriginal offenders, this factor does not account for all of the observed disparity acting against the young Aboriginal offender within Queensland's juvenile justice system: there is evidence of disparity within the system that is unaccounted for by either offence type or criminal history. Second, given this chronic criminal history, systemic solutions to systemic disparity whilst viable, will not ultimately resolve this problem: they are only short-term measures at the end of a very long justice system. Longer-term solutions are needed to address external factors such as socio-economic disadvantage, unemployment and substance abuse in Aboriginal communities, before these young people are exposed to the system. Continuing to concentrate on systemic solutions, to such an entrenched problem as Aboriginal overrepresentation and disparity, is a misdirection of system resources and is inconsistent with social justice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Detention</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">juvenile justice system</field><field name="subject">criminal justice system</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">non-Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">young male offenders</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070824.112806</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boys and Literacy: Rhetoric and Reality</field><field name="creator">Barron, Susan</field><field name="description">The gendered features of children's development in early literacy, particularly those that contribute to the generally poorer performance of boys, were explored in a dual-phase questionnaire study, conducted across schools in South East Queensland. The potential influences of school type (private and state) and gender-composition of a class (mixed-gender and single-gender schools) on performances of boys were tested on two state-wide tests (The Year 2 Diagnostic Net for Reading; The Reading Development Continuum) and a standardised measure (The St Lucia Reading Comprehension Test). Children and parents were surveyed to determine the locus of significant differences between girls and boys in relation to attitudes to reading, being read to and to constructs of self and others as readers. Girls presented as more positive across these measures. They indicated greater interest in reading and being read to. They reported reading across a wider range of genres for both school and recreational purposes and selected reading as a preferred activity in comparison with others. Boys were more reluctant readers. They displayed poorer attitudes generally and reported reading less in quantity and frequency in both school and home settings. The notion of girls and boys maintaining a positive or negative "image" emerged from a small but influential subset. This derivation was consistent with perceptions of gender-bias in gender-preferences. The profile of achievement across the three measures yielded a story of difference. Boys in private school settings were significantly less likely than girls to obtain higher Continuum scores and boys in state school settings were less likely than girls to be rated as proficient in the Year Two Net Test. Boys from private schools and in single-gender situations outperformed all other subgroups on the Net. Yet, they obtained the worst result on the Continuum, and were in the middle rank on the standardised test. Whether in private or state schools, boys were likely to obtain lower average Continuum scores than females. This was a statistically significant difference in the private school sector. While boys in Private Schools were slightly more likely than girls to be rated as proficient in the Year Two Net test, boys in state schools were far less likely than girls to be rated as proficient on the Year Two Net test, a statistically significant difference. Children attending single-gender, private schools attained higher aggregate scores on the attitude subtests of the Continuum than their state school counterparts. However, children in comparable, mixed-gender, private schools performed neither better nor worse than their peers in single-gender private schools. This comparison does not support contentions that single-gender schooling is superior in relation to the literacy achievements of emergent readers. When comparisons were made at the most general level (male vs. female, private vs. state school) gender did not predict scores in the externally administered St. Lucia Reading Comprehension Test scores. The significant relationship for girls at state schools on the Net test and for girls at private schools on the Continuum (both internally-based measures), coupled with the non-significant differences in relation to the St. Lucia Reading Comprehension Test points to the possibility that internally-based ratings are to some extent driven by teacher perceptions of literacy competence, and such perceptions may at times be unreliable. The corollary observation that not only was the measurement of attitude provided by the Continuum Attitude score significantly correlated with the St. Lucia reading test but also that the latter was not directly influenced by gender affirmed the notion that a school culture of gendered literacy is influencing teacher attitudes related to the achievement of literacy. What analyses of home background capture is the surprisingly lack of any connection between these tacitly understood underpinnings of literacy and the achievement thereof. The lack particularly of any connection between the teacher reading to students and the achievement of literacy was also surprising. In relation to literacy practice, the three most highly identified male activities (kicking a ball, computer games, playing outside) grouped to form a distinct factor (subscale) and this factor score was positively associated at a statistically significant level with scores on the St Lucia Reading test. Not only did private school children obtain better scores on the St. Lucia test, it was private school students whose identification of this highly stereotypically set of male activities linked significantly with an external measure of the achievement of literacy. This linkage seems indicative of an enhanced ability to read social codes more generally and is probably reflective of the social space occupied by private school students. In sum, while students, parents, and teachers fairly consistently displayed a heavily gendered culture with regard to literacy, actual achievement levels, attitudes, home background, and literacy practice disconnected from that gendered culture. That is, there appears to be a subtle but important distinction between perception and reality in relation to the achievement of literacy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">boys</field><field name="subject">academic achievement</field><field name="subject">academic performance</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">reading</field><field name="subject">girls</field><field name="subject">gender differences</field><field name="subject">child development</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">reading ability</field><field name="subject">tests</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040623.140850</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Job Change and Job Insecurity in the Police Service: Applying the Cognitive-Motivational-Relational Theory of Emotion</field><field name="creator">Bartrum, Dee A</field><field name="description">This thesis tested an appraisal, coping and adaptation model of job insecurity and organisational change with a sample of police officers. The model integrated key aspects of Lazarus' (1991a, 1999) cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion (personal coping resources, appraisal questions, emotion, coping and adaptation outcomes) with the ten job characteristics (opportunity for control, opportunity for skill use, externally generated goals, variety, environmental clarity, availability of money, physical security, opportunity for interpersonal contact, valued social position and supportive supervision) from Warr's (1987, 1999) vitamin model. The ten job characteristics were viewed as valued aspects of the environment that may potentially be lost or threatened during organisational crisis or change. The service within which the police officers worked underwent a large scale organisational restructuring from late 2001 to July 2002. Three research studies were conducted for this thesis. The first study developed a psychometrically sound, 40-item job characteristics scale, based on the ten dimensions of Warr's vitamin model. This scale assessed participants' worries about changes to aspects in their work environment. The development of this scale met a need within the job insecurity literature for a theoretically-derived measure of valued job features, and enabled the investigation of the appraisal, coping and adaptation model. This measure was included in the questionnaire for the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that formed the second and third major research projects of this thesis. The main aim of the second study was to test a proposed model of appraisal, emotion, coping and adaptation following the experience of organisational change. The model proposed that person variables and personal coping resources (e.g., personal control and coping self-efficacy) would have indirect associations with the adaptational outcomes of Psychological Distress, Life Satisfaction and Job Withdrawal Behaviour. The personal coping resources were proposed to have indirect relationships with coping strategies through job characteristics, appraisal and emotion as well as direct associations with levels of distress, Life Satisfaction and Job Withdrawal Behaviour. The ten job characteristics were expected to have a direct relationship with Psychological Distress, and indirect associations with the three adaptational outcomes through appraisal, emotion and coping. Primary and secondary appraisal was proposed to precede and directly influence emotion. In turn, emotions were expected to directly relate to the coping strategies that were used, with coping strategies mediating the association between emotion and the three adaptational outcomes. An additional focus of this study was to determine whether there were mean differences for males and females on the variables examined. The second study was conducted in November 2002, three months after the restructuring. Two thousand two hundred and eighteen police officers were invited to participate in the study, with a total sample of 303 police officers responding. The antecedent variables (personal resources, job characteristics, perception of global job insecurity, appraisal components, feelings, coping strategies) and the indicators of employee adjustment (Psychological Distress, Life Satisfaction and Job Withdrawal Behaviour) were collected via a self-report questionnaire. Collateral data were also obtained from a friend, spouse/partner or work colleague of the police officer for the dependent variables of Psychological Distress and Life Satisfaction. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were applied to investigate the aims of this study. Some support for a partial mediating model was obtained, mainly with the work specific adaptational outcomes of Psychological Distress and Job Withdrawal Behaviour. The antecedent variables in the model explained a substantial amount of variance for each of the adaptation outcomes. Notably, the antecedents of the model to uniquely account for variance in Life Satisfaction, a non-work contextual outcome, were person variables and personal coping resources. The third research study used a two-wave longitudinal panel design. The principle aim of this study was to test the proposed model of appraisal, coping and adaptation, longitudinally. Specifically, the aim was to examine whether initial levels, and changes in levels over time in aspects of the proposed model predicted later levels, and changes across time in the adaptational outcomes of Psychological Distress, Life Satisfaction and Job Withdrawal Behaviour. The study was conducted in April and May, four to five months after the T1 data had been collected, and seven months after the restructuring. A total of 158 police officers responded from the 303 that participated in Study 2. Difference scores were calculated to examine change across time within hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Three longitudinal regression models (Basic, Change-in-Outcome and Change/Change) were examined to test for robust effects. The model explained considerably more variance in Psychological Distress across all three longitudinal models tested, compared to Life Satisfaction and Job Withdrawal Behaviour. Generally the work related antecedents (T1) had no or minimal association with change in Life Satisfaction. However, change in physical safety was associated with change in Life Satisfaction across the two points in time. Some robust associations were found for emotion coping strategies with Psychological Distress; personal control with Life Satisfaction; and negative feelings with Job Withdrawal Behaviour. The findings from the three studies are discussed with reference to Lazarus' (1991a, 1999) cognitive-motivational-relational theory and Warr's (1987, 1999) vitamin model. The findings from the cross-sectional and longitudinal research studies support partial mediating relationships among the antecedents with the adaptational outcomes. There is debate within the job insecurity literature as to whether potential loss of job features should be included in the definition and operationalisation of this construct. Based on the results of the research, it is recommended that the definition and operationalisation of job insecurity include potential loss of job features and potential loss of the job. The model tested accounted for more variance in the work specific outcomes of Psychological Distress and Job Withdrawal Behaviour than Life Satisfaction. Thus, the organisational restructuring appeared to have a greater association with work-specific outcomes rather than non-work outcomes. Some limitations of the research are noted. For example, the small sample size limited the ability to use latent variable model testing procedures. Second, the conclusions from the research studies are applicable to a police service organisation and thus may be limited in their application to employees in other organisations. Third, the model focused quite heavily on the individual within the organisation, examining personal resources and characteristics. Nonetheless, this research has contributed to the literature in several ways by: (a) developing a theoretically founded measure of valued job characteristics, (b) demonstrating the importance of evaluating changes to these features of the work environment and the potential loss of the job during organisational instability, and (c) testing an appraisal, coping and adaptation model that shows much promise for use within organisations undergoing crisis or change. This newly developed and tested model appears especially useful in understanding the impact of organisation changes on work related outcomes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Police Service</field><field name="subject">job security</field><field name="subject">organisational change</field><field name="subject">cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion</field><field name="subject">work environment</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070219.115614</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing the Dynamics of a Textually Mediated Community of Practice: The Social Construction of Literacy in the Business Faculty</field><field name="creator">Baskin, Colin</field><field name="description">This study is positioned within existing debates about the meaning and role of academic literacy, how it shapes and then frames the academic and professional writing practices of business students. It explores relationships between literacy, individual writers and the academy. It goes beyond merely locating these relationships, pointing more to the need to understand how particular student and staff groups within the faculty describe academic writing practices, and in turn act upon these descriptions. Current formulations of academic literacy reflect a heavy emphasis by academic and professional communities on the commodity value of 'literacy skills'. This happens despite the fact that not much is known about the details and current culture of literacy practices in Australian universities, and how these are inflected by different disciplinary areas and cross-cultural factors. Given the divergent applications of literacy that exist across the business professions, there remains a distinct lack of consensus over the meaning of literacy in business higher education communities. Institutional responses reflect this lack of consensus, and are expressed as inflections around a perceived 'crisis' in tertiary literacy standards. Business and professional faculties, while simultaneously embracing the economic and policy imperative underlying mass education, are seen to remain scornful of the service obligation this brings. Implicit in current understandings of academic literacy are the taken for granted connections between basic literacy, reading and writing, schooling, education and employment. These connections underwrite the relations of institutional arrangements, everyday practices, policy construction, and the conditions for student evaluation in the faculty. This study begins from where literacy is located 'bodily', and provides in the first instance a content analysis which explicates and presents student discussions on various ways of thinking about, framing and reframing academic writing. The project then turns to contemporary literacy theory for an explanation of how a community discourse of 'academic literacy' is conceived, produced and in turn reproduced. Contemporary literacy theory has embraced three theoretical frameworks in its move away from a traditional uni-dimensional view of literacy, namely critical social theories, discourse and textual studies, and ethnographic research methodologies (Smith 1988). This trinity of frameworks is used in the second instance to examine a series of interviews with student writers. This data makes visible the means by which institutions value certain literacy practices over others, practices which support the naturalized world of writing required by the faculty and its professional communities. Dominant literacy practices are identified, and interpretive procedures from the field of Ethnomethodology are used to account for the ways in which discourses on academic writing both reflect and produce social and community realities. Theories of discourse are used to examine the social construction of student writing practices within this local faculty community by identifying the attributes and assumptions that are attached to different community members to account for aspects of writing practice. The key to understanding academic literacy practices is found in explication of the social processes and practices that organise the 'everyday' world of the business faculty. This project discloses how the subjective world of academic literacy is organised, and how this form of organisation is articulated 'to the social relations of the larger social and economic process' (Smith 1988:152).  In the strict context of this study, this means being able to disclose for certain groups of student writers, how their situations and literacy practices are organised and determined by social processes outside the scope of their 'everyday' world. This process of discovery requires the researched to actively construct 'local' referents as categories and concepts which, when applied to a faculty context, can form an observable, local practice as a dialectic 'between what members do in tending the categories and concepts of (an) institutional ideology' on academic writing (Smith 1988:161).  The interpretive practices students use to analyse literacy practices bring academic literacy into being. The outcomes of the study show that the relationships between literacy, the individual and the academy are currently explained and understood in terms of the connections that can be made between existing professional and academic community discourses. Here the concept of a 'literacy crisis' resides. It is expressed through informant talk as a perceived fall in academic literacy standards. Informant debate on what has caused this decline is generally expressed through two key positions. One of these holds a rhetorical view of literacy as a somewhat natural and procedural outcome of the higher educational process, positioning literacy within an oppositional framework of deficit cultural and linguistic models. A second view evokes a competitive agenda of limited and limiting academic and professional opportunities. Behind these arguments and their rebuttals, lie assumptions about the 'literate' person as a member of the faculty. In arguing that research into the field of academic literacy has concealed a student sub-text, this study argues that literacy has been constructed, implemented and investigated from the perspective of the institution. It follows that academic literacy can be better understood as a socially constructed and signifying space, one which includes opportunities for students to create their own powerful identities as writers and as members of professional and faculty communities. This project bridges many aspects of student experience, with the major focus upon that which has been excluded by the absence of students from the making of the topics and the relevance of the discourse. For this compelling reason, this project has direct relevance to teachers, researchers, fieldworkers and policy-makers involved in the overlapping fields of literacy and higher education.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tertiary literacy</field><field name="subject">academic literacy</field><field name="subject">discourse and textual studies</field><field name="subject">critical social theory</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20021219.151517</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Just Practice? Towards a Theory of Professional Education That Uses the Workplace as Context</field><field name="creator">Bates, Merrelyn</field><field name="description">Universities are becoming more accountable for their own funding and for establishing their own societal relevance. As Governments respond to the demands of industry and commerce to fit graduates for the workplace, universities are being asked to provide students with the knowledge and skills for learning and working in an ever-changing workplace. There is a strong implication here that the traditional theory-based learning associated with higher education needs to be augmented (and complemented) by an experiential component that enables students to develop a 'feel' for the workplace and 'an instinct' for what they are likely to be doing when they are working. Demands for such a change are not only coming from industry: students are asking that their university programs be made more 'relevant' to the reality of work rather than merely for the next step in the higher education ladder which requires the 'skills of research'. Recently there has been a strong move throughout the western world towards 'cooperative education' or 'work-integrated education'. Local initiatives at individual institutions are beginning to emphasise the importance of universities developing more symbiotic relationships with the industries in which their graduates are likely to be employed. In Australia, Griffith University has, for example, set up through its Griffith Institute of Higher Education (GIHE) The Griffith Graduate Project, which is attempting to develop an institution-wide policy in this area so that a concerted and coordinated response can be made. As convenor of a Griffith University workplace-based experiential course in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, I find this study has provided an opportunity to examine the key determinants of success for a workplace-based course and to consider in detail the teaching and learning processes involved. The aim was to examine the fine-grained processes underlying the construction of new knowledge as students accommodate to the demands placed upon them. The methodology adopted was based on an interpretive constructivist paradigm and addressed a number of questions that considered the roles of the different stakeholders in a specific workplace-based course, the formal and informal expectations held of them, and the role-conflicts these stakeholders tended to experience. This meant that the basic process followed was inductive rather than deductive, worked from the specific to the general and required a methodology that did the same. Because the nature of the work in criminal justice agencies often must deal with feelings and emotion, it was assumed that the students' emotional responses could affect their learning so the methodology allowed for the subjective interpretations and responses (both appropriate and inappropriate) made by all stakeholders and the data was collected as verbatim reports of both factual reports and feeling responses. These were then analysed according to the students' own reports of learning and key principles of procedure for the design and implementation of such courses across the career spectrum were extracted. The values and approaches of action research were central to the responsive case study methodology that was developed. The study found that at its best, the course was conducted according to principles that enabled the student to experience an intuitive 'felt reality' while still making decisions on a strong cognitive base. The acquisition of knowledge appeared to depend on transactions that occurred between teacher and learner, supervisor and student in the workplace milieu. The thesis concludes with a number of recommendations and implications for developing best practice in the field. Ways in which the findings may be incorporated into university policy are also considered, as are the implications for change in the design, conduct and teaching of university professional studies courses.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Experiential learning</field><field name="subject">theory-based learning</field><field name="subject">work-integrated education</field><field name="subject">cooperative education</field><field name="subject">professional education</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060112.141825</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Undoing Big Daddy Art: Subverting the Fathers of Western Art Through a Metaphorical and Mythological Father/Daughter Relationship</field><field name="creator">Batorowicz, Beata Agnieszka</field><field name="description">The canon of Western art history provides a selection of artists that have supposedly made an 'original' contribution to stylistic innovation within the visual arts. Although a process of selection cannot be avoided, this procedure has resulted in a Eurocentric and patriarchal art canon. For example, the Western art canon consists of certain white male artists who are given exclusive authority and are often referred to as the 'fathers of art'. As the status of a 'father of art' pertains to the highest level of achievement within artistic creativity, I argue that this excellence in creativity is based on a gender specific criteria. This issue refers to the patrilineage within Western  art history and how this father-son model, in a general sense, excludes women artists from the canon. Further, the very few women included in the art canon are not given the equivalent status as a 'father of art'. I address this patriarchal bias through focussing on the father/daughter relationship as a way of challenging the patrilineage within Western art history&#146;s patrilineage. Through this process of intervention, I position the daughter an assertive figure who directly confronts the fathers of Western art. Within this confrontation, I emphasise that the daughter has an assertive identity that is also beyond the father. On this premise my paper is based on the argument that the application of a father/daughter model, within a metaphorical and mythological sense, is useful in subverting the father figures within Western art history. That is, I construct myself as the metaphorical and mythological daughter of the Dada artist, Marcel Duchamp and the Fluxus artist, Joseph Beuys.  As an assertive daughter, I insert myself into the patriarchal framework surrounding these two canonical figures in order to decentre and subvert their authority and phallocentric art practice. It is important to note that both Duchamp and Beuys are addressed as case studies (not as individual arguments) that illustrate the patriarchal constructs of the art canon. Within this premise, I draw upon the female artists Sherrie Levine and Jana Sterbak who directly subvert Western father figures as examples of assertive daughter identities. Within this exploration of the assertive daughter identity, I discuss feminist psychoanalysis (particularly the 'object relations' theorist Nancy Chodorow and the French feminist, Luce Irigaray) in order to offer metaphorical representations of the assertive daughter. These metaphors also assist in subverting the gender (male) specific criteria for creativity under the 'law of the father'.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western art canon</field><field name="subject">patriarchy</field><field name="subject">patriarchal bias</field><field name="subject">gender studies</field><field name="subject">artists</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">Joseph Beuys</field><field name="subject">Marcel Duchamp</field><field name="subject">Sherrie Levine</field><field name="subject">Jana Sterbak</field><field name="subject">feminist art history</field><field name="subject">feminist psychoanalysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040319.090547</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Handling Over-Constrained Temporal Constraint Networks</field><field name="creator">Beaumont, Matthew</field><field name="description">Temporal reasoning has been an active research area for over twenty years, with most work focussing on either enhancing the efficiency of current temporal reasoning algorithms or enriching the existing algebras. However, there has been little research into handling over-constrained temporal problems except to recognise that a problem is over-constrained and then to terminate. As many real-world temporal reasoning problems are inherently over-constrained, particularly in the scheduling domain, there is a significant need for approaches that can handle over-constrained situations. In this thesis, we propose two backtracking algorithms to gain partial solutions to over-constrained temporal problems. We also propose a new representation, the end-point ordering model, to allow the use of local search algorithms for temporal reasoning. Using this model we propose a constraint weighting local search algorithm as well as tabu and random-restart algorithms to gain partial solutions to over-constrained temporal problems. Specifically, the contributions of this thesis are: The introduction and empirical evaluation of two backtracking algorithms to solve over-constrained temporal problems. We provide two backtracking algorithms to close the gap in current temporal research to solve over-constrained problems; The representation of temporal constraint networks using the end-point ordering model. As current representation models are not suited for local search algorithms, we develop a new model such that local search can be applied efficiently to temporal reasoning; The development of a constraint weighting local search algorithm for under-constrained problems. As constraint weighting has proven to be efficient for solving many CSP problems, we implement a constraint weighting algorithm to solve under-constrained temporal problems; An empirical evaluation of constraint weighting local search against traditional backtracking algorithms. We compare the results of a constraint weighting algorithm with traditional backtracking approaches and find that in many cases constraint weighting has superior performance; The development of a constraint weighting local search, tabu search and random-restart local search algorithm for over-constrained temporal problems. We extend our constraint weighting algorithm to solve under-constrained temporal problems as well as implement two other popular local search algorithms: tabu search and random-restart; An empirical evaluation of all three local search algorithms against the two backtracking algorithms. We compare the results of all three local search algorithms with our twobacktracking algorithms for solving over-constrained temporal reasoning problems and find that local search proves to be considerably superior.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">temporal reasoning</field><field name="subject">over-constrained temporal networks</field><field name="subject">over-constrained temporal problems</field><field name="subject">algorithm</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="subject">scheduling</field><field name="subject">network</field><field name="subject">networks</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041213.084512</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships among Knowledge Creation, Diffusion and Utilisation in the CRC Process</field><field name="creator">Beesley, Lisa</field><field name="description">Tourism has come to be recognised as a major contributor to national economies.  In a knowledge-based economy (that emphasises the benefits of industry/government and academic research), a strong research base must underpin management of a tourist destination if it is to realise its full potential.  The establishment of collaborative networks between industry, academia, and government in the strategic planning and management of cities and towns is becoming increasingly popular.  However, the way in which the processes underlying these settings facilitate or inhibit eventual outcomes is poorly understood. If knowledge is to drive innovation and economic growth optimally, it is important not just to develop an understanding of the processes underlying the creation, diffusion and utilisation of knowledge in cooperative research settings, but also the relationships among them.  Accordingly, the aim of this investigation is to examine the relationships among knowledge creation, diffusion and utilisation occurring in the Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) Program, specifically, the Gold Coast Visioning Project, with a view to identifying the most efficient means for formulating and disseminating research designed for industry and/or government application. Knowledge is defined as information that is imbued with meaning or relevance.  However, this definition says little of the ways that individuals, groups and organisations acquire knowledge.  While cognitive psychologists have produced several theories suggesting the structure and mechanisms of individual cognitive processes underlying the acquisition and use of knowledge, social scientists have sought to describe and explain the process by investigating the influence of social factors.  Recent contributions to group learning have examined group composition, group size, familiarity among group members, and communication processes in an attempt to understand the ways in which groups acquire knowledge.  Research shows that knowledge utilisation in organisations results from the interdependent influences of organisational processes and the control opportunities and control problems that arise through organisational structure.  These frameworks provide accounts of how knowledge is utilised within an organisation, but not of how organisations learn. Recent research suggests that organisations learn through knowledge networks where organisational focus moves from the consideration and protection of boundaries to the management of (and care for) relationships.  Therefore, organisations contain static (rules, norms and procedures) and dynamic (social relationships) elements that mutually influence the degree to which organisations learn.  A synthesis of the available literature resulted in the development of a series of models that served not only to inform, but also be informed by the analysis of this investigation.  A single case study, namely the Gold Coast Visioning Project, was used to examine the ways in which knowledge was created, disseminated and utilised in a CRC setting.  This ethnographic investigation considered the process of knowledge creation through to utilisation at individual, group, organisational, and inter-organisational levels, while simultaneously examining the interrelated influences of social, cognitive, affective and communication factors.  Throughout the project, data were collected through stakeholder interviews, various documents and participant observation of stakeholder meetings and workshops.  Data were analysed using a grounded theory approach and methods of thick description. The results show that researchers and industry stakeholders bring different frames of reference, different expectations, and different knowledge bases to the exercise.  This inhibited communication, and gave the appearance of dissension when, in fact, what was being sought was a common frame for understanding and communication.  Additionally, the gap between industry and researcher worldviews generated the sense that industry was resisting or failing to understand what the research was seeking to achieve.  Consequently, in order to manage the relationship, research plans and findings were communicated to industry in a teacher-to-student fashion, which fostered single-loop learning, and reduced industry stakeholders' sense of ownership in the process and findings.  During the project, industry stakeholders frequently sought to have research come pre-packaged with "meaning", but researchers lacked the contextual knowledge necessary to specify the relevance of their research.  The results also show that research findings need to be integrated and diffused to industry over time, and specific applications need to be formulated (and reformulated) in response to particular and changing needs of industry.  As a result of this investigation, a model of 'best practice' has been developed with detailed recommendations for the design, implementation, and reporting of CRC-sponsored research to optimise its utility for end-users of such research.  From a theoretical perspective, the findings of this study challenge the ways that current theories account for the ways in which knowledge is acquired and utilised since the results show that knowledge is constructed both socially and emotionally.  Any investigation that seeks to understand how knowledge is acquired and utilised must consider social and affective influences.  To ignore the role of emotion and values in the process of knowledge acquisition is to ignore a key component of an individual's reasoning capacity.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CRC</field><field name="subject">CRCs</field><field name="subject">Cooperative Research Centre</field><field name="subject">Cooperative Research Centres</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">knowledge acquisition</field><field name="subject">knowledge utilisation</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">organization</field><field name="subject">organizations</field><field name="subject">organisations</field><field name="subject">organisational</field><field name="subject">organizational</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast Visioning Project</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040901.125713</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re:Collections - Collection Motivations and Methodologies as Imagery, Metaphor and Process in Contemporary Art</field><field name="creator">Berry, Jessica</field><field name="description">By the 1990's many modes of artwork incorporated the constructs of the museum. Art forms including, 'ethnographic art', 'museum interventions', 'museum fictions' and 'artist museums' were considered to be located in similar realms to each other. These investigations into this emerging 'genre' of collection-art have primarily focussed upon the critique of the public museum and its grand-narratives. This thesis will attempt to recognise that the critique of institutional hierarchical systems is now considered integral to much collection art and extends this enquiry to incorporate private collections which examine the narratives of everyday existence. This paper adopts an interdisciplinary approach to material culture and art criticism in examining everyday objects within contemporary collection-art. In this context, this paper argues that: the investigation of collection motivations (fetish, souvenir and system) as metaphor, process and imagery in conjunction with the mimicking of museology methodologies (classification, order and display) is an effective model for interpreting everyday objects within contemporary collection-art. In formulating this argument, this paper examines the ways in which artists emulate museology methodologies in order to convey cultural significance for everyday objects. This is explored in conjunction with the employment of collection motivations by artists as a device to understand elements of human/object relations. In doing so, it contemplates the convergence between the practices of museums and collection-artists. These issues are explored through the visual and analytic investigations of key artist case studies including: Damien Hirst, Sylvie Fleury, Mike Kelley, Christian Boltanski, On Kawara, Luke Roberts, Jason Rhoades, Karsten Bott and Elizabeth Gower. In doing so, this paper argues that the everyday objects of collection-art can represent a broad range of socio/cultural concerns, so delineating a closer relationship between collection-art and material culture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collection art</field><field name="subject">ethnographic art</field><field name="subject">museum interventions</field><field name="subject">museum fictions</field><field name="subject">artist museums</field><field name="subject">collection motivations</field><field name="subject">contemporary art</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070327.151934</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community Control Theory and Practice: a Case Study of the Brisbane Aboriginal and Islander Community Health Service</field><field name="creator">Best, Odette Michel</field><field name="description">It is accepted protocol among Indigenous communities to identify one's link to land. I was born and raised in Brisbane. My birth grandmother is a Goreng Goreng woman, my birth grandfather is a Punthamara man. However, I was adopted by a Koombumberri man and an anglo-celtic mother after being removed at birth under the Queensland government policy of the day. The action of my removal and placement has had profound effects upon my growing and my place within my community today. For the last 15 years I have worked in the health sector. My current position is as a Lecturer within the Department of Nursing, Faculty of Science, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba. My areas of expertise are Indigenous Health and Primary Health Care. I have been employed in this capacity since January 2000. Prior to my full time employment as a nursing academic I have primarily been located within three areas of health which have directly impacted upon my current research. I was first positioned within health by undertaking my General Nurse Certificate through hospital-based training commenced in the late 1980s. For me this training meant being immersed within whiteness and specifically the white medical model. This meant learning a set of skills in a large institutionalised health care service with the provision of doctors, nurses, and allied medical staff through a hospital. Within this training there was no Indigenous health curriculum. The lectures provided on 'differing cultures' and health were on Muslim and Hindu beliefs about death. At that point I was painfully aware of the glaring omission of any representation of Indigenous health and of acknowledgment of the current outstanding health differentials between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I knew that the colonisation process inflicted upon Indigenous Australians was one of devastation. The decline in our health status at the time of colonisation had been felt immediately. Since this time our health has been in decline. While in the 1980s it was now no longer acceptable to shoot us, poison our waterholes, and incarcerate us on missions, we were still experiencing the influence of the colonisation process, which had strong repercussions for our current health status. Our communities were and remain rife with substance abuse, violence, unemployment, and much more. For Indigenous Australians these factors cannot be separated from our initial experience of the colonisation process but are seen as the continuation of it.

Spectra of the region near the S1fS0 electronic origin of four neutral van der Waals molecules - aniline-argon, phenol-argon, chlorobenzene-argon and fluorobenzene-argon - were obtained using resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI). These spectra indicate that Fermi resonances between van der Waals stretching and bending motions are important in these molecules. Effective Hamiltonians are constructed that describe well the low frequency vibrations. In order to better discuss the low frequency van der Waals motions of aromatics bound to one and two rare gas atoms a simple model for the vibrations is developed. The model enables expression of van der Waals frequencies in terms of fundamental molecular properties and enables facile comparison of effective force constants in a variety of van der Waals molecules. The model is successfully employed to explain van der Waals vibrational structure associated with the origin region of aniline-(argon)2 using van der Waals potential parameters derived from the aniline-(argon)1 spectrum. REMPI and emission spectra of larger clusters of aniline and argon are also reported and discussed. Using atom-atom potentials, equilibrium structures for aniline-(argon)n (n=l, 2, 3) are calculated. The calculations prove useful in the analysis of the spectra.The BfX transitions of the cation complexes fluorobenzene+-argon and chlorobenzene+-argon have been investigated. The cations were prepared by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization of the neutral van der Waals molecules. A time delayed tunable dye laser was then used to dissociate the cations, loss of an argon atom being the dominant process. When the second laser was tuned to a cation resonance the dissociation cross section increased markedly, allowing characterization of BfX transition. The resulting spectra are presented and discussed.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">neutral clusters</field><field name="subject">ionic clusters</field><field name="subject">van der Waals frequencies</field><field name="subject">Hamiltonians</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051109.112502</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entrepreneurs: Interrelationships Between Their Characteristics, Values, Expectations, Management Practices and SME Performance</field><field name="creator">Blackman, Alan John</field><field name="description">This original research seeks to identify unique predictive relationships between the characteristics, values and expectations of entrepreneurs in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and the management practices they choose; and then, the relationships between those practices and business performance. It adds to the current understanding of the impact of entrepreneurs on the performance of their businesses and has also led to the development of two new tools for assessing the performance of SMEs.  Growth of the SME sector is important to the public policy agendas of governments, like those in Australia, that are seeking to optimise the employment opportunities associated with an SME sector in which "success" is the norm because SME failure, or underperformance, is associated with many social costs; costs that include reduced earnings for proprietors, potential job loss for staff and financial hardship for suppliers, as well as a reduction in the average per capita spending power of the community in which the failed or under performing business is based.  For the SME, business strategy development and implementation is often the role of the entrepreneur owner-manager. The characteristics, values and expectations of entrepreneurs in SMEs may thus influence their choice of management practices and thereby the performance of their businesses. As Cooper (1998) argued: "the primary motivations of the entrepreneur bear upon not only the decision to start but also upon the decisions about how to manage, including whether or not to grow the firm aggressively" (p. 247). Johnson (1990) suggested that there is a strong need to focus future research on the motivation mechanisms of entrepreneurs as drivers of the entrepreneurial process. Johnson's view supports the entrepreneurial trait school of thought that development of an understanding of the individual entrepreneur's characteristics, values and expectations might provide worthwhile insight into her or his behaviour and its relationship to SME success and failure.  The purposes of this research, therefore, were, first, to determine the importance of the attributed and attained characteristics of the entrepreneur on the formation of his or her values and expectations; second, to determine the influence of those values and expectations on the choice of management practices; third, to determine the degree to which those management practices influence business performance; and last, to develop a scale of measurement for entrepreneur characteristics, values and expectations that can be used to predict business performance. To enable limited comparison with Kotey's and Meredith's (1997) findings and to control for between industry and between state influences, the chosen context for the research was the furniture industry in Queensland. To add to current knowledge in SME management practices and performance, two new measurement tools were developed for this research. The first quantifies the positiveness of the business intentions of the entrepreneur. The second is a scaled index of perceived performance that takes account of the importance given by an entrepreneur to eight common business objectives and the degree to which he or she is satisfied with the performance of the business for each objective. Both tools are important additions to the limited existing armoury of tools available to researchers seeking to understand and predict SME performance.  For the first time, the findings of this research indicate negative relationships between parent occupation skill levels and the importance given by entrepreneurs to the values of responsibility, honesty and competence and the negative role of the entrepreneur's achieved highest qualification on the importance given to values of affection, compassion, religion and national security. The findings thereby highlight the important role played by an entrepreneur's attained characteristics on the formation of his or her values. As well, the results show the important role played by values such as power and responsibility, as well as by high internal locus of control, on an entrepreneur's selection of planning, marketing and future management practices. In turn, the impact of those practices on business performance, as measured by the overall satisfaction of the entrepreneur and the newly created Scaled Index of Perceived Performance, is demonstrated. In so doing, the results shed more light on the complex relationships between entrepreneurs, the management practices they choose, and business performance. For the furniture industry in Queensland, the findings confirm Cooper's (1998) view that there is an empirical relationship between business founding processes and the performance of the business. Also supported is Kotey's and Meredith's (1997) broad finding for the furniture industry in New South Wales that "personal values of owner/managers, the strategies they adopt in operating their firms, and the performance outcomes of their businesses are empirically related" (1997, p. 59). Future research is needed to develop a causal model for those relationships in a variety of SME and other contexts.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SME</field><field name="subject">SMEs</field><field name="subject">small-medium enterprises</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurs</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurial</field><field name="subject">business</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">managing</field><field name="subject">manager</field><field name="subject">managers</field><field name="subject">owner-managers</field><field name="subject">values</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040615.154732</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Computer Model of Creativity Based on Perceptual Activity Theory</field><field name="creator">Blain, Peter J</field><field name="description">Perception and mental imagery are often thought of as processes that generate internal representations, but proponents of perceptual activity theory say they are better thought of as guided exploratory activities. The omission of internal representations in the perceptual activity account has led some to see it as computationally implausible. This thesis clarifies perceptual activity theory from a computational perspective, and tests its viability using a computer model called PABLO. The computer model operates in the Letter Spirit domain, which is a framework for creating stylistic variations on the lowercase letters of the Roman alphabet. PABLO is unlike other computer models of perception and mental imagery because it does not use data-structures to represent percepts and mental images. Mental contents are instead modelled in terms of the exploratory activity in which perceptual activity theory says they consist. PABLO also models the flexibility of imagery, and simulates how it can be harnessed and exploited by the system to generate a creative product. PABLO is a first attempt at an implementation of perceptual activity theory, but the results suggest that the theory is computationally viable, and that it has advantages over other theories of mental imagery in the context of creativity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">perceptual activity theory</field><field name="subject">computational perspective</field><field name="subject">PABLO</field><field name="subject">Letter Spirit domain</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070823.171325</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the Role of Thioredoxin in the Invasive Phenotype and its Interaction with the Transcription Factor Sp1</field><field name="creator">Bloomfield, Kelly Louise</field><field name="description">Thioredoxin is a small ubiquitous oxido-reductase found in all species.  The highly conserved active site, which facilitates thioredoxins redox activity, contains two redox active cysteine residues.  Thioredoxin has numerous protein substrates to which it donates H+ ions and it can also function as a free radical scavenger.  Through these activities thioredoxin is able to influence the redox state of not only its protein targets, but also the entire cellular environment.  Thioredoxin has been implicated in many biological functions, and one mechanism by which it influences these functions is through interactions with a number of transcription factors including NF-kappa-B and p53.  Thioredoxin also has numerous extracellular biological roles.  It has been shown that thioredoxin is actively secreted from a number of normal and transformed cell lines including fibroblasts and activated B and T cells. This study investigates the role of thioredoxin in embryonic implantation and cancer cell metastasis, two physiological functions which rely on the same basic processes.  Thioredoxin expression has previously been shown to be increased in many cancers.  However it has not yet been established whether this increase is a causative or a side effect of the cancerous phenotype.  Similarly thioredoxin expression has previously been shown to be increased during different phases of the oestrus cycle and pregnancy. This thesis describes the role of thioredoxin in embryonic implantation using a marmoset model.  A thioredoxin cDNA was isolated and subsequently sequenced.  Preliminary antibody experiments indicated that the anti human thioredoxin monoclonal antibodies available in our laboratory would recognise marmoset thioredoxin.  Subsequently immunocytochemistry using anti human thioredoxin antibodies was carried out on sectioned marmoset uterus and embryonic tissue.  The results indicated that thioredoxin is expressed by cells at the embryonic-maternal interface of early implantation sites.  Further studies demonstrated that thioredoxin is also expressed and secreted by cultured blastocysts in vitro.  This thesis also describes the role of thioredoxin in cancer cell metastasis.  Results of this study indicate that thioredoxin is actively involved in facilitating the invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells.  The two cell lines utilised were MCF-7, a well differentiated, relatively non-invasive breast cancer cell line; and MDA-MB-231, a poorly differentiated, highly invasive breast cancer cell line.  The cell lines were transfected with thioredoxin sense, antisense and 1SS (encodes thioredoxin with both active cysteine residues mutated to serine residues and is thus redox inactive) constructs. The results demonstrate that when endogenous thioredoxin levels are increased, i.e. transfected with a sense thioredoxin construct, the invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 becomes more invasive, conversely when endogenous levels are decreased, i.e. transfected with antisense or 1SS constructs, the invasive capacity of these cells decreases.  However, when the endogenous level of thioredoxin was manipulated in the relatively non-invasive cell line MCF-7 very little effect was observed.  Results also indicate that thioredoxin has the ability to act as a chemoattractant for actively invading breast cancer cells.  Both of these functions appear to be dependent on thioredoxin's redox activity.  Additional studies described in this thesis have shown that thioredoxin is involved in the regulation of Sp1 in vitro.  Sp1 is a transcription factor known to regulate the transcription of a number of genes whose products are intimately involved in the invasive phenotype.  The results in this study suggest that Sp1 DNA binding is regulated by thioredoxin such that when reduced by the enzyme its binding to DNA is facilitated.  Results also indicate that Sp1 may regulate the transcription of thioredoxin by binding to Sp1 sites within the thioredoxin promoter.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thioredoxin</field><field name="subject">genetic transcription factors</field><field name="subject">embryonic implantation</field><field name="subject">cancer cell metastasis</field><field name="subject">marmoset</field><field name="subject">marmosets</field><field name="subject">phenotype</field><field name="subject">phenotypes</field><field name="subject">invasive phenotype</field><field name="subject">invasive phenotypes</field><field name="subject">Sp1</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031021.120018</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of Students' Experiences of Learning in Higher Education</field><field name="creator">Bond, Carol Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the development of tertiary students' experiences of learning as they progress through three years of undergraduate study in two different psychology programs. Previous research that is relevant to this topic has tended to focus either more narrowly on the development of epistemic beliefs or more broadly on the variation of learners' experiences of learning. Research on epistemic beliefs has tended to focus on the structural aspects (stages) of development and to ignore the content of thinking. In contrast, research on experiences of learning has concentrated upon the content of students' experiences, yet it can be criticised for the way in which it decontextualises students' experiences and for its limited attention to change and development. Moreover, despite evidence suggesting that learning comprises a complex of phenomena such as understanding, memorising and knowing, this line of research has tended to treat learning as a single phenomenon. In the thesis I draw on Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics, Gurwitsch's view of awareness, and much of the conceptual framework of the phenomenographic perspective to argue a case for a theoretical framework and consequential practices that are more plural and inclusive of learner's experiences of learning. The new approach refocuses the relationship between researcher, knower and known in terms of the knowing relation-one that involves a dynamic iterative interweaving of first and second order perspectives. Using this new approach, students' experiences are analysed to provide rich description and ontological explanation of both change and development over time. The approach allows the unity of the partlwholelpart relation of an individual's experience to be recognised. So the method is able to take account of the contextual relevancy of the individual whilst also focusing on the experiences of the group. The results show that rather than comprising a single phenomenon, learning is itself part of a multi-dimensional (depth, spatial and temporal dimensions), multi-phenomenal field. The phenomena of learning, understanding, memorising and knowledge are described in detail, and their individual internal relations are elaborated along with the internal relations between the phenomena. Four main groups of experiences of learning are described within this framework: reproductive experiences; relational experiences; constructive experiences; and transformative experiences. Each of these categories comprises several sub- categories. This fine-grained focus on individual students' data, and the use of the phenomenographic whadhow framework, allows the development of experiences to be traced and interpreted as a gradual morphing over time. The pattern of development suggests that each part of the learners' journey plays an important role in the growth of skill and competence in learning. Thus, it may be important that curricula account for variation not by focussing upon transformative experiences of learning, as is often the case, but by facilitating shifts through all of the experiences that learners may pass through.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tertiary students</field><field name="subject">experiences of learning</field><field name="subject">H.

In this program of research two studies were conducted.  The first study was to investigate the variables that put couples at risk for developing a combination of relationship and alcohol problems.  The second study was an evaluation of the effects of an integrated education program that promoted safe drinking and positive relationship interaction.  Previous research shows that deficits in negative affect regulation and poor communication predict the onset of both relationship and alcohol problems. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that deficits in communication exist in couples in which one or both partners drink at hazardous levels. In Study 1 communication of 85 couples (53 couples with no high-risk drinker and 32 couples with at least one at-risk drinker) in early stage committed relationships was assessed by observation of their interaction. Couples in which the man was drinking at hazardous levels had significantly more negative communication than couples without an at-risk drinker.  In Study 2, 37 couples with at least one at-risk drinker were randomly assigned to either Controlling Alcohol and Relationship Enhancement (CARE) or a control condition. Couple communication, alcohol consumption, relationship satisfaction and relationship stability were assessed at pre- and post-intervention. Alcohol consumption, relationship satisfaction and relationship stability were also assessed at 6-month follow-up. Couples receiving CARE improved their communication significantly relative to the control couples. Couples in both conditions showed significant reductions in hazardous drinking, but there was no significant difference in the effects of the interventions on alcohol consumption.  The program of research demonstrates that deficits in couple communication are evident in couples with hazardous male drinking, even in the early stage of the relationship when the couples report high relationship satisfaction. The communication deficits are remedied with brief, skill-training relationship education. Furthermore, there was evidence for the effects of CARE on reduction of steps towards relationship dissolution at 6-month follow-up. The brief alcohol component of the intervention showed little benefit beyond the control condition in terms of impact upon the alcohol problems. This research is the first to demonstrate that a combined program of skill-based relationship education and strategies for alcohol reduction is effective in remediating communication skills deficits in the early stage relationships of couples with hazardous alcohol consumption. Future research can extend this work to enable the development of programs which match the content of relationship education to the specific needs of other high-risk couples.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alcohol use</field><field name="subject">alcohol abuse</field><field name="subject">alcoholism</field><field name="subject">alocholic</field><field name="subject">alcoholics</field><field name="subject">problem drinking</field><field name="subject">couple</field><field name="subject">couples</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">relationship</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">CARE</field><field name="subject">Controlling Alcohol and Relationship Enhancement program</field><field name="subject">relationship education</field><field name="subject">counseling</field><field name="subject">counselling</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040322.092510</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Job Strain and Healthy Work in Teachers: a Test of the Demands-Control-Support Model</field><field name="creator">Bradley, Graham</field><field name="description">Over the past two decades, research into worker well-being has been greatly influenced by the demands-control-support models of Robert Karasek (1979; Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990).  These models propose that worker strain and active learning are determined by particular combinations of job demands, job control and social support.  Specifically, incumbents of jobs that are high in demands, low in control, and low in support are expected to show high levels of strain, whilst incumbents of jobs that are high in all three job factors are expected to display high levels of activity, learning and participation, both on and off the job.  The models also propose that prolonged exposure to combinations of these job conditions influence workers' accumulated anxiety and sense of mastery.  If empirically substantiated, Karasek's models have profound implications for the design of "healthy work" environments. This thesis represents an attempt to clarify, critically evaluate, extend and test Karasek's models.  Self-report data, as well as information obtained from a collateral source, are used to assess the independent linear, quadratic, additive and interactive effects of Karasek's job factors.  Multivariate models of the direct and indirect relationships between the job factors and a range of possible antecedents and consequences are proposed and submitted to empirical test.  Two major, and several minor, studies, all using samples of school teachers, are reported. The first major study used a cross-sectional design, and self-report measures of demands, control and job stressors to predict several indices of worker strain (e.g., stress, job dissatisfaction, somatic complaints).  Analyses of data from 421 teachers revealed independent and additive effects of demands and control on strain, but few quadratic or interactive effects.  Demands and control also predicted job stressfulness, with additional evidence showing that the effects of demands on this outcome were buffered by perceived job control. The second major study tested Karasek's models using a two-wave full panel design, and an expanded set of predictor, moderating and outcome variables.  Data were collected from 987 teachers, as well as from a significant other person nominated by the majority of these teachers.  Demands, control and social support were shown to predict stressors and strain, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Results generally confirmed Karasek's additive strain hypotheses.  Consistent evidence of interactive effects of the job factors on strain was not found in the full sample of teachers, but was obtained when analyses were limited to a sub-sample of new-start workers.  Relationships between the job factors and measures of worker activity and participation were also found.  However, rather than all three job factors acting conjunctively, demands and support from supervisors predicted some outcomes (e.g., the number of hours teachers worked), control and support from co-workers predicted other outcomes (e.g., self- and other-reported levels of vigour-activity), whilst a further set of indices (e.g., participation in organized activities outside of work) were not strongly related to any of the job factors.  Exposure to highly demanding jobs was associated with increases over time in levels of neuroticism, whilst exposure to high control job conditions was associated with increases in levels of mastery.  The demands-mastery relationship was buffered by perceptions of job control.  Limited support was obtained for a set of additional predictions regarding the role of leadership style in shaping job factors, and hence worker strain. In general, the results from this research confirm past findings regarding the effects of job demands, control and social support on strain.  The research makes several important contributions to the literature.  From a research methods viewpoint, new, congruent and specific measures of the job factors, activity-participation outcomes and leadership dimensions were developed.  Also novel was the use of structural equation techniques to test competing longitudinal models that involved continuously-measured interaction terms.  Substantively, the research represents one of most comprehensive investigations yet conducted into Karasek's models.  The test of the dynamic person-environment hypotheses is believed to be unprecedented in the literature, as is the attempt to demonstrate links from leader behaviour, through the job factors, to strain. Implications for Karasek's models include the need to reject the additive hypothesis in relation to activity-participation, and to extend the models to incorporate organizational antecedents of demands, control and support.  More practically, the research reinforces the importance of providing "control-enhancing" opportunities for workers exposed to highly demanding jobs.  Recommendations for future research include the need to test an expanded model of healthy work using multi-wave longitudinal designs, samples of new-start workers, and multiple (including objective) measures of key variables.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Job stress</field><field name="subject">Robert Karasek</field><field name="subject">Teachers</field><field name="subject">Teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050725.125838</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contending With Feminism: Women's Health Issues in Margaret Atwood's Early Fiction</field><field name="creator">Braun, Kirsten</field><field name="description">Margaret Atwood's early fiction provides a valuable insight into issues surrounding the establishment of the women's health movement. From The Edible Woman in 1969 to The Handmaid's Tale in 1985, Atwood's work takes up key issues of the movement during this time. Her fiction explores a number of women's health topics including contraception, abortion, birthing, assisted reproductive technologies, eating disorders and breast cancer. Atwood's interest in the appearance of victims in Canadian literature, however, leads to a rejection of the notion that women are fated victims of patriarchal institutions like medicine. This thesis argues that while she does not deny women can be victims, she refuses to accept that this role is inevitable. Foucault's later constructions of power and resistance are explored with the female protagonists refusing to believe their situations are inescapable. Atwood's recognition of her role as a popular fiction writer and her refusal to wear the 'feminist' label allow her the space to critique the women's health movement. Her early fiction exposes the absolutism of the movement and demonstrates its limitations in accounting for women's diversity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Margaret Atwood</field><field name="subject">popular fiction</field><field name="subject">women in literature</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070212.153530</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Journalism, Ethics and Accountability: Evaluating the Virtues of Self-Regulation</field><field name="creator">Breit, Rhonda</field><field name="description">This dissertation questions whether the current system of journalistic self-regulation in Australia can give effect to ethical journalism given the conceptual paradigms that have informed its understanding of journalism and journalism ethics. It argues the ideological focus of journalistic self-regulation has constrained the current system's ability to encourage ethical journalism. By taking a grounded theory approach to developing an alternative theory of journalism, this study attempts to fill a void in the reform of journalistic self-regulation in Australia by first highlighting the shortfall in recent reviews. It then argues reform must address the ideological focus of the journalism industry. This means looking at the ideologies espoused in the industry codes. It also means looking at the ideologies that frame how values reflected in the codes are interpreted. In summary, my aim in this dissertation is to articulate a praxis-driven theory of journalism by which to examine the suitability of the Australian self-regulatory environment to give effect to ethical journalism. This will be done by: mapping the current system of journalistic self-regulation; distilling the ideological foci of contemporary interpretations of journalism and journalism ethics; postulating an alternative theory of journalism as practice; evaluating the current system of self-regulation in light of the theory of journalism as practice; and recommending an alternative model of self-regulation that takes account of the theory of journalism as practice. The grounded theory approach to this study involves a textual analysis of a representative sample of self-regulatory codes to identify deficiencies in the way philosophical understandings of identity and ethics have been applied to journalism. By highlighting the gaps in the conceptual paradigm that frames the current theories of journalism and journalism ethics, I offer insights into key problems facing industry self-regulation. Given its grounding in substantive data analysis, the theory developed in this study is able to offer significant insights into ways of improving journalistic self-regulation to encourage ethical journalism. By categorising the self-regulatory codes according to ideology, I aim to explain how core journalistic values can be marginalized. Thus, this study aims to reveal problems with the way in which journalism self-regulation has been conceptualised and operationalised. In this way, it uses the tools of meta-ethics and normative ethics to analyse an ethical problem. Thus the grounded theory emerging from this study falls into the conceptual category of applied ethics. This approach offers a flexible methodology that allows the development of an emergent theory based on raw data derived from the various codes that operate within the journalistic self-regulatory environment. The research problem starts broadly, looking at the ability of the current system of journalistic self-regulation to encourage ethical journalism. The focus of the study is on organizational ideology and conceptions of journalism, rather than individual values of journalists. Through a process of constant comparison I will focus the research problem, constructing a theoretical framework to evaluate whether the current system of journalistic self-regulation can encourage ethical journalism. To achieve these objectives, the study will canvass both process (the ability of self-regulation to give effect to ethical journalism) and action (building a theoretical framework for conceptualising reform). A grounded theory approach offers a way of categorising conceptions of journalism and self-regulation allowing me to develop an alternative theory of journalism that promotes a holistic approach to journalism ethics. This study does not purport to offer final solutions to the ethical problems within Australian journalism. It does, however, aim to present an alternative pathway towards reform of journalistic self-regulation in Australia that focuses on encouraging ethical journalism and expanding the theoretical paradigms that shape current approaches to ethics.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">journalists</field><field name="subject">journalistic</field><field name="subject">ethic</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">ethical</field><field name="subject">self-regulation</field><field name="subject">code</field><field name="subject">codes</field><field name="subject">charter</field><field name="subject">charters</field><field name="subject">conduct</field><field name="subject">principles</field><field name="subject">practice</field><field name="subject">self-regulatory</field><field name="subject">grounded theory</field><field name="subject">values</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040628.102346</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Physical Habitat Modification for Mosquito Control, Runnelling, on Selected Non-Target Saltmarsh Resources</field><field name="creator">Breitfuss, Mark</field><field name="description">Runnelling is a popular method of physical habitat modification employed on saltmarshes to control pest mosquito populations.  The runnelling method involves linking the tidal source to isolated mosquito breeding pools via shallow channels that enable slow water movement of low amplitude tides.  Increased tidal flushing inhibits mosquito development.  The range of organisms which inhabit saltmarsh are likely to be influenced by altered tidal conditions as they exhibit specific physicochemical requirements for feeding, burrowing or growth.  The dynamic nature of saltmarsh may mean that changes to the tidal frequency of a particular region of the saltmarsh promotes extension of marine-like conditions. Because runnels increase the frequency of flooding tidal events in specific regions of the saltmarsh this study predicted that resulting changes would be evident in the physical conditions of saltmarsh substrate, in the transport of buoyant vegetative propagules, in the population characteristics of surface grazing snails and in the density and aperture of crab burrows after flooding and non-flooding tidal events. The physical impacts of runnelling were determined at three marshes which appeared similar in terms of topography, substrate and tidal conditions.  Soil water content and consolidation were measured using two sampling protocols: a) comparisons between modified and unmodified shores; and, b) comparisons with increasing lateral distance across the shore from the runnel edge.  At one marsh, moisture levels were significantly higher at runnelled than at unrunnelled sites when tides filled the runnels, but this pattern was not found at the other marshes.  Soil consolidation was greater at higher shore heights, but was not different between runnelled and unrunnelled shores.  Measurements at different lateral distances from runnels demonstrated higher moisture levels and lower consolidation up to 5 m from the edge but not further away. Groups of marked Avicennia marina propagules were released at the three runnelled saltmarshes during flooding and non-flooding tidal events. Groups of propagules released within 10 m of a runnel were always transported significantly further from the starting position and further up the saltmarsh shore after both flooding and non-flooding tides than any other groups.  In addition, the pattern of stranding on saltmarsh for significantly different groups was closely associated with the path of runnel construction so that propagules were located either in the runnel or in depressions linked to the runnel that had been isolated mosquito-breeding pools prior to runnelling. It is likely that altered physical soil conditions significantly affected the distribution and size structures of Salinator solida and Ophicardelus spp. snails recorded at the three saltmarshes.  The interaction of tidal period and the presence of a runnel contributed to patterns with significant differences between runnelled and unrunnelled regions of the marsh.  Generally, the runnel population of snails exhibited flood-like features even during non-flood periods.  The distribution and size classes of snails did not differ with lateral distance from runnels. The burrow characteristics of the crab Helograpsus haswellianus were compared to increase the accuracy of estimating abundance from burrow counts.  Including only those burrows which were obviously maintained by resident crabs significantly increased the confidence limits of estimating crab abundance using only burrow density counts.  This method was applied to runnelled and unrunnelled sites to assess any changes in the density of burrows associated with the presence of runnels.  Again, it is likely that physical soil conditions resulting from increased tidal frequency at the runnel did influence crab burrowing with fewer small burrows being found at the runnelled site, low on the shore.  In addition, mid- and large-sized burrows tended to dominate close to the runnel edge. Site-specific soil characteristics may help to explain the lack of continuity in patterns associated with runnel effects on non-target saltmarsh resources.  While the runnel may increase the soil water content of clayey substrates at some sites it could also result in de-watering of porous sandy soils at other shores.  This was evident in the structure of the snail population and distribution of crab burrows which appeared to reflect altered soil physical characteristics associated with the runnel. Runnelling does affect non-target organisms in saltmarsh.  However, the scale of impact was usually locally restricted (&lt; 10 m from the runnel edge).  The fact that patterns were not recorded at all sites suggests that the influence of runnels is variable and limited by substrate and some biological conditions.  Given the efficiency and popularity of runnelling as a physical control method for reducing pest vector mosquito habitat, this study found no evidence to suggest that its use should be discontinued on any ecological basis measured.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">runnelling</field><field name="subject">intertidal wetlands</field><field name="subject">wetland ecology</field><field name="subject">saltmarsh ecology</field><field name="subject">habitat modification</field><field name="subject">crabs</field><field name="subject">snails</field><field name="subject">mosquitoes</field><field name="subject">mosquito control</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20031126.074304</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">English Language Immersion: Theorising from Stakeholders' Accounts</field><field name="creator">Bridges, Susan Margaret</field><field name="description">This research is a case study of stakeholders' perceptions of learning and provision during a specific English language program. The pedagogical context of the program was clearly defined. English teachers from Hong Kong who had either Cantonese or Mandarin as their first language (L1) came to Australia for intensive language proficiency training and assessment. The Hong Kong government determined the program's syllabus, including assessment instruments and criteria in the Syllabus Specifications for the Language Proficiency Assessment for Teachers (English Language) (LPATE) (Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), 2000). The Australian provider had created the program from the specifications and had developed appropriate teaching and assessment materials for its implementation in all syllabus components. Additionally, the provider was responsible for administering and marketing the program. Delivery was in immersion mode with the Hong Kong teachers travelling to Australia and residing with Australian 'homestay' families for the 6-week program. The 'guiding issue/question' for the case study was: How did the multiple stakeholders perceive learning and provision? The study drew on a corpus of data collected from the perspectives of various stakeholders within provision of a 6-week in-service and education training program (INSET) (Bolam, 1986) for Chinese first language (L1) primary and secondary school teachers. Stakeholders represented in the study were teachers who participated as learners; the researcher who was a part-time language instructor; a course designer who was a full-time language instructor in the program; and an administrator who also held a wider role in the general marketing of INSET. Multiple forms of data were collected and analysed within a case study design (Stake, 1995, 2000). These included: a document analysis; pretest and posttest questionnaires; semi-structured interviews from individuals and focus groups; stimulated recall interviews from individuals; learner journals; and a researcher journal. Existing knowledge was reviewed through a search of literature, policies and accounts that examined four contextual layers that framed the study and situated it in terms of global, local and intercultural issues. Specifically, the layers were: (a) imperatives for Australian higher education to internationalise; (b) provision of INSET for teachers of English as a Second or Foreign Language (ESL/EFL); (c) language education and proficiency in Hong Kong; and (d) intercultural communication and culture learning as they pertained to an immersion program.  While higher education institutions in Australia have recognised the imperative to internationalise, some recent initiatives are poorly researched. Bodycott and Crew (2001a, p. 23) noted a 'dearth' (p. 2) of literature surrounding short-term, immersion versions of INSET such as that used in the current research.  A review of literature where INSET had been used for the education of language teachers provided important insights into issues that might affect learning and provision. These involved the extent to which teachers' home country contexts were included in the design and content of programs, whether 'one-off' programs could be effective in the long-term, and what models underpinned the current design of INSET. The major gaps in the literature were (a) reported research on INSET where it is delivered as a short-term, immersion program to South East Asian teachers; and (b) published work on the LPATE as a learning-teaching experience. The current study attempted to address these gaps. While there was an absence of literature on the specific context of the INSET under study, the literature did reveal ways for the teacher/researcher to objectify and reflect on INSET provision. Literature on interactionism and social constructivism provided insights into the role and effect of the teacher/researcher in a data-gathering process. The case study approach was reviewed and Stake's (1995, 2000) design used in the study within a theoretical framework of social constructivism. In its reporting, the case accounts for forces of change surrounding the participants' INSET. These included the internationalisation of Australian higher education and curriculum reform in Hong Kong. At more personal levels, participants provided reflective data throughout the immersion experience. These data from the Hong Kong teachers indicated perceptions of strong positive growth in their English proficiency. This is an outcome consistent with the purpose of the INSET, which was to improve and benchmark proficiency standards. The data also revealed that the teachers had learned much about pedagogy and culture, which formed insights into intercultural negotiation and learning. The providers - an administrator and an instructor - supported accounts their learners had given of learning and provision. Yet, each had particular views regarding what constituted success in delivery of an INSET. While the case study provided detailed explication of the 'nature' of this particular INSET, this researcher supports Crew and Bodycott's (2001) call for further, longitudinal research into the phenomenon. Drawing on findings from this study, specific research questions are suggested to investigate the effects of immersion INSET. Within the constraints of case study method, implications are drawn for the design and delivery of future short-term, immersion INSET. A detailed mapping of what stakeholders reported as culture learning and cross-cultural experiences provided an account of this aspect of the phenomenon. There was strong evidence that a component based on intercultural communication should be included in any future trial to inform INSET design. A new model, entitled 'Intercultural INSET', is proposed for future implementation and research. It incorporates domains of learning established from the case study data and is informed by a theoretical construct designed in the current study and termed, 'Positive Effect Chain'. The proposed model embeds the design within contexts significant to the teacher/participants and to their ongoing critical reflection. This ongoing reflection informs thinking about the proposed INSET course evaluation. Finally, the proposed model extends INSET into a post-immersion phase. This subsequent phase extends participants' INSET interaction, once they have returned to their own countries and to their work in home classrooms. The model seeks enduring and effective learning and requires trial and further study. The case study approach provided a successful vehicle for organising the data of the research and for framing the discussion. It also yielded indications as to the means by which INSET providers might structure ongoing feedback and assessment of their intended curriculum design. These indications are reflected in the proposed 'Intercultural INSET' design.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language immersion</field><field name="subject">Chinese TESOL students</field><field name="subject">Mandarin first language</field><field name="subject">Cantonese first language</field><field name="subject">intercultural INSET</field><field name="subject">in-service education training</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060322.144245</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relevance of Accounting Information for Valuation and Risk</field><field name="creator">Brimble, Mark Andrew</field><field name="description">A key theme in capital markets research examines the relationships between accounting information and firm value. Two concerns relating to the value relevance of accounting information are: (1) concerns over the explanatory and predictive power of the evidence presented in the prior literature (Lev, 1989); and (2) the evidence of a deterioration in the association between accounting information and stock prices over the past four decades (Collins, Maydew and Weiss, 1997; Francis and Schipper, 1999; Lev and Zarowin, 1999). These concerns provide the key motivation for this thesis which examines: (1) the usefulness of the clean surplus accounting equation in valuation; (2) the role of accounting information in estimating and predicting systematic risk and; (3) the changing nature of the relationship between accounting information, stock prices and risk over time. The empirical research provides evidence of the value-irrelevance of the clean surplus equation and that controlling for the functional form of the earnings-returns relationship is more important. Evidence is also provided that accounting variables are highly associated with M-GARCH risk betas and also possess predictive ability relative to these risk measures. Finally, the relationships between stock prices, risk models and accounting information are shown to have not deteriorated over time, contrary to prior evidence. Rather, the functional form of the relationship has changed from linear to a non-linear arctan association. Overall, accounting information continues to play the central role in the determination of stock prices and risk metrics.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corporations</field><field name="subject">corporation</field><field name="subject">firms</field><field name="subject">firm</field><field name="subject">value</field><field name="subject">valuation</field><field name="subject">accounting</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">stock price prediction</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030829.120234</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of DNA Evidence on the Criminal Justice Process</field><field name="creator">Briody, Michael</field><field name="description">This research examines the effects of forensic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence on decisions in the courts and on the conduct of criminal investigations.  To assess effects on court decisions, quantitative analyses were conducted using primary data from the State of Queensland.  A control-comparison method was used to assess the effects in court, and this was made within a context of other evidentiary and extra-legal factors that had a bearing on case outcomes.  These other factors included defendant confessions, independent witness testimony and fingerprint and photographic evidence.  A sample of 750 cases referred by police for prosecution and finalised past the appeal stage in court, was selected for examination.  Half of these cases utilised DNA evidence, while the other half, as a control group, did not.  Cases were selected in four categories: sexual offences, serious assaults, homicides and property crime.  Data on the cases were analysed using advanced statistical methods and predictor models were developed to demonstrate how, given case configurations, the addition of DNA evidence could potentially alter court outcomes. Results for the three serious offence types were that DNA evidence emerged as a positive predictor that prosecutors would pursue cases in court, and it demonstrated a powerful influence on jury decisions to convict.  Incriminating DNA evidence demonstrated no significant effect on inducing guilty pleas from defendants for serious crimes against the person.  However, it did correlate significantly to cases reaching court and to guilty pleas being entered for property offence cases. The analysis of the effects on investigations relies on data from jurisdictions other than Queensland.  Secondary data and the literature were used to assess the potential for strategically using forensic intelligence, along with dedicated investigative resources, to reduce property crimes like burglaries and car thefts.  In the one study available that employed adequate research methods, three patrol areas in New South Wales, where a police operation was trialled, were compared to other areas that acted as a control.  The police operation aimed at 100% attendance at property crime scenes, the use of intelligence from DNA and fingerprint identifications and specialised investigative resources to reduce crime levels.  While the operation failed to achieve its goal, it did provide some valuable lessons. The effectiveness of the national criminal DNA database in the UK, reputed to lead the world, was then evaluated in relation to domestic burglaries.  Its Australian CrimTrac counterpart did not commence operations until March 2003, and by 2004 was not operating at maximum capacity.  Because no published studies were located that measured any effects of the UK database on crime levels, the criterion selected to measure performance was the proportion of convictions achieved through the database to reported crime.  For domestic burglaries, this ratio was calculated from secondary official data to be close to one percent (0.01), a figure that included the additional convictions achieved through the intelligence that the database provided. The research also examined forensic DNA in relation to issues of privacy and civil liberties.  Privacy issues are discussed beginning with an historical background to the use and misuse of genetic data.  This includes the searches for a 'criminal gene' and for genetic links to criminal behaviour.  DNA databases are contrasted with databanks, and it is questioned, since we leave our DNA wherever we go, whether it really is private.  Civil liberties issues that are discussed include whether providing DNA is a form of self-incrimination; how DNA has helped exonerate the convicted innocent; wrongful convictions based on flawed DNA evidence; whether occasional 'mass screenings' with DNA are a reversal of the onus of proof; concerns with DNA databases and 'function creep', and the planting or 'forgery' of DNA evidence including the use of amplicon contamination. In the final chapter, a balance is sought between on one hand, the goal of police and government to provide a safe society, and on the other, the rights to privacy and civil liberties expected by individuals in Western liberal democracies.  The chapter addresses the issues of concern raised in the earlier chapter about privacy and civil liberties, and makes recommendations on how these may be resolved.  The general approach favoured is to increase police powers in specific situations, but to couple these with the protection of individual rights through greater regulation of those powers.  The research also developed a case prioritising system aimed at helping clear laboratory backlogs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic science</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">criminal investigations</field><field name="subject">police</field><field name="subject">criminal databases</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050818.155533</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Age and Aerobic Training on T Helper Lymphocyte Proliferation</field><field name="creator">Broadbent, Suzanne</field><field name="description">Deficiencies in immune responses can lead to increases in the rate of infections and chronic diseases, such as cancer. Critical to the adaptive immune response is the activation of the T helper (Th)/CD4+ cell, the subsequent production of interleukin 2 (IL-2), expression of IL-2 and transferrin receptors (IL-2R, TfR) and transcription of genes resulting in DNA synthesis and T cell clonal expansion. The CD4+ lymphocyte response is impaired with ageing. Recent evidence suggests that moderate, regular aerobic training may increase the responsiveness of CD4+ lymphocytes to antigenic and mitogenic challenge, and thereby improve immune function in the older individual. Large volumes of chronic endurance training, and also high intensity training, may adversely affect the immune response, leading to immunosuppression and increased risk of infections. Impaired immune function and increased rates of URTI are found in athletes who undergo large volumes of training, often at high intensity. Purpose: To investigate if long-term aerobic training improved the immune response in men and women aged 65 to 75 years and, and to investigate if long-term  endurance training depressed the immune response in male athletes aged 23 to 36 years. Methods:T helper lymphocyte proliferation was assessed monthly, by inducing the expression of CD25 (IL-2R ) and CD71 (transferrin) receptors with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Percentage of CD4+ cells positive for the receptors, and the receptor density, were measured using two colour flow cytometry. Concentrations of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and iron (Fe3+) were also measured monthly to determine the effect of endurance training on intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and Fe3+ ([Fe3+]i) within the CD4+ lymphocyte signal transduction pathway. Results: After twelve months of moderate aerobic training the percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes positive for CD25 increased in males aged 65 to 75 years, but not in females. There was no training effect on the density of CD25 in either gender, nor was there a training-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, total intracellular [Ca2+] from endoplasmic reticulum stores ([Ca2+]t) or [Fe3+] in this age group. Significant month to month variations in leucocyte, erythrocyte and haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, platelets, CD25 expression, CD71 expression, [Ca2+] and [Fe3+] were documented for both trained and untrained male and female groups. Aerobic capacity increased significantly with training for both men and women, with increases in  peak, peak power and peak ventilation (p less than 0.05). Twelve months of chronic endurance training produced significantly lower haemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin and platelet concentration for six ([Hb]) and nine months ([MCHC], platelets) of the year in Ironman-distance triathletes, compared to sedentary males aged 23  to 36 years. There was no evidence of immunosuppression in the trained group, with no significant differences between groups in the percentage of CD4+ cells positive for CD25. The trained group showed a significantly higher density of CD25 receptors in October, January and June, suggesting a better immune response during these months. Endurance training did not effect [Ca2+] or [Fe3+]. The trained group did not show a reduced leucocyte concentration, and reported significantly fewer cases of URTI in twelve months than their sedentary counterparts. The 23 to 36 years age group showed seasonal changes in haematological and immunological indices similar to older individuals, indicating that autumn, late winter and late spring are periods of reduced immuno-competency. Conclusion: Twelve months of moderate intensity training significantly increased functional capacity in older men and women, and the percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes expressing CD25 in older men, thereby improving the lymphoid immune response. Twelve months of endurance training significantly increased CD25 density in CD4+ lymphocytes in Ironman triathletes compared to sedentary young males. The monthly changes in immune variables in young and older subjects suggested that autumn, late winter and late spring might be periods where individuals were more at risk of succumbing to infections due to decreased lymphocyte responsiveness. Summer months appeared to be a period of increased lymphocyte responsiveness and proliferation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunodeficiency disease</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">immune</field><field name="subject">immune response</field><field name="subject">T-helper</field><field name="subject">lymphocyte</field><field name="subject">lymphocytes</field><field name="subject">aerobic training</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050113.115912</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career and Family: The Role of Social Support</field><field name="creator">Broers, Catharina Maria</field><field name="description">Balancing a successful career with a family life can be challenging and impact on a person's satisfaction in their work and family roles, affecting not only the person but their partner and children as well. This study examined the influence of social support from family and work associates on the role satisfaction of female and male managers, and their children's adjustment. Participants were 96 male and 100 female managers and their families. The first aim of this study was to examine the relative importance of work and family support for satisfaction in the roles of paid worker, spouse and parent. Findings showed that social support had a domain-specific effect, with work support associated with job satisfaction, and family support associated with marital and parenting satisfaction. The second aim of the study was to evaluate gender differences in perceived social support, and the association of support with role satisfaction. Although there were considerable differences in the managers' work and family arrangements, female managers and male managers reported receiving similar levels of work and family support, and the strength of the relationship between social support and role satisfaction was similar for both genders. The final aim of the study was to examine the role of social support in the larger family system, as research has mainly focussed on the influence of social support on the support recipient. This study extended research on the relationship between social support and role satisfaction, by showing that family support was not only associated to managers' role satisfaction, but also to managers' interactions with their children, and their children's adjustment. Work support on the other hand, was related to job satisfaction, but not to parent-child interactions and child adjustment. The findings from this study could inform clinicians' treatment of families with children experiencing problems by addressing the relationship of family support with child adjustment. Findings could also inform governments' work and family agendas, which generally focus on providing assistance to employers with the development of workplace policies to improve work-family balance. Governments should also promote the role of family support, and provide information for families on how to arrange household and childcare tasks and provide support to each other to facilitate work-family balance. Furthermore, the current study showed that work support is positively related to employee's job satisfaction, which is important for employees as well as employers. Employers can promote supportive relationships among employees through establishing networking opportunities for their employees, such as breakfast meetings, workshops and seminars, and business planning days. This study showed that some people can have it all - a satisfying and successful career, a happy marriage, and fulfilling parenthood - and social support appears to play a significant role in achieving this.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Career and family</field><field name="subject">family roles</field><field name="subject">career roles</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="subject">family arrangements</field><field name="subject">parent-child interactions</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070110.095525</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stakeholders' Meanings of Effective School Leadership: A Case Study in a New Zealand Primary School</field><field name="creator">Brooker, Barry N</field><field name="description">Guided by the theoretical underpinnings of symbolic interactionism, this study set out to describe and analyse how stakeholders in a New Zealand Primary School understand effective school leadership, and how their meanings of leadership are influenced by the context in which they work. Review of the school leadership literature indicated that there was widespread agreement on the importance of leadership for school effectiveness but limited empirical data on how, or why, this was the case. To gain an understanding of stakeholders' meanings of effective leadership the study adopted a qualitative, case study design. Purposive, criterion-based selection was used to select a school considered to have highly effective leadership practices and to identify a cross-section of stakeholders within that school. The participants were the principal, Board of Trustees chairperson, assistant principal, teacher, general staff member, and student. Data were gathered from concept maps, semi-structured interviews and selected school documents such as the school's Education Review Office report and staff job descriptions. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods of analysis, specifically the use of constant comparison through open and axial coding. The findings of the study are presented and examined in terms of three theoretical propositions that encapsulate the stakeholders' meanings of effective school leadership. The first proposition examines three core values - concern for the individual, a commitment to learning, and an expectation of high performance - that permeated the school and influenced stakeholders' meanings and leadership practices. The second proposition examines the provision of direction, which involved articulation of a strong vision, use of symbols and ceremonies, modelling valued practices and beliefs, and raising the aspirations of staff and students. The third proposition examines leading and managing processes, which included the development of a team structure, leading and managing staff appointments and non-performance, managing communications, meetings and time, and providing opportunities for decision-making and leadership. Although considered in separate chapters, the three theoretical propositions are inter-related. The findings from this study highlight the importance of a set of core, common values for school leadership, confirm the role that leaders play in providing direction through a variety of symbolic activities, re-emphasise the need for studies of leadership to consider the context specific and people-based aspects of leadership, and confirm the place of teams in achieving a school's goals and reinforcing its values. The findings of the study also identify a need for team learning and development, and for a greater focus on values and beliefs in development programmes for principals. In addition, from both a theoretical and practical perspective, the findings establish a need for further research into the conception and practice of distributed leadership, and indicate that principals continue to play a central leadership role in self-managing, primary schools. The study's findings, thus, add to an at present limited base of empirical data on school leadership, and provide an insight into the perspectives of those involved in the leadership processes. Although the study's findings are based on a single school, in a particular context, the research design and methodology, including use of theoretical propositions, means the findings and conclusions generated from the study are pertinent to leadership theory, leadership research and leadership policy and practice in various contexts. The findings of this study are therefore likely to be of use to researchers of educational leadership, school principals, other school leaders, educational policy makers, and those designing and implementing professional learning programmes for principals and other school leaders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School leadership</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Primary School</field><field name="subject">Education Review Office</field><field name="subject">School Board of Trustees</field><field name="subject">provision of direction</field><field name="subject">concern for the individual</field><field name="subject">leading and managing processes</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061023.151530</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of the Constructs of Ageing on Gerontic Nursing Practice and Education: Reviewing the Past and Suggesting the Future</field><field name="creator">Brooker, Jennifer Anne</field><field name="description">This narrative inquiry traces and recounts an epiphaffic experience of a registered nurse on entering gerontic nursing, and her subsequent three-decade journey through the complexities and mazes of this nurse specialty. Such inquiry seeks to enable a better understanding of the realities of ageing and caring for older adults by opening up thinking and beliefs underpinning gerontic nursing work. Modern aged healthcare involves complex gerontic nursing actions, requiring highly skilled nursing personnel, but on the whole, gerontic nursing is dimly perceived and misunderstood by professional colleagues and the general public. Much of this misunderstanding is a legacy of an outdated ideology of gerontic nursing; yet these public beliefs, attitudes and interpretations are extremely powerful in determining aged care policy. As the population ages and more elderly people access healthcare services, society will be faced with an array of complex political and socioeconomic factors. This thesis aims to untangle such choices by pursuing the questions of: How have the constructs of ageing impacted on gerontic nursing practice and education?, What type of gerontic nurse will be required to provide future elderly care? and How will these people be educationally prepared for their new roles? Many of the constructs explored are dialectical in nature; that is, they have developed by inner conflict, the scheme of which is thesis and antithesis, or an original tendency and its opposing tendency. Such dialectical thinking has underpinned much of this thesis and in many instances, particularly in chapter 7, has taken the next step to the unification of these opposing tendencies; that is, synthesis, to create new understanding or meaning. Issues explored relate to: the ontology of ageing; the meaning of life; gerontophobia; Australia's changing population profile; changing aged healthcare systems; gerontic nursing cultural dilemmas; workforce planning; elder health in the future and gerontic nursing practice and education shifts. In a theoretical and methodological context, increasing difficulty with conventional epistemologies and the science founded on them is leading nurse theorists ever nearer to a postmodernist position. Narrative becomes a means through which gerontic nursing can accumulate and express cultural knowledge and critique procedure. The thesis exemplifies narrative's profound potential for underpinning the reconceptualisation of gerontic nursing practice and education. It is narrative's capacity to foreground the relationship between daily practice and knowledge that makes it a critical tool for the future of gerontic nursing inquiry. Narrative facilitates the paradigm, or more ontological shift from the dominant medical model of aged healthcare and 'tender loving care' rhetoric, to a therapeutic, caring-healing approach which has been in the margins in gerontic nursing practice. In the context of gerontic nurse education, narrative pedagogy offers new ways of thinking even in the midst of oppressive practices. Many issues remain unresolved about how gerontic nurses can be educated for future gerontic nursing practice. It would seem that aged care in Australia is a site of such organisational and cultural change, it threatens to undermine knowledge, care and understanding and shift care to untrained staff. The thesis illustrates how such approaches cloak much of gerontic nursing practice and devalue the intimate work of caring intelligently, emotionally and physically for frail older adults. However, while such tensions abound in gerontic nursing practice, the 2l~ century offers skilled gerontic nurses the opportunity to become key components in the refigured and redesigned aged healthcare delivery system. Research indicates that because few know enough about the sum of the future to impede well-constructed attempts at engaging in any new model design, taking any action is infinitely better than none. It is on this premise that Chapter seven posits a new model design for residential long-term aged care for older adults, believing that by imagining a different future, it can then be created and become a reality.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gerontic nursing</field><field name="subject">aged healthcare</field><field name="subject">registered nurses</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050906.140153</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Frozen Continent: The Fall and Rise of Territory in Australian Constitutional Thought 1815-2003</field><field name="creator">Brown, A. J. (Alexander Jonathan)</field><field name="description">Through the late 20th century, global society experienced waves of unprecedented political and institutional change, but Australia came to be identified as "constitutionally speaking... the frozen continent", unable or unprepared to comprehensively modernise its own fundamental laws (Sawer 1967).  This thesis opens up a subject basic to, but largely unexplored in debate about constitutional change: the territorial foundations of Australian constitutional thought. Our conventional conclusions about territory are first, that Australia's federal system has settled around a 'natural' and presumably final territorial structure; and second, that this is because any federal system such as possessed by Australia since 1901 is more decentralised and therefore more suitable than any 'unitary' one.  With federalism coming back into vogue internationally, we have no reason to believe our present structure is not already the best. Reviewing the concepts of territory underpinning colonial and federal political thought from 1815 to the present day, this thesis presents a new territorial story revealing both these conclusions to be flawed.  For most of its history, Australian political experience has been based around a richer, more complex and still evolving range of territorial ideas.  Federalism is fundamental to our political values, but Australians have known more types of federalism, emerging differently in time and place, than we customarily admit.  Unitary values have supplied important symbols of centralisation, but for most of our history have also sought to supply far less centralised models of political institutions than those of our current federal experience.  Since the 1930s, in addition to underutilising both federal and unitary lines of imported constitutional theory, Australian politics has underestimated the extent to which our institutional treatment of territory has itself become unique. Despite its recent fall from constitutional discourse, territory is also again on the rise.  While political debate has been poorly placed to see it, Australia has experienced a recent resurgence in ideas about territorial reform, offering the promise of a better understanding of the full complexity of our constitutional theory and a new 'unfreezing' of the assumption that territorially, Australia will never change.  This thesis seeks to inform these vital new debates.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian history</field><field name="subject">territory</field><field name="subject">territorial</field><field name="subject">federation</field><field name="subject">federal government</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">political</field><field name="subject">constitutional</field><field name="subject">Constitution</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041105.092443</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote Intelligent Air Traffic Control Systems for Non-Controlled Airports</field><field name="creator">Brown, Glenn</field><field name="description">Non-controlled airports are literally that - uncontrolled. Safe separation is achieved by pilot vigilance. The consensus of reports on incidences at noncontrolled airports generally conclude that pilots cannot rely entirely on vision to avoid collision and attempts should be made to obtain all available traffic information to enable a directed traffic search. Ideally, a system is required which has the ability to provide advice to all parties to ensure separation minima is maintained. Provision of a such a system would remove a measure of pressure from the pilot to allow that person to devote their attention to their prime responsibility of flying the aircraft. To this end, research on use of intelligent remote advisory systems for non-controlled airports was undertaken with emphasis on those systems which could minimize human resources and associated recurring costs, to provide a measure of repeatability and to provide an acceptable level of safety. A rule based system was developed and evaluated. The evaluation showed that use of a rule based system as the basis of an intelligent remote air traffic control system for non-controlled airports is a viable proposition. In test scenarios, collision hazards were identified and evasion tactics generated. For a full operational system, the application of the rules and definition of the aircraft circuit area may need refining; however, the results are certainly encouraging.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ATC</field><field name="subject">air traffic control systems</field><field name="subject">collision avoidance</field><field name="subject">intelligent remote advisory systems</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040225.084516</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient Removal and Plant Growth in a Subsurface Flow Constucted Wetland in Brisbane, Australia</field><field name="creator">Browning, Catharine</field><field name="description">One of the major water quality issues affecting waterways is eutrophication. Controlling the input of nutrients from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WTP&#146;s) is a significant step in reducing eutrophication. Tertiary wastewater treatment for water quality improvement in particular Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) is often expensive to construct with high maintenance costs. Constructed wetlands (CWs) offer an alternative wastewater treatment and have been used successfully worldwide to treat various types of wastewater. This study investigated the effectiveness of the Oxley Creek horizontal subsurface flow (SSF) CW for tertiary municipal wastewater treatment and the suitability of four native macrophyte species, Baumea articulata, Carex fascicularis, Philydrum lanuginosum and Schoenoplectus mucronatus. The investigation consisted of four main components: 1) Plants: monitoring plant establishment, growth, impact of cropping, gravel size, nutrient content and storage for the four macrophyte species trialed; 2) Water quality - effluent treatment: monitoring water quality and quantity entering and leaving the wetland to determine wastewater treatment; 3) Organic matter: accumulation of organic carbon within the wetland cells for the different gravel sizes (5mm and 20mm) and 4) Mass balance: combining nutrient storage by macrophytes with wastewater nutrient removal to determine proportion of nutrient removal by plant uptake. The Oxley horizontal SSF CW is situated at the Oxley Creek WTP in Brisbane (South- East), Queensland, Australia which has a sub-tropical climate. The experimental design involved four different substrate treatments: Cell A new 5mm gravel, Cells B and C old 20mm gravel and Cell D old 5mm gravel. Cells B, C and D had been operational since 1995 whereas Cell A had been in use since 2000. The wetland received secondary treated effluent direct from the Oxley Creek WTP at an average flow rate of 8L/min with a median hydraulic loading rate (HLR) of 0.12m/day and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 to 3 days. Each cell consisted of three gravel sections (Section 1 to 3) separated by 1m wide open water sections. Gravel Sections 2 and 3 were planted out with the four macrophyte species in October 2000, Section 1 remained unplanted. Plant health and leaf height was monitored to assess plant establishment and growth. Investigations into plant establishment and growth demonstrated that Carex was most suitable. Carex achieved the highest maximum leaf height and was not affected by pests and disease unlike Schoenoplectus and Philydrum. Above ground biomass was cropped in May and August 2001, with biomass of cropped material measured on both occasions. Plant health and re-growth following cropping of above ground biomass in May and August 2001 demonstrated that cropping retarded regrowth of Schoenoplectus and Philydrum. Carex and Baumea recovered quickest following cropping, with Carex achieving leaf height prior to cropping within 6 months. Proportion of biomass contained above and below ground was measured by collecting biomass samples three times over 9 months and dividing into plant components (roots, rhizomes, leaves, flowers and stems). Investigations into the proportion of above and below ground components indicated that &gt;80% of biomass is contained above ground. Therefore cropping above ground biomass would potentially remove a significant proportion of nutrient storage from the CW. The results indicated that the ideal time for cropping was in spring/summer when plants are flowering particularly for Philydrum, whose flowering stems comprised 40% of total plant biomass. Flowering stems of Philydrum could potentially have a commercial use as a cut flower. Nutrient content of the four species in each cell was measured for individual plant components when first planted and after three (summer) and six (autumn) months growth. This was combined with biomass data to quantify nutrient bioaccumulation (nitrogen and phosphorus) by the four species in each cell. In terms of ability to bioaccumulate nitrogen and phosphorus, measurements of nutrient content and storage indicated that all four species were suitable. Nutrient storage was highest for Baumea and Carex. However high nutrient content may make the macrophytes more susceptible to pest and disease attack as found in this study for Philydrum and Schoenoplectus. Nutrient storage was highest in Cell A (new 5mm gravel) as a result of higher biomass achieved in this cell. The cropping and nutrient storage experiments indicated that Carex was the most suitable species for use in SSF CWs. Carex achieved the highest nutrient storage and had the fastest regrowth following cropping. Organic carbon accumulation between gravel particles measured as the proportion of material lost at 500oC was determined for gravel samples collected from each section for all four cells at 10cm depth increments (0-10cm, 10-20cm and 20-30cm). Investigations into organic carbon accumulation within the gravel substrate showed that organic accumulation was higher in the planted sections particularly for cells that had previously been planted with Phragmites australis. Organic accumulation was highest in the top 20cm of the gravel, which can be attributed to litter fall and root material. The effect of gravel size on plant growth, biomass, root depth and organic accumulation was assessed throughout the study. Investigations indicated that gravel size did not appear to affect biomass, maximum root penetration, re-growth following cropping and organic accumulation. Water quality from the inlet and outlet of each cell was measured fortnightly over 12 months (May 2001 to May 2002). Water quantity (HLR) was measured weekly using tipping buckets located at the inlet and outlet of each cell. Water quality and quantity were combined to investigate the nutrient removal efficiency of the wetland. The Oxley wetland was highly effective in reduction of TSS (&lt;2mg/L) and COD (&lt;30mg/L). Principal TSS and COD removal mechanism was physical with the first gravel section acting as a filter removing the majority of particulate material. Average loading rates to the wetland were 7.1 kg/ha/d PO4-P, 14 kg/ha/d NH4-N and 5.4 kg/ha/d NOx-N. Average daily mass removal rates ranged from 7.3 kg/ha NH4-N in Cell D to 4.6 kg/ha in Cell C (i.e. 37%-22% removal efficiency respectively); 5.2 kg/ha NOx-N in Cell C to 1.3 kg/ha in Cell A (i.e. 75%-22% removal efficiency) and 0.8 kg/ha PO4-P in Cell A to 0.1 kg/ha in Cell C (i.e. 10%-1% removal efficiency). Removal efficiency was calculated on a loads basis. Insufficient retention times (2-3 days based on tracer study) and anaerobic conditions (&lt;1mg/L) limited further nitrogen removal. Negligible phosphorus removal for all cells was attributed to short retention time and likelihood of phosphorus adsorption being close to capacity. Investigation into the proportion of nutrient removal attributed to plant uptake demonstrated that nutrient uptake and storage in plant biomass accounted for &lt;12% TN and &lt;5% TP. This research project has provided several useful outcomes that can assist in future guidelines for designing effective SSF CWs in the subtropics/tropics. Outcomes include the importance of maintaining an adequate water level during the initial establishment phase. Maximising effluent treatment by pre-treatment of wastewater prior to entering SSF CWs to enable ammonia to be converted to nitrate and ensuring adequate hydraulic retention time. Carex fascicularis was the most suitable species particularly where harvesting regimes are employed. Philydrum flowering stems could be used as a cut flower in the florist trade.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">constructed wetlands</field><field name="subject">plant growth</field><field name="subject">biological nutrient removal</field><field name="subject">BNR</field><field name="subject">eutrophication</field><field name="subject">subsurface flow</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040226.092311</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of location and other attributes on the price of products which are place-sensitive in demand</field><field name="creator">Bull, Adrian Osborn</field><field name="description">There is a particular class of products where people must visit the point of production in order to be consumers, and these products are normally lifestyle, tourism or leisure services. Examples include environmentally-based leisure facilities, housing, and tourist accommodation. Frequently the assertion is made that location makes one product 'superior' to another, in terms of both its production and consumption. This study enquires into the asserted significance of location in product differentiation, with special reference to hospitality and tourism products. The study is particularly concerned with commercially tradeable products offered to a consumer market by a number of competitive firms, rather than being concerned with one-off markets for assets for exclusive use, such as houses. By the use of characteristics theory, this study shows that the role of geographic location within a product such as hotel accommodation is that of a product-differentiating characteristic, or set of characteristics. However, the location of such a product is an example of a fixed, or unalterable, characteristic, once a supplier has entered a market. With most product-differentiating characteristics, a supplier can attain an optimal  business position by enhancing the differentiation for as long as customers' willingness to pay 'the extra' (marginal revenue) exceeds or equals the cost (marginal cost) of product enhancement. However, a supplier cannot easily do this for a fixed characteristic. So what is the value of a particular location to a supplier of this type of product? This study develops a model to identify the specific elements of a location that are important to consumers, and then to estimate their values. It is argued that the values of each specific element (locational characteristics) should contribute in a predictable way to the overall price of each product in the market place. It is also shown in this study that individual suppliers who cannot identify, or who incorrectly set, prices based on locational characteristics face a measurable variation in demand from the mean in the market place. The model and methodology are tested empirically in the market for international-standard hotel accommodation on the Gold Coast, Queensland. It is shown that this constitutes a single, coherent market as a tourist destination, where a limited number of producers compete with differentiated products. Those product characteristics that are important to the market are identified, and it is shown that elements of location and other characteristics can be valued accurately across the market. The relationship between suppliers' 'overpricing' or 'underpricing' of their product characteristics and variations in demand from the market average is explored. This study therefore has implications for pricing strategy, as well as for land valuation and planning. The study can be seen as contributing primarily to the economics literature, in the area of industrial economics, but also to the marketing, and hospitality and tourism literature.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">industrial economics</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">pricing</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">hotel industry</field><field name="subject">location</field><field name="subject">hedonic pricing</field><field name="subject">product attributes</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030102.085840</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Relational Complexity Approach to the Development of Hot/Cool Executive Functions</field><field name="creator">Bunch, Katie</field><field name="description">Previous research indicates that many important changes in executive functions, or higher cognitive capacities, occur between the ages of three and five years. Additionally, a distinction can be made between the cognitive functions associated with two different cortical regions. The functions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC) are assessed using 'cool' tasks that are abstract and decontextualised. In contrast, the functions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are assessed using 'hot' tasks that require flexible appraisal of the affective significance of stimuli (Zelazo &amp; M&#252;ller, 2002). Different clinical populations have been hypothesized to differ in terms of their impairment on tasks associated with each area of functioning. Current research conclusions regarding the primacy of hot versus cool executive function impairments are limited, however, as they have not taken complexity into account. That is, tasks currently used in investigations of hot and cool executive functions might differ in terms of the complexity of the cognitive processes that the tasks require. Therefore, comparisons across tasks may be misleading because these tasks vary in terms of the demands they place on participants as well as their hot versus cool status. While complexity theories have been applied to a number of cool tasks, only one hot task, those measuring theory-of-mind abilities, have been analysed in terms of complexity. One aim of the current research was to modify several tasks presumed to measure OFC performance to include a complexity manipulation. Tasks from three hot domains (conditional discrimination, the Children's Gambling Task, and future-oriented decision-making) were analysed in terms of their relational complexity, that is, the number of related entities or arguments inherent in a task or concept (Halford, 1993). Based on these complexity analyses, binary-relational and ternary-relational items of each of these tasks were developed or existing tasks were selected and/or modified. The binary-relational items were closely matched to the ternary-relational items in terms of stimuli and procedure, however, they were lower in complexity. After pilot testing, the three new measures of hot executive functioning were included in a larger test battery that was administered to a sample of 120 normally developing 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-year-old children. Existing binary- and ternary-relational items assessing theory-of-mind (a hot task) and three cool measures (transitivity, class inclusion and the Dimensional Change Card Sort test) were also included. The inclusion of measures of both hot and cool executive functions, each with complexity manipulated, allowed for the examination of a possible differential age of emergence of executive abilities associated with the DL-PFC versus the OFC. In support of the relational complexity approach, significant complexity effects were found across all seven tasks. Items at a higher level of complexity were experienced as relatively more difficult by children of all ages. Significant effects of age were also observed, with performance across all tasks increasing with age. The age effects were strongest on the ternary-relational items. The pass-fail data indicated that the majority of children in all age groups succeeded on the binary-relational items. However, it was not until a median of five years of age that children were able to process ternary relations. Consequently, the ternary-relational items produce the greatest differences in performance between the four age groups. The overall pattern of the results also suggested that a distinction can be made between the ages of emergence of abilities associated with the OFC versus the DL-PFC. The results of the pass-fail percentages, patterns of age-related change and age effects on domain factor scores all suggested that while hot executive functions may begin to develop around four years of age, similar levels of improvement are not seen in cool executive functions until five years of age. Thus, the ability to succeed on ternary-relational items of hot executive function tasks appeared to emerge slightly earlier than the cool executive function tasks. Complexity appears to be a critical factor underlying children's performance on executive function tasks, and future assessment regarding the development of executive abilities will benefit from keeping this in mind. While some refinement of new task items may be beneficial, the current test battery may have utility in further examinations of the executive profiles underlying clinical groups, such as children with autism and ADHD.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Executive functions</field><field name="subject">dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</field><field name="subject">orbitofrontal cortex</field><field name="subject">binary-relational items</field><field name="subject">ternary-relational items</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070713.121052</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living Life to the Full: a Qualitative Study of Community Theatre, Older People and the Construction of Leisure</field><field name="creator">Burden, Josephine E</field><field name="description">Older women and men were participants in this qualitative research of three case studies of community theatre. Their stories, gathered through in-depth interviews and participant observation of the theatre projects over a four year period, informed the development of a theoretical model of leisure as process. Through devising and presenting their theatre pieces, 50 older people, ranging in age from 45-8 5 years, with differing cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, reflected on personal experiences, negotiated their own processes for working collaboratively, and presented the stories of theft lives publicly in a way which affirmed their actions and understandings of themselves and theft world. Interviews with more than 30 of these people allowed an analysis of the ways in which older people negotiated the processes of play-building and constructed meaning in their lives at a time when the social structures of paid work and family were becoming less central as people moved into their third age. This research has located the study of individual agency through leisure in the context of the social structures which shape constraints to leisure and in turn limit individual agency. As such, the research has been concerned both with the self and with social relationship and has theorised leisure as a process of negotiation. Since process implies change over time, the research methods used and the leisure context selected for study were also process oriented. The research methodology was emergent and took on qualities of action research as the study progressed. By focusing on community theatre as the social context for leisure, the nexus between community development, community theatre and action research was examined and found to inform a broader understanding of leisure as process. The research has also expanded knowledge of community theatre as a collaborative process which draws on individual and collective reflections to build public presentations of issues of concern to participants. The processes of community theatre have received no attention to date in the leisure literature. The negotiation of self takes place in different social contexts for women and for men, for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, for old and young, and for people from different socio-economic backgrounds. This research demonstrated that changes in personal situations as a result of the aging process, changes in family context and changes in work context are associated with changes in the negotiation of self, and these changes are expressed through leisure activity as well as other involvements less clearly classified as leisure. Purposive aspects of leisure assumed greater significance as people grew older and this was expressed in the culture of busyness and a pride in 'never being home'. Older women, in particular, developed friendships and community networks outside the family unit as relationships with husbands and children changed. These social connections were found to facilitate difficult transitions such as divorce or the death of a spouse. Community theatre supported the development of community networks, and presented an opportunity to claim a voice in the public arena and challenge the invisibility of older age. The research added to knowledge about constraints on leisure involvement by older people, and identified personal, social and material constraints. The most significant of these were the personal constraints of fear and of ill-health. However, participants in this research continued to negotiate a path through constraint in order to live their lives to the full. Analysis of their stories indicated that whilst constraint sometimes operated as a hierarchical process of control pushing people into isolation, people who were supported in their efforts to negotiate constraint through the development of community networks gained self-confidence and a heightened sense of agency. The processes of community development used in community theatre were found to facilitate the negotiation of constraint by developing personal skills and strengthening social support. The constructivist orientation of the research acknowledged the dialectical nature of knowledge construction and the possibility of social change through research. Aspects of action research were demonstrated in the processes of community theatre, which also seeks social as well as personal change. The research has a political motivation in that it seeks to strengthen the position of participants. Concern with the power relationship between researcher and researched facilitated a deeper understanding of the role of power in the process of leisure. The research opens up one small window on the processes whereby people may continue to live life to the full through active engagement in life and leisure.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community theatre</field><field name="subject">leisure involvement</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">personal situations</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050914.125729</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toxicology Investigations With The Pectenotoxin-2 Seco Acids</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Vanessa Anne</field><field name="description">Pectenotoxins (PTXs) are a group of large cyclic polyether compounds associated with diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) as they are often found in combination with other DSPs such as okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysis toxins (DTXs) in shellfish. Although classified and regulated with the DSPs, there is debate over whether these toxins should be classified with DSP toxins. To date, ten different analogues of PTXs have been identified from shellfish and algae, and of these, the pectenotoxin-2 seco acids (PTX2-SAs) are of particular interest as they have previously been implicated in a shellfish poisoning incident in Australia, but relatively little was known of their toxicology. One such incident occurred in December 1997, when approximately 200 people were reported with severe diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning in Northern New South Wales (NSW). Analysis of the shellfish associated with this incident revealed relatively high PTX2-SA concentrations (approx. 300 micrograms/kg shellfish meat), with only trace amounts of pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2) and OA. Following this incident, PTX2-SAs were considered a health threat and guidelines were implemented in the absence of toxicological data, which has caused a great economic burden to shellfish industries around the globe, in particular to Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. Such regulation created in the absence of scientific data demonstrated the need to determine the toxicology of PTX2-SAs in commercial shellfish. Thus a comprehensive study on the toxicology and possible health implications of the PTX2-SAs in Australian shellfish was conducted. PTX2-SAs were isolated in different batches from shellfish (pipis, oysters and mussels) and from algal bloom samples of Dinophysis caudata. Toxin extraction was conducted with several purification stages and chemical analysis was performed with high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS). The chemical stability of the PTX2-SAs was investigated to ensure consistency of doses between toxicology experiments. Acute dosing studies with mice were then performed and included toxicopathology investigations with light microscopy and electron microscopy, in addition to toxin distribution studies and investigation of in vivo lipid peroxidation. In vitro studies with HepG2 cells included cytotoxicity assays, cell cycle investigations using flow cytometry and gene expression profiling of cells exposed to PTX2-SAs employing cDNA microarray technology. Acute pathology studies demonstrated that the PTX2-SAs do not cause the characteristic symptoms or lesions associated with DSP toxins. No diarrhoea was observed at any dose level in mice and no deaths occurred up to the maximum dosing level of 1.6mg/kg PTX2-SA. Only one batch of PTX2-SA extract produced toxic lesions characteristic of a DSP toxin (batch 1-pilot study) but after follow up studies, it was determined that this first batch of shellfish most likely contained an additional unidentified shellfish toxin or contaminant that co-extracted with PTX2-SAs during toxin isolation and purification procedures. This finding highlighted the importance of supporting the inclusion of the mice bioassay in procedures for shellfish toxin testing to enable detection of new toxins, and also highlighted the importance of toxin purification for toxicology studies. A significant rise in malondialdehyde excretion was observed within 24 hours of dosing mice, indicating that the PTX2-SAs may cause damage by lipid peroxidation in vivo. In vitro studies showed HepG2 cells to have cell cycle and gene expression changes within 24 hours of a dose of 800ng/mL PTX2-SAs. Cell cycle arrest was observed at the G2/M checkpoint and gene expression changes included alterations in genes involved in cell cycle control, lipid metabolism and transport, lipid genesis and trace metal transport. Many genes involved in DNA repair processes were moderated at the 24 hour point, but as no apoptosis was observed up to 72 hours post dosing it is a promising indication that any DNA damage that may have been caused by the administration of PTX2-SAs was not lethal, and was able to be repaired. In light of the information provided by toxicology investigations in this PhD, with particular reference to evidence of in vivo lipid peroxidation by raised levels of MDA in mouse urine, and changes in cell cycle distribution and gene expression in a cultured human cell line, it is concluded that there is potential for these toxins to induce biological changes in mammalian cells in vivo and in vitro, and hence potential for PTX2-SAs to cause health effects in humans. During the course of this three-year study, developments in techniques for shellfish toxin identification within our laboratories have revealed that the shellfish responsible for the 1997 NSW poisoning incident contained significant concentrations of okadaic acid acyl esters that were not detected at the time of the NSW incident. Although reportedly less toxic than okadaic acid itself, the OA ester concentrations present may have been sufficient to cause the observed symptoms. It is also theorized that these esters could be hydrolyzed in the human gastro-intestinal tract to release okadaic acid. In the light of this new evidence and with no pathology lesions or symptoms of diarrhoea being observed in PTX2-SA dosing studies with mice, we now believe these OA acyl esters to be the causative agent in the 1997 NSW DSP incident and not the PTX2-SAs. Nothing is currently known of the chronic toxicology of PTX2-SAs and thus their potential implications to public health in the long term cannot determined. The toxicology investigations in this thesis were acute studies, and it has not been established if the observed changes could be repaired or returned within normal limits without the manifestation of illness or disease occurring. Utilizing the acute toxicology information in this thesis, a health risk assessment for consumption of PTX2-SA contaminated shellfish was performed. This risk assessment, employing numerous safety factors essential for an incomplete data set, produced guideline values that are lower than the current recommend concentrations. To date, there has been no solid evidence that PTX2-SAs cause illness in humans &#150; all documented incidents involving the PTX2-SAs have also included other DSP contaminants that are known to cause human illness. Pathology has not unequivocally been demonstrated in animal studies and thus, in consideration of the epidemiological evidence, PTX2-SAs cannot be considered as high a risk to public health as was previously thought. For the reasons discussed above, and weighing up risk-benefit considerations of the economic burden the current guideline values are causing to shellfish industries around the globe, it is recommended that levels of PTX2-SAs be monitored in recognition of the precautionary principle, but no longer regulated as tightly with other DSPs until such a time that toxicological or epidemiological evidence can prove that the PTX2-SAs are a DSP and are a more considerable threat to human health than has been indicated by toxicology studies in this thesis. This study has produced a substantial amount of acute toxicology data and has provided a good basis for future chronic toxicology investigations with the PTX2-SAs for regulatory purposes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pectenotoxins</field><field name="subject">PTX</field><field name="subject">PTXs</field><field name="subject">diarrhetic shellfish poisoning</field><field name="subject">shellfish toxins</field><field name="subject">seco acids</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030905.090222</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ABC Online: Becoming the ABC</field><field name="creator">Burns, Maureen</field><field name="description">This thesis combines histories of the implementation of ABC Online (the website of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Australia's largest national Public Service Broadcaster) with the political philosophies of Foucault, and of Deleuze and Guattari.  Following the Deleuzian argument that institutions of enclosure are in crisis because they exist in between diagrams of the disciplinary and control societies, the thesis tests each of the Foucauldian diagrams of discipline, governmentality and control against the ABC as Public Service Broadcaster. It explores issues such as which ABC strategies belong to which diagram, and the ways in which changes in communications technologies altered governing rationales of these diagrams at the ABC. The thesis uses the implementation of ABC Online to explore the idea of the ABC in the late 1990s as operating in between social diagrams.  One way of examining this 'in between-ness' is to use the Public Service Broadcasting idea as an instance of arboreal thinking and the internet idea as rhizomic. The thesis employs that model to argue that Public Service Broadcasting as it is practised is not merely an arboreal assemblage, and that actual implementations of the internet are more than merely rhizomic assemblages. The thesis details some of the earliest relations between broadcasting and the internet at the ABC, and describes the relations between rhizomic and arboreal images of the ABC at particular sites and in various discourses. This examination concludes that both ways of imagining the ABC - the arboreal and the rhizomic - have been essential to the success of ABC Online. While the position of the ABC in between social diagrams caused a sense of crisis, ABC Online was in fact successful largely because of its position in between social diagrams.  Not only was ABC Online remarkably successful in its first five years, but it was successful in ways which could not be accommodated in such documents as the ABC Charter. The public silences of ABC Online both allowed it to thrive, and conversely supported arboreal stratified ways of defending the ABC. Defences of the ABC that used arboreal thinking as a rhetorical strategy continued to dominate public discussion of the ABC, despite the successes of contrary examples in practice. One such example was the successful implementation of Radio Australia Online at a time when the Mansfield Review sought to limit the scope of the ABC to domestic free-to-air broadcasting. When some ABC Online practices were publicised in relation to the proposed Telstra deal, the resultant controversy concentrated on the non-commercial/commercial boundary at the ABC. The controversy also highlighted fears that the Online environment may alter the ethical relations between the ABC and its publics. In particular, the ethical goals of independence and integrity were perceived as being under threat in the World Wide Web environment. These goals were further problematised within the organisation by the demands of interactive subsites.

Grounded theory methodology was employed to inductively explore the issues siblings perceived to be their main concerns and how they managed these concerns. Fifty-three interviews were conducted recursively with twenty child and adolescent siblings of individuals with an ABI, four adult siblings of individuals with an ABI and four child and adolescent siblings of individuals with congenital disability. Observational and secondary data from hospital staff and parents were also analyzed. The framework was developed and verified through simultaneous data collection and analysis (Glaser, 1978; Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990). The main issue of concern for siblings following their brother or sister's ABI was the loss of equilibrium in their lives. Losing equilibrium was defined by the concepts of vulnerability and emotional turmoil. Specifically, following ABI, siblings were confronted with the vulnerability of their assumptive world, which was influenced by their exposure to unforeseen circumstances, mortality, the enduring nature of their brother or sister&#146;s injury, and the perceived vulnerability of their family unit. In response to these losses, siblings experienced emotional turmoil, including acute anxiety, chronic worry, ambivalent emotions and disenfranchised grief. Losing equilibrium was an ongoing concern for siblings that threatened their sense of security, safety, predictability and control for many years post injury. To manage these ongoing concerns, siblings employed a variety of interrelated strategies to regain equilibrium. These strategies were conceptualized by the concepts, navigating and sacrificing. The purpose of these strategies was to restore safety, predictability and control in the siblings' environment. Navigating required siblings to negotiate the enduring disequilibrium in their lives, by challenging new rules with old tools, withdrawal, trying and buying, merging the familiar and the unfamiliar and integrating. Sacrificing required siblings to relinquish their needs and desires to regain equilibrium and was illustrated through the concepts, surrogate parent, surrendering parental attention, emotional repression, and self-blame. These self-sacrificing strategies appeared to influence siblings' long-term personal development. For instance, siblings believed that they became more responsible, understanding, tolerant, and cautious in everyday activities. The data indicated that these personal changes subsequently maintained siblings sacrificing behaviors. Although sacrificing strategies were employed by some siblings from the time of the ABI, most siblings mastered their loss of equilibrium through the navigating process. Like the non-finite nature of losing equilibrium, regaining equilibrium was an ongoing cyclical process. Rather than focusing on adjustment outcomes only, the current study has extended previous research by providing a framework for understanding the process of sibling adjustment to ABI. This framework provides a set of integrated categories, concepts, hypotheses and propositions to inform future research and practice.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">injury</field><field name="subject">damage</field><field name="subject">child</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">pediatric</field><field name="subject">acquired</field><field name="subject">adjustment</field><field name="subject">equilibrium</field><field name="subject">sibling</field><field name="subject">siblings</field><field name="subject">brother</field><field name="subject">brothers</field><field name="subject">sister</field><field name="subject">sisters</field><field name="subject">adolescent</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">adult</field><field name="subject">adults</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040514.114829</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution and Partitioning of Trace Metals and Tributyltin in Estuarine Sediments</field><field name="creator">Burton, Edward D.</field><field name="description">An improved understanding of the geochemical partitioning of trace metals and tributyltin (TBT) in sediments is of great importance in risk assessment and remedial investigation. The aim of this thesis was to examine the distribution and partitioning behaviour of trace metals and TBT in benthic, estuarine sediments. This was achieved by a series of field- and laboratory-based studies investigating factors controlling the geochemical behaviour of trace metals and TBT in sediments from south-east Queensland, Australia. The distribution and enrichment of selected trace metals in benthic sediments of the Southport Broadwater (a semi-enclosed coastal body of water adjacent to the Gold Coast city, south-eastern Queensland, Australia) was studied. Sediment contamination for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sn and Zn was assessed by (1) comparison with Australian sediment quality guidelines, (2) calculation of the index of geoaccumulation based on regional background values, and (3) geochemical noi-malisation against Al (i.e. the abundance of alumino-silicate clay minerals). Based on this approach, several sites were found to be strongly enriched with Cu, Pb, Sn and Zn, arising from sources related to either urban runoff or vessel maintenance activities. The geochemical partitioning of Cu, Pb and Zn was examined in sediments collected from three of these sites of sediment contamination. Total Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations in coarse-textured (65 to 90 % sand sized particles), sub-oxic sediments (Eh + 120 to +260 mV) ranged from 8.3 to 194 mg/kg for Cu, 16.3 to 74.8 mg/kg for Pb and 30.1 to 220 mg/kg for Zn, and were related to vertical trends in sediment texture. The association of Cu, Pb and Zn with amorphous oxides, crystalline oxides and organic matter was linearly dependent on the abundance of each phase. For retention by amorphous oxide minerals, the trace metal retention ranged from 5.2 to 23.7 mgcjgFe oxide as Fe for Cu, 1 2.8 to 21 .5 mgpb/gFe oxide as Fe for Pb, and 23. I to 85.7 mgm/gFe oxide as Fe for Zn. Corresponding values for association with crystalline oxides were an order of magnitude less than those for amorphous oxides, indicating a weaker affinity of trace metals for crystalline oxides. The relationships describing association with organic matter ranged from 17.6 to 54.0 mgcu/gorg c for Cu, 6.1 to 9.6 mgpb/gorg c for Pb and 6.4 to 16.4 mgzn/gorg c for Zn. The in-situ solid/pore-water partitioning of TBT and the degradation products, dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MBT), was determined for an estuarine sediment profile with previously identified elevated Sn concentrations. Total butyltin levels were (depending on depth) 220 to 8750 jig/kg for TBT, 150 to 5450 jig/kg for DBT and 130 to 4250 jig/kg for MBT. Pore-water butyltin concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 2.35 jig/L for TBT, 0.07 to 3.25 jiglL for DBT, and 0.05 to 0.53 J.tgIL for MBT. The organic carbon normalised distribution ratios (Doc) were similar for TBT, DBT and MBT, and were io to 106 L/kg. Values for the Butyltin Degradation Index (BDI) were larger than I at depths greater than 10 cm below the sediment/water-column interface, indicating that substantial TBT degradation has occurred in the sediments. This suggests that natural attenuation may be a viable sediment remediation strategy. Factors controlling the partitioning behaviour of Cu, Pb and Zn in nonsulfidic, estuarine sediments were examined in controlled laboratory-based studies with the use of combined sorption curve - sequential extraction analysis. This allowed determination of sorption parameters for Cu, Pb and Zn partitioning to individual geochemical fractions. Partitioning behaviour in sulfidic sediments was also determined by sequentially extracting Cu, Pb and Zn from synthetic sulfide minerals, and from natural sediment and pure quartz sand after spiking with acid-volatile sulfide (AVS). Trace metal sorption to the 'carbonate' fraction (pH 5, NaOAc extraction) increased with metal loading due to saturation of sorption sites associated with the 'Fe-oxide' (NH2OH.HCI extraction) and 'organic' (H202 extraction) fractions in non-sulfidic sediments. Freundlich isotherm parameters describing sorption to the 'Fe-oxide' and 'organic' fractions were dependent on the sediment Fe-oxide and organic carbon content, respectively. Sequential extraction of Cu from pure CuS, AVS-spiked sediment and AVS-spiked quartz sand showed that AVS-bound Cu was quantitatively recovered in association with the 'organic' fraction. However, some AVS-bound Pb and Zn were recovered by the NH2OH.HCI step (which has been previously interpreted as 'Fe-oxide' bound metals) in the sequential extraction procedure used in this study. This indicates that the sequential extraction of Pb and Zn in sulfidic sediments may lead to AVS-bound metals being mistaken as Fe-oxide bound species. Caution should therefore be exercised when interpreting sequential extraction results for Pb and Zn in anoxic sediments. Tributyltin (TBT) sorption to four natural sediment samples in artificial seawater was also examined under a range of modified pH and salinity conditions in controlled laboratory-based studies. Three of the sediment samples were relatively pristine with regard to TBT contamination, but the fourth was a TBT-contaminated sediment from a commercial marina. Sorption of TBT was described well by linear sorption isotherms, with distribution coefficients ranging from 6.1 to 5210 L/kg depending on pH and salinity. Sediment organic C content and particle size distribution were important determinants of sorption behaviour. The presence of resident TBT in the contaminated marina sediment caused a substantial reduction in TBT sorption due to satuaration of high selectivity sites. Desorption of TBT from the marina sediment was described by relatively large observed distribution coefficients ranging from 5100 to 9400 L/kg, suggesting that aging effects may reduce sorption reversibility. Increased artificial seawater salinity generally reduced TBT sorption at pH 4 and pH 6, but enhanced TBT sorption at pH 8. Regardless of salinity, maximum sorption of TBT was observed at pH 6, which is attributed to an optimal balance between abundance of the cationic TBT species and deprotonated surface ligands. Consideration of aqueous TBT speciation along with octanol-water partitioning behaviour suggest that hydrophobic partitioning of TBTCI to non-polar organic matter was important for pH (up to) 6, whilst partitioning of TBTOH was important at higher pH. The effect of aging on the solid/pore-water partitioning and desorption behaviour of TBT in sediments was examined. Three sediment samples with contrasting physical and chemical properties were spiked with 10 mg/kg TBT and aged under sterile conditions for periods of time ranging from I to 84 days. Aging had a negligible effect in a sandy sample with very low organic carbon content (0.2 % w/w). In contrast, for samples with larger amounts of organic carbon (2.6 and 4.8 % w/w), the effect of aging on the solid/pore-water partitioning behaviour was significant. For these samples, the apparent distribution coefficients (Ks) obtained from sequential two hour desorption experiments exhibited a two-fold increase between spiked sediments subjected to aging for 1 day and 84 days. This study demonstrates that aging effects may be an important aspect of TBT fate in contaminated sediments. Overall, the results described in this thesis demonstrate that environmental factors (i.e. pH, salinity, Eh, aging) and sediment composition (i.e. abundance of fine alumino-silicate minerals, organic matter, Fe-oxides, reactive sulfides) exert substantial effects on trace metal and TBT partitioning. The current reliance on measurement of total trace metal and TBT concentrations in contaminated sediment management may consequently lead to inaccurate estimates of environmental risk and inappropriate remediation measures if other factors regulating contaminant distribution and partitioning are ignored.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trace metals</field><field name="subject">tributyltin</field><field name="subject">estuarine sediments</field><field name="subject">Southport Broadwater (Queensland)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050830.161359</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Blonde Paradox: Power and Agency Through Feminine Masquerade and Carnival</field><field name="creator">Burton, Laini Michelle</field><field name="description">Blonde hair is a potent and highly visible sign in western culture. Although the popularity and desirability of blonde hair in the West is well documented, since the 1950s, blonde hair has also generated many negative associations and these have contributed to myths around blondeness. In particular, women who dye their hair blonde find themselves in a paradoxical position; they simultaneously evoke desire and derision. This thesis uses the model of feminine masquerade outlined by Joan Riviere (1929) as a locus for discussing the transgressive potential of the knowing use of blondeness as a sign. When women wear blondeness in this way they embrace it as an oblique means to access privilege. This self-reflexivity allows women to enter sites of power that they are otherwise excluded from. Drawing on ideas of the carnivalesque, as described by Mikhail Bakhtin (1968), this thesis also proposes that the carnivalesque is employed by women in order to transgress patriarchal boundaries through an ironic masquerade of the archetypal blonde. These paradoxical meanings of blondeness are evoked in the work of performance artist Vanessa Beecroft. Beecroft stages both the reflexive awareness of today's blonde woman and the way in which she is shaped by socio-cultural forces beyond her control. Through reference to Beecroft's art, this dissertation builds upon the optimism and transgressive potential of Bakhtin's 'carnival' and Riviere's 'feminine masquerade' to re-present the identity/position of blonde women as one of agency and power.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blonde hair</field><field name="subject">feminine masquerade</field><field name="subject">blondeness as a sign</field><field name="subject">Vanessa Beecroft</field><field name="subject">carnivalesque</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070122.110616</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Relational Outcomes on Customer Loyalty</field><field name="creator">Butcher, Kenneth John</field><field name="description">Customer loyalty in services is the focus of the research. The research problem sought to determine both indirect and indirect effects of relational outcomes on customer loyalty, conceptualised as a psychological state. Relational outcomes are defined as: the thoughts, feelings, and relationships perceived by customers arising from the interaction with a service employee. This class of variable is differentiated from other relational factors such as the characteristics of the actors in the interaction and their behaviours. The effects of relational outcome antecedents were compared to service evaluation antecedents such as customer satisfaction, quality, and value. Customer loyalty was modelled as a psychological state and grounded in the unique characteristics of services. The pioneering work of Kingstrom (1983) was used as a basis for extending the literature. Customer loyalty is an important variable for both services marketing researchers and industry. Accordingly, the research was justified on both theoretical and managerial grounds. Four factors inspired the identification of the research gap: a lack of service loyalty research grounded in service characteristics, lack of studies that conceptualised loyalty as a psychological state, inadequacy of service evaluation measures to predict customer loyalty, and the perceived importance of social interaction to service outcomes. Data collection included pilot studies, re-analysis of published literature, and three major studies. In the first major study, 23 informants provided insights into the nature of three specific relational outcomes: friendship, social comfort, and social regard. The second study was a cross-sectional survey of 190 hair-dressing customers. The specific relationships between friendship, social regard, social comfort, value for money, service encounter satisfaction, perceived core service quality, and customer loyalty were established in this study. New scales were also developed for friendship, social regard, social comfort, and customer loyalty. A third study collected survey data from 406 customers of hairdressing salons, cafes, and naturopathic clinics. Hypothesised relationships were tested through three nested structural equation models. The results indicate that relational outcomes in general are important to customer loyalty. Their effects on loyalty as a psychological state are both direct and indirect. The strength of the effects of relational outcomes on loyalty compares favourably with the effects of service evaluation measures on loyalty. The construct of friendship between individual customer and service employee was found to be related significantly and positively with customer loyalty. The effect of personal friendship appears to have as strong an effect as perceptions of core quality and service encounter satisfaction. Another major finding was that the two relational outcomes of social comfort and social regard both had an indirect influence on customer loyalty. This effect was mediated through the service evaluation constructs of perceived core service quality and service encounter satisfaction. Social comfort affected both quality and satisfaction whereas social regard only influenced quality. However, the impact of social regard on core quality was substantial. Friendship was not found to have a significant relationship with either quality or satisfaction. These findings suggest that there is a temporal dimension to the influence of relational outcomes. Both social regard and social comfort appear to be more important in the early stages of customer-service provider interaction. It also appears that customers evaluate the core quality of everyday services such as hair salons, cafes, and naturopaths using social cues such as feeling well regarded. A further major finding was the lack of a significant relationship between value for money and psychological loyalty in both quantitative studies. Effects of quality, satisfaction, and friendship appear to be important to loyalty development whereas customer value is not. This finding suggests that value for money may be related directly to actual purchase behaviour or repurchase intentions rather than mediated through psychological feelings of loyalty. Hence, evaluations which reflect pricing considerations are less likely to be associated with psychological loyalty than more relationally oriented constructs. The findings indicate important implications for both marketers and researchers. Marketing strategists need to be clear about pursuing either a loyalty or a value for money strategy. The former may not result from the latter. Relational outcomes lead to psychological loyalty but their interactive effects operate differently. Friendship with a service employee provides a direct contribution to loyalty development. Whereas social regard and social comfort affect customers' evaluation of the service. Pursuing a relational strategy will have implications for the way frontline staff are selected and trained. Theoretical implications include: using the relational outcomes as a basis for middle range theory development, support for the linear-additive measurement approach, use of laddering techniques to determine relevant influencing variables, and additional explanatory power to the service recovery literature. In conclusion, a unidimensional construct of psychological loyalty, grounded in service characteristics, was developed, tested, and evaluated for wide application to service industries. Three specific relational antecedents: Friendship, social regard, and social comfort were found to be important to the development of customer loyalty. The research highlighted how these relational outcomes interacted with service evaluation measures to produce loyal customers. Accordingly, Kingstrom's (1983) work has been extended.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer loyalty</field><field name="subject">relational outcomes</field><field name="subject">social comfort</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050914.140054</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Law and the Social Production of Space</field><field name="creator">Butler, Christopher</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationship between law and space by focusing on the role of the land-use planning system in producing the space of Australian urban regions.  The primary aim of the project is to demonstrate the significance of the theoretical and sociological framework of Henri Lefebvre for an emerging field of socio-legal studies concerned with the relationship between law and geography. To this point very few contributions to this field have considered the theoretical connections between law and space in any depth.  This thesis demonstrates how Lefebvre's sophisticated theory of the socially produced nature of space can broaden the scope of 'law and geography' research.  It does so through a detailed survey of Lefebvre's work and a deployment of his ideas in a series of inquiries into the production of space in Australia.  This endeavour is pursued in two stages.  Part I of the thesis begins by examining how explanatory models within the social sciences have become increasingly concerned with the spatial dimensions of social life.  This 'spatial turn' is reflected in a small, but growing literature within socio-legal studies which focuses on the interdisciplinary connections between law and geography.  However the theoretical foundations of this field remain underdeveloped.  Through an analysis of Lefebvre's writings, this thesis identifies an anti-reductionist methodological approach to space and its social production.  This is used to establish a theoretical framework for the study of the spatial dimensions of law. Part II of the thesis uses this framework to address two questions about the law-space relationship. The first of these is concerned with how law is involved in the production of space.  This is considered through three linked studies of the production, planning and legal regulation of space.  The starting point for this investigation is the geographical site of suburbia.  Lefebvrean categories are used to redescribe Australian suburbia as a form of abstract space - simultaneously fragmented, homogeneous and hierarchically organised.  The thesis then argues that the land-use planning system in the post-war decades played a significant role in the development of this form of settlement space, by adhering to a form of bureaucratic thinking that Lefebvre characterises as the rationality of habitat.  This rationality embodied technocratic functionalism, a visualised formalism and a structural imposition of expert authority in planning decision-making.  With the shift to a neoliberal state form in the last two decades, there have been significant changes to spatial planning.  Through an analysis and critique of the Integrated Planning Act 1997 (Qld), it is demonstrated that under neoliberalism there has been a reformulation of the rationality of habitat.  In particular, the Integrated Planning Act relies on two new formal strategies, the exchange form and the integrative form, in instituting its changes to planning practice.  The exchange form abolishes the technique of land-use 'zoning' and increases the use of market mechanisms in the designation of spatial uses.  The integrative form restructures the relationships between local and State government agencies and attempts to channel most forms of public participation into the early stages of policy formation.  This thesis argues that rather than changing the spatial outcomes of land-use planning, by commodifying space and restructuring the hierarchies of state decision-making, the Integrated Planning Act will continue to reproduce the social relations of abstract space. The second question in Part II deals with how Lefebvre's ideas can contribute to critical thinking about public law in general.  It is argued that while law plays a significant role as a producer of space through the planning system, processes of spatial production also shape and structure state institutions.  Two areas of research which could benefit from a Lefebvrean theoretical framework are identified.  The first area concerns explanations of the effects on public law of the reterritorialised state form that has emerged under neoliberalism.  The second is the renewal of critical theory in public law.  In particular, the thesis makes the case that the spatial contradiction between the use and exchange values that are attached to space, challenges the normative orthodoxy within public law scholarship which relies on the values of participation and accountability. This thesis contributes to socio-legal research in three important ways.  Firstly, it uses Lefebvre's theoretical approach to develop a critical planning law, linking state planning to the process of the production of space.  Secondly, the thesis uses Lefebvrean categories to link the study of public law to political struggles which surround spatial production.  It suggests a new way for critical legal scholarship to conceptualise public law in terms of the relationship between state power and the inhabitance of space.  Lastly, these inquiries demonstrate the importance and relevance of Lefebvre's social theory for the discipline of socio-legal studies.  By grounding the concept of 'space' in material processes of production, a Lefebvrean approach provides an alternative to existing theoretical accounts within law and geography research and will deepen our understanding of the relationships between legal and spatial relations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">land-use planning</field><field name="subject">urban planning</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Henri Lefebvre</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">spatial</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040521.141805</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local Source Influences Upon the Structure of Dust Plumes in the Channel Country of Western Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Butler, Harry</field><field name="description">Most of the early wind erosion research undertaken in Australia, concentrated on how wind erosion affects cultivated farm land. However, in the 1990's the focus of wind erosion research in Australia started to shift to include rangeland environments. Initially these rangeland experiments used experimental configurations that were developed for cultivated fields. This meant that in most cases a sampler was set up in the middle of a field and it was assumed that the data collected was representative of the field as a whole. It was also assumed that temporal changes in dust fluxes/concentration reflect overall changes in the land type erodibility and wind erosivity. However, recent experiments and field observations within the rangelands, of the Channel Country suggest that this assumption is not valid. These experiments and observations suggest that there are substantial spatial and temporal variations in erodibility within individual land types. Such variations complicate the interpretation of temporal and spatial erosion trends. In particular, this variability implies that it is difficult to compare sampler data between different wind erosion events. To begin quantifying and comparing sampler data between events within the rangeland environments, the Dust Source Interaction Simulation Model (DSism) was developed to simulate the effect that physical processes and spatial variations in erodibility have upon observed dust concentration pro- files. The modelling/simulation approach used is closely linked to experimental data via the extensive use of sensitivity testing. Another key feature of the DSism approach, is its flexibility in allowing different dust source areas to have particle emission characteristics. This combined sensitivity testing and simulation approach has provided new insights into the wind erosion processes. By using DSism, it has been possible to identify several key features of the wind erosion process within rangeland environments. The first observation is that spatial and temporal changes in erodibility produce distinct changes in both the vertical and crosswind dust concentration profiles. Further investigations, indicate that the dispersion processes in operation vary from event to event. In particular, the results presented here indicate that surface heating plays an important role in some wind erosion events. These results also suggest that even small variations in the vertical dust concentration profile can reflect temporal and spatial changes in processes and erodibility.  Finally the simulation results show that the particle size distribution of a vertical dust concentration profile depends on (a) the processes in operation during a given event and (b) the spatial variation in the particle size emission characteristics of the various source areas. These findings have several important implications. In particular, they indicate that both the crosswind and vertical dust concentration profiles can be viewed as amalgamation of several distinct plumes from different dust source areas and that dust concentration profiles contain significant information about both the spatial distribution of sources and the processes in operation during any given event. Most field studies have used regression models to describe the variation in dust concentration with height. A problem with this approach is that it assumes that the variation in dust concentration with height, always has a given functional form (or shape) and that dust concentration always decreases with height. Field observations, indicate that this assumption is only valid for some events within rangeland environments and that dust concentration does not always decrease with height in these environments. In most cases, such variations from the regression fit have been assumed to be the result of experimental 'noise' (error) or spatial variations in erodibility. This thesis presents, modelling and field evidence, which suggests that such variations, are the result of a combination of spatial variations in erodibility and changes in thermal conditions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dust plumes</field><field name="subject">Queensland Australia</field><field name="subject">wind erosion</field><field name="subject">Dust Source Interaction Simulation Model</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051103.155627</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industrial Relations Processes in Registered Clubs of NSW</field><field name="creator">Buultjens, Jeremy</field><field name="description">The small business sector has become an increasingly important segment of the Australian economy since the 1970s. Industrial relations in the sector have been assumed to be harmonious. However, to a large extent this belief about industrial relations is based on conventional wisdom rather empirical evidence.  Industrial relations research in Australia has concentrated on medium to large businesses because the centralised nature of the industrial relations system encouraged a collective emphasis. This collective emphasis ensured peak representative bodies and larger organisations had a tendency to dominate while small enterprises and their employees were, to a large extent, excluded.  The perceived non-problematic nature of industrial relations in the small business sector was another reason for the lack of focus on the sector.  The low incidence of strike activity and the low levels of trade union membership have meant research has been concentrated on the more "difficult" areas of industrial relations.  The lack of empirical research into industrial relations in the sector is an important shortcoming. There are a number of commentators who suggest that it is too simplistic to assume harmonious relations. It is likely that there is a range of industrial relations in small business, depending on a number of variables including the personality of the owner/manager and employees, the type of business and the current economic climate. The legislative framework will also have an important affect on industrial relations.  This study addresses the lack of empirical research in industrial relations in the small business sector by examining the differences between small and large registered clubs in NSW. Registered clubs have an unusual ownership structure and unusual business goals.  They are also unusual since they are non-profit organisations formed by groups of people who share a common interest and who have come together to pursue or promote that interest. Registered clubs are governed by a board of directors who are responsible for the formulation of policy and for ensuring that management carries out these policies.  This study found that there were significant differences in regards to some aspects of employment relations.  For example, small clubs were more likely to have lower rates of unionisation than large clubs.  They were also likely to have lower levels of informal bargaining than large clubs.  The methods of communication within the workplace were likely to be more informal in small clubs and they were less likely to have communications with a trade union. Despite this greater degree of informality in employment relations, small clubs were more likely to use award provisions to determine wages for their managers and employees.  Interestingly, despite the lower level of unionisation and the greater use of awards by smaller clubs there were no significant differences between small and large club managers' perception of the impact of awards and trade unions on club flexibility. The findings from this study suggest the deregulation of the Australian industrial relations system may not have any significant benefits for small business.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">registered clubs</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">industrial relations</field><field name="subject">workplace relations</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">small businesses</field><field name="subject">small enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040514.140227</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Alignments in Ritual, Ceremony and Celebration</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Roger Neil</field><field name="description">Increasingly, cultural workers and artists from many disciplines are finding themselves involved in the creation of public and private rituals, ceremonies and celebrations. Focusing on ritual and celebration in Australian contexts, this thesis posits a new categorisation of the types of event that might be encountered, grouping and examining them according to their action upon participants with the aim of enabling a more practical methodology of design in contemporary societal conditions. Existing categories, which have defined these age-old activities in terms of anthropological observation or social intention, must now be regarded as obsolete because they take no account of rapid and widespread changes in degrees of adherence to traditional belief systems, in social orientation and in Western cultural practices. There is a need to reappraise why individuals and communities might continue to hold rituals and celebrations, and how these can be designed, managed and operated most effectively.  The thesis identifies four major categories of ritual: Transformation, Reinforcement, Transcendence and Catharsis. It argues that, by recognising the differences between how each category operates for participants and also certain commonalities across categories, effectiveness of design is facilitated. In developing parameters for each category and giving examples of contemporary praxis, the writer stresses the importance of understanding traditional ceremonies so that elements of a rich repertoire of techniques developed over long periods can be planned into new rituals for contemporary application, despite the dissipation of shared, coherent belief systems in a highly secularised culture. This impels consideration of questions of cultural sensitivity, raises the need for close community involvement in design, and requires exploration of managing the challenges of multiple signification. Contemporary cultural contexts for ritual and celebratory events are marked by plurality, multi-vocalism and multicultural experience. Designers thus need to achieve, out of difference, an event that produces coherence, deep effects for each participant and a sense of shared experience. The thesis demonstrates means to this end through informed praxis, that is, by practitioners ensuring that theory and practice are working together in these complex contexts that involve the well being of individuals and communities. The categories have been identified through investigations into the literature of myth, ritual and celebration, helpful frameworks developed in cognitive science, and extensive research provided by thirty years of practice in the field. As a designer and director of rituals and celebrations, the writer seeks both to confirm the importance of the artist within the process and to demonstrate a new, practical, ethically located and effective approach for the education of intending practitioners. No claim is made that the four categories are definitive or mutually exclusive of one another. It is accepted that in many situations the categories might coalesce, be added to and/or fragment. However, the categorisation provides a fresh vantage point from which to view the potentially powerful effects of ritual experience, an effective tool of construction for the use of artists and cultural activists working in this field, and an informed basis for praxis. In developing this new categorisation the writer argues an ongoing need for rituals and celebrations to clarify and enrich the lives of individuals and the community while stressing the importance of careful and appropriate design of such events.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ritual</field><field name="subject">rituals</field><field name="subject">belief systems</field><field name="subject">beliefs</field><field name="subject">celebration</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">West</field><field name="subject">Western</field><field name="subject">myth</field><field name="subject">mythology</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050627.105721</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flow Variability and Vegetation Dynamics in a Large Arid Floodplain: Cooper Creek, Australia</field><field name="creator">Capon, Samantha Jane</field><field name="description">Throughout arid and semi-arid inland Australia, many extensive floodplains occur in association with rivers which are amongst the most hydrologically variable in the world.  As rainfall in these areas is characteristically low and patchy, conditions in Australia's 'dryland' floodplains fluctuate unpredictably between extended periods of drought and huge floods that transform vast areas into wetlands, often for months at a time.  Vegetation in these floodplains is commonly dominated by short grass and forb associations and patches of open succulent shrubland which are attributed with high ecological and socio-economic values due to their provision of habitat to a diverse array of terrestrial and aquatic fauna and their productive native pasture growth.  In temperate and tropical floodplains, a substantial number of studies have shown that plant community composition and structure is determined primarily by flow and alterations to flow in these areas, through water extraction or river regulation, have resulted in many changes to the vegetation including loss of biodiversity and mass invasions of exotic species.  Despite increasing pressure for water resource development in 'dryland' regions, relatively little is known regarding the effects of highly variable flows on the vegetation dynamics of arid floodplains, particularly in Australia.  This thesis addresses this knowledge gap by examining the role of flow in the vegetation dynamics of a large arid floodplain in central Australia: the Cooper Creek floodplain.  The effects of flow on plant community dynamics, from an organism level to that of the landscape, are examined across a range of spatial and temporal scales.  Results are presented from a two year temporal vegetation survey during which time two flood pulse events of differing sizes occurred.  A large-scale spatial survey was also conducted to determine the effects of flood history on spatial variation in plant community composition and structure.  The composition of the soil seed bank and its contribution to vegetation dynamics were additionally investigated through a series of germination trials.  Amongst common arid floodplain plants, life history traits that enable persistence under variable hydrological conditions were also considered via several experiments aimed at determining the effects of flow on the outcomes of various life history stages including germination, growth and dispersal.  Throughout the study, results are presented for plant groups that were predefined on the basis of life form, life span and taxonomic divisions within these categories.  Plant community composition and structure in the Cooper Creek floodplain exhibits significant shifts both temporally, in response to flood pulse wetting and drying, and spatially, in response to flood history.  Flood pulse inundation has the potential to influence each life history stage across the range of plant groups present and the outcomes of these appear to be determined by hydrological attributes such as flood pulse timing, duration and rate of drawdown.  Vegetation consequently exhibits gradual zonation on a gradient of flood frequency along which plant groups occur at predictable locations depending on their life history traits and recent hydrological conditions.  A substantial proportion of species display ruderal life history traits including large, persistent soil seed banks and rapid life cycles which enable escape in time from the stresses associated with flooding and drought.  These species, mostly comprising annual monocots and forbs, are widespread throughout the landscape and their presence in the extant vegetation is related primarily to the time since the last flood pulse event and the hydrological attributes of this.  Perennial species, particularly shrubs, do not appear to rely similarly on the soil seed bank for recruitment and their distribution in the floodplain vegetation is likely to be determined more by their ability to tolerate either flooding or drought.  Overall, this study demonstrates that flow, despite its variability, has an overriding influence on vegetation dynamics in the arid floodplain of the Cooper Creek.  The spatial and temporal variability of flow maintains a heterogeneous mosaic of plant communities of differing composition and structure.  Given this close relationship between flow and vegetation dynamics, anthropogenic alterations to flow are likely to result in changes to the vegetation including homogenisation of plant communities across the floodplain landscape and eventual loss of biodiversity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">stream flow</field><field name="subject">river</field><field name="subject">rivers</field><field name="subject">stream</field><field name="subject">streams</field><field name="subject">floodplain</field><field name="subject">floodplains</field><field name="subject">arid</field><field name="subject">vegetation</field><field name="subject">plant communities</field><field name="subject">germination</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">dispersal</field><field name="subject">variable</field><field name="subject">variability</field><field name="subject">soil seed banks</field><field name="subject">drought</field><field name="subject">flood</field><field name="subject">flooding</field><field name="subject">dryland</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Cooper Creek</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040513.110733</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Contemporary and Historical Processes on Population Genetic Structure of Two Freshwater Species in Dryland River Systems (Western Queensland, Australia)</field><field name="creator">Carini, Giovannella</field><field name="description">Arid and semiarid river systems in Western Queensland, Australia, are characterized by the unpredictable and highly variable nature of their hydrological regimes as a result of the episodic nature of rain events in the region. These dryland rivers typically experience episodic floods and extremely low or no flow periods. During low or no flow periods, water persists only in relatively wide and deep sections of the river channels, which are called 'waterholes'. These isolated waterholes serve as refugia for aquatic species during protracted intervals between floods. In such discontinuous riverine habitat, dispersal of freshwater species may be achieved only during wet seasons, when water is flowing in rivers and the nearby floodplains. Obligate aquatic species occur in habitats that represent discrete sites surrounded by inhospitable terrestrial landscapes. Thus, movements are very much limited by the physical nature and arrangement of the riverine system. In addition, the distribution of a species may be also largely dependent on historical events. Landscape and river courses continually change over geological time, often leaving distinct phylogenetic 'signatures', useful in reconciling species' biology with population connectivity and earth history. The main aim of this study was to resolve the relative importance of contemporary and historical processes in structuring populations of two freshwater species in Western Queensland river systems. To address this aim, a comparative approach was taken in analysing patterns of genetic variation of two freshwater invertebrates: a snail (Notopala sublineata) and a prawn (Macrobrachium australiense). Mitochondrial sequences were used for both the species. In addition, allozyme and microsatellites markers were employed for N. sublineata.  These species have similar distributions in Western Queensland region, although N. sublineata appears to be extinct in some catchments. M. australiense is thought to have good dispersal abilities due to a planktonic larval phase in its life cycle and good swimming capabilities, whereas N. sublineata is thought to have limited dispersal abilities, because of its benthic behaviour and because this species is viviparous. It was hypothesised that these freshwater invertebrates, would display high levels of genetic structure in populations, because physical barriers represented by terrestrial inhospitable habitat, are likely to impede gene flow between populations inhabiting isolated river pools. Genetic data for the two species targeted in this study supported this hypothesis, indicating strong population subdivision at all spatial scales investigated (i.e. between and within catchments).  This suggests that contemporary dispersal between isolated waterholes is relatively restricted, despite the potential good dispersal abilities of one of the species. It was hypothesised that levels of gene flow between populations of aquatic species were higher during the Quaternary (likely movements of individuals across catchment boundaries) and that they have been isolated relatively recently. There is evidence that historically gene flow was occurring between populations, suggesting that episodic dispersal across catchment boundaries was likelier in the past. Episodic historical movements of aquatic fauna were facilitated by higher patterns of river connectivity as a result of the climate changes of the Pleistocene. Because the two species targeted in this study exhibit analogous spatial patterns of evolutionary subdivision it is likely that they have a shared biogeographic history. The unpredictable flow regime of rivers in Western Queensland is likely to have considerable effects on the genetic diversity of aquatic populations. First, if populations of obligate freshwater organisms inhabiting less persistent waterholes are more likely to experience periodic bottlenecks than those inhabiting more persistent ones, they would be expected to have lower levels of genetic diversity. Second, if populations inhabiting less persistent waterholes periodically undergo local extinction with subsequent recolonisation, there should be higher levels of genetic differentiation among them, due to the founder effects, than among those populations inhabiting more persistent waterholes. Contrary to the first prediction, the observed levels of genetic diversity in both N. sublineata and M. australiense were high in both more persistent and less persistent waterholes. There was no tendency for genetic diversity to be lower in less persistent than in more persistent waterholes. However, when Cooper waterholes were ranked in order of persistence, positive correlation between water persistence time in waterholes and genetic diversity was detected in N. sublineata but not in M. australiense. Contrary to the second prediction, highly significant genetic differentiation was found among populations from both less persistent and more persistent waterholes. This indicates that not only populations from less persistent but also those from more persistent waterholes were very dissimilar genetically.  This study demonstrated the importance of both contemporary and historical processes in shaping the population structure of obligate freshwater species in Western Queensland river systems. It has indicated that contemporary movements of freshwater species generally are extremely limited across the region, whereas episodic dispersal across catchment boundaries was possible during the Pleistocene, due to different patterns of river connectivity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dryland rivers</field><field name="subject">arid rivers</field><field name="subject">semiarid rivers</field><field name="subject">river</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">freshwater invertebrates</field><field name="subject">Notopala sublineata</field><field name="subject">Macrobrachium australiense</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050113.081250</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Analysis of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer</field><field name="creator">Carless, Melanie</field><field name="description">Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer in the world with a lifetime risk for development as high as 2 in 3 in Queensland, Australia. Mortality is quite low, representing an approximate 360 deaths in Australia annually but cost of treatment is extremely high, estimated at $232 million each year. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are the two most common forms of NMSC. Although BCC generally do not have the propensity to metastasise, they are highly invasive and can be locally destructive. SCC on the other hand is invasive and has metastatic potential. SCC is generally derived from a precursor lesion, solar keratosis (SK), which is also considered to be a biomarker of BCC, SCC and malignant melanoma. According to one theory, SKs actually represent the first recognisable stage of SCC development and therefore may be indicative of the earliest stage of NMSC development. In addition to these common forms of NMSC, rarer forms such as keratoacanthoma (KA), which spontaneously regress, and SCC in situ, which rarely become invasive, may provide clues into protective mechanisms associated with prevention of development. Like all other cancers, NMSC arises from an accumulation of genetic abnormalities that result in severe cellular dysfunction. A number of genes have been proposed in the development of NMSC, including p53, CDKN2a, Bcl-2 and the Ras family of genes, which are typically associated with proliferative and differentiation processes. Also, a number of genetic disorders that predispose individuals to NMSC have also been identified. Genetic abnormalities in these genes may be a result of somatic mutations that may be promoted by environmental carcinogens. For NMSC, ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the primary environmental stimulus that acts upon skin to generate mutations. UV effects are 2-fold; the first being direct damage produced by UVB radiation and the second being indirect damage as a result of UVA-induced oxidative stress. In addition to mutations of genes that directly result in carcinogenesis, polymorphic variants of genes may also play a role in susceptibility to NMSC. These susceptibility genes may have immunogenic, detoxifying or transcriptional roles that could be involved in increased mutagenesis or activation of cancer causing genes. The purpose of this study was ultimately to identify further molecular based mechanisms associated with the development of non-melanoma skin cancer. Initially, this study aimed to examine the effects of aberrant chromosomal regions on NMSC development and also to identify candidate genes within these regions that may be implicated in the development and progression of NMSC. Also, based on chromosomal and functional implications, a number of candidate genes were assessed using association analysis to determine their involvement in susceptibility to the earliest stages of NMSC development. Implicated susceptibility genes were then further investigated to determine their response to UV radiation. Therefore the methodological approach of these studies was based on three broad technical applications of cytogenetic, association and expression analyses. Previous comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) studies implicated the 18q chromosomal region in progression of SK to SCC and this region was therefore suspected of harbouring one or more tumour suppressor genes that were associated with a more malignant phenotype. Following on from this analysis, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis was used for further delineation of this region and possibly to implicate candidate genes involved in progression. Additionally, CGH was used to investigate keratoacanthoma to determine aberrant regions that might be involved in progression and also regression of this NMSC. Genes that had potential functional roles in NMSC development and that were located in or near regions implicated by these cytogenetic analyses were further investigated using association analysis. Association analysis was performed using polymerase chain reaction and subsequent restriction enzyme digestion or GeneScan analysis to determine genotype and allele frequencies in an SK affected versus control population for polymorphisms within a number of candidate genes. This population was carefully phenotyped so that not only genotypic factors could be analysed but also their interaction with a number of phenotypic and environmental risk factors. Genes with polymorphisms that did show association with solar keratosis development were then examined functionally. Specifically, gene expression analysis was undertaken to investigate their response to UV radiation. Both UVA only and combined UVA/UVB treatments were used for short term irradiation and also for long term irradiation with recovery to determine differential effects of UV range and dose in human skin. Relative mRNA expression analysis of these genes was performed using quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to determine if UV radiation imposed gene expression changes in the skin. A combination of these methodologies provided a wide basis for investigation of NMSC. Cytogenetic, association and expression analyses all allow for the identification of molecular risk factors that cause or are associated with NMSC development and progression. These analyses provided diverse results that implicated various molecular mechanisms in the development of NMSC. Cytogenetic analysis is a powerful technique, especially for the identification of a broad range of aberrations throughout the genome. This study employed LOH analysis to investigate an implicated region involved in progression to SCC and to attempt identification of candidate genes that may be involved in this process. LOH analysis was successfully performed on 9 SCCs, 5 SCCs in situ and 2 SKs using 8 microsatellite markers within the 18q region. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify polymorphic regions of these markers and genotypic composition was determined for normal and cancerous tissue within the specimen. In heterozygote individuals, determined by analysis of normal tissue, the cancerous tissue was examined to determine if alleles within the implicated region had been lost. However, after analysis of multiple different samples, there was no LOH detected in any of the samples examined for this analysis. This does not necessarily reject a role for 18q, or genes within this region, as the localisation of candidate tumour suppressor genes within a small region may indicate a tighter region of involvement than was expected. As such, a more targeted study may further delineate this region and implicate candidate genes in progression of SK to the more malignant phenotype of SCC. Further CGH analysis of keratoacanthoma was also undertaken to identify aberrations associated with development and also regression of this skin cancer. CGH was performed using universal amplification and nick translation to incorporate a fluorescent dye. Differentially labelled normal and tumour DNA were then competitively hybridised to a normal metaphase spread and fluorescence emission indicated either amplification or deletion of specific chromosomal regions. In total, 6 KA samples were analysed, with 2 samples each from evolving, matured and regressing stages of KA development. In general, regressing KAs appeared to be more highly associated with deleted regions than evolving and matured KAs. Specifically, the 15q chromosomal region that was deleted in regressing KAs but amplified in evolving or matured KAs, may be significantly involved in the process of KA regression. Also various candidate genes that were being considered for analysis were located in or near some of these implicated regions, including GSTM1, GSTP1 and SSTR2. As such, these candidate genes were targeted for further investigation. A number of susceptibility genes that were located in or near aberrant regions implicated in NMSC development were investigated using association analysis. These genes included members of the somatostatin receptor family (SSTR1 and SSTR2), members of the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) family (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 and GSTZ1) and the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Studies detected a number of interesting interactions between genetic, environmental and phenotypic factors in the development of the early stages of non-melanoma skin cancer. Additionally, genes implicated in NMSC development were further investigated using expression analysis to determine response to UV radiation. Association analysis was initially performed on members of the somatostatin receptor family. Somatostatin is a growth inhibiting factor, amongst other things, that mediates its actions through the somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). The presence of these receptors (SSTR1-5) in tumour cells indicates a potential for somatostatin to bind and suppress growth, as well as allowing for therapeutic treatment with somatostatin analogues. Additionally, expression of these receptors in normal tissue, including skin, should allow for potential protection against tumour growth. The genes for SSTR1 and SSTR2 have been shown to contain dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms, and although these polymorphisms may not directly result in altered expression or binding potential, they may be linked to another functional polymorphism that does. Using association analysis the SSTR1 and SSTR2 genes were investigated to determine whether they play a role in the development of solar keratosis. Results showed that there were no significant differences between SSTR1 and SSTR2 polymorphism frequencies in the tested solar keratosis population (P = 0.10 and P = 0.883, respectively) as compared to an unaffected population. Hence, these studies do not support a role for the SSTR1 or SSTR2 genes in solar keratosis development. Further association analysis and subsequent expression analysis was also performed on members of the glutathione-S-transferase family. The GST enzymes play a role in the detoxification of a number of carcinogens and mutagens, including those produced by UV-induced oxidative stress. This study examined the role of GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 and GSTZ1 gene polymorphisms in susceptibility to SK development. Association analysis was performed to detect allele and genotype frequency differences in SK affected and control populations using PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. No significant differences were detected in GSTP1 and GSTZ1 allele or genotype frequencies, however polymorphisms within both genes were found to be in linkage disequilibrium, as previously reported, and a new allelic variant of the GSTZ1 gene was identified. Significant associations between GSTM1 (P = 0.003) and GSTT1 (P = 0.039) genotypes and SK development were detected, with the null variants of both genes conferring an approximate 2-fold increase in risk for solar keratosis development (OR: 2.1; CI: 1.3-3.5 and OR: 2.3; CI: 1.0-5.0 for GSTM1 and GSTT1, respectively). For the GSTM1 gene, this risk was significantly higher in conjunction with high outdoor exposure (OR: 3.4; CI: 1.9-6.3) and although the GSTT1 gene showed a similar trend (OR: 2.9; CI: 1.1-7.7), this did not reach significance. The increased risk of SK development associated with these genes is likely due to a decreased ability of the skin to detoxify mutagenic compounds produced by UV-induced oxidative stress, and hence a decreased ability to protect against carcinogenesis. Implication of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null variants in solar keratosis development prompted interest in analysis of gene expression changes in response to UV radiation. Due to the high homology of the GSTM1 gene with other GSTM genes, and therefore potential issues with primer specificity, the GSTT1 gene was focussed on for the expression studies. Real time reverse transcription PCR, incorporating SYBR green fluorescence and 18S as a comparative gene, was used to study GSTT1 gene expression changes in response to both UVA and combined UVA/UVB radiation. It was found that only short term UV radiation had an effect on GSTT1 expression changes, whereas no alteration of gene expression was seen after 4 and 12 hours of recovery from long term irradiation between irradiated and matched non-irradiated skin samples. This indicated that changes in gene expression for the GSTT1 gene apparently occur relatively quickly after exposure to UV radiation. Analysis of both UVA only and combined UVA/UVB short term irradiation indicated that an initial decrease in expression, followed by an increase was likely to represent translation into protein and subsequent transcription of mRNA, and in some cases a second decrease indicated further translation. Hence, it appears as though UV radiation does have a significant effect on the expression of at least one GST gene, and that UV radiation in combination with genetic variation of these genes may play a role in the development of NMSC. Finally, association and subsequent expression analysis was also performed on the vitamin D receptor. The hormonal form of vitamin D, 1a25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, has been shown to have numerous cancer-related effects, including antiproliferative, differentiation, proapoptotic and antiangiogenic effects. These effects are mediated through the binding of 1a25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 to the vitamin D receptor and subsequent transcriptional pathways. Polymorphisms within the VDR are known to regulate its transcription and therefore expression, which is linked to the ability of 1a25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 to bind. Association analysis of a 5&#146; initiation codon variant (Fok I) and two 3&#146; variants (Apa I and Taq I) was performed in SK affected and control populations. Although the Fok I variant showed no association with SK development, both the Apa I and Taq I variants were found to be associated with SK development (P = 0.043 and P = 0.012, respectively). In particular, the Aa and Tt genotypes were associated with increased risk of SK. These results were however more complicated, as shown by further analysis. This showed that genotypes containing at least one allele that conferred decreased VDR transcription (ie. AA/Aa and Tt/tt) increased risk of SK development by 2-fold in fair skinned individuals (OR: 2.1; CI: 1.2-3.7 and OR: 1.7; CI: 1.1-2.7 for Apa I and Taq I variants, respectively) but also found to decrease the risk of SK development by 2-fold in medium skinned individuals (OR: 0.5; CI: 0.3-1.0 for Apa I variants). Additionally, genotypes containing 2 alleles conferring decreased transcription of the VDR gene were found to further increase the risk for SK development in fair skinned individuals (OR: 2.5; CI: 1.4-4.5 and OR: 2.4; CI: 1.2-5.0 for Apa I and Taq I variants, respectively), indicating a possible additive effect for the alleles. The highly differential association of the VDR gene polymorphisms amongst phenotypes may reflect a combination between the ability of an individual to synthesise 1a25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 with the binding availability of the VDR. To further investigate the role of VDR in NMSC, expression analysis of the VDR gene was undertaken using real time reverse transcription PCR, with SYBR green fluorescence and 18S as a comparative gene, to examine expression pattern changes associated with UV radiation. It was found that short term irradiation, as well as long term irradiation and recovery were associated with gene expression changes. Short term irradiation resulted in patterns indicative of translation and subsequent transcription, whereas long term irradiated samples resulted in reduction of VDR expression that was recovered after an extended period of time. Thus, VDR expression is clearly influenced by UV exposure. It would be very interesting to see more specifically if particular VDR genotypes, which appear to play a role in NMSC risk, also are affected differentially by UV exposure. It is possible that VDR expression is reduced to limit excessive binding of 1a25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, although since both UVA and UVB radiation affect VDR expression, this may not be mediated the effect of 1a25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 but rather a different pathway resulting from a general UV response. In summary, the detection of a number of susceptibility genes involved in SK development and their subsequent expression analysis in response to UV radiation has given further insight into the molecular changes associated with NMSC. In fact, both detoxification genes (GSTM1 and GSTT1) and a transcription related gene (VDR), were found to confer susceptibility to solar keratosis, an early stage skin lesion with tumourigenic potential. This suggests that even the earliest stages of skin cancer are mediated through a wide range of effects. Additionally, expression changes related to these genes indicate that they are associated with the well known environmental carcinogen of UV radiation and that their effects may be mediated through a wide range of pathways. Although implication of the 18q region in SCC progression was not confirmed in this study, it is still likely to play a role in malignant transformation. The implication of this region, as well as the implication of susceptibility genes has vastly increased knowledge into processes associated with NMSC. Although additional analysis can confirm and further implicate these molecular alterations, this study has resulted in a more comprehensive understanding of NMSC that may ultimately be of benefit in terms of prognosis and treatment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">skin cancer</field><field name="subject">non-melanoma skin cancer</field><field name="subject">squamous cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">basal cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">molecular analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041101.123114</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Servicing the Subject: a Feminist Re-appraisal of Prostitution</field><field name="creator">Carpenter, Belinda</field><field name="description">This thesis examines theoretical and popular ways of knowing the prostitute and the client. Its purpose is to intervene in contemporary ways of knowing and articulate a more consistent feminist stance on prostitution. Currently, the prostitute is known predominantly through the discourse of psychology whilst the client is known through the discourse of sexology. She is deviant and he is normal. She is a victim and he is an agent. The issue of inconsistency in the feminist stance on prostitution is related to the recognition that these dualisms figure in the way in which all knowledge of the client and the prostitute is organised. Within feminist theory the prostitute is known through the dualism of victim and agent whilst the client is known through the sex/gender distinction. The former perpetuates certain ways of knowing the prostitute that cannot embrace the complexity and ambivalence of prostitution for women. If she is a victim she is only passive and exploited. If she is an agent she is both active and free. Utilising the latter allows the client to escape scrutiny. This thesis will argue that this is for two reasons. Firstly, because feminists have tended to support the idea of the prostitute as agent within the victim/agent dichotomy. Within such a way of knowing, any critique of the client became a critique of the livelihood of the prostitute, and is best avoided. Secondly, because feminists tend to work within the sex/gender distinction and its associated dualisms of mind and body, nature and culture. As such, they tend to perpetuate, rather than challenge, the sexological relationship between the sexual and the social. In both analyses, the sexual urge is ultimately natural, albeit modified by society. Analyses that argue for the social constitution of sexuality (rather than simply its social construction) still perpetuate the sex/gender distinction by claiming the validity of the mind/body dualism for their analyse. This thesis will argue that these dualisms structure an impossible choice for feminists and help to position them within the divisive prostitution debate. In a political climate that perpetuates only two ways of knowing prostitution, to critique prostitution is to be anti-sex, moralising, prudish and conservative. In contrast, to support prostitution is hailed as pro-sex, pro-women and pro-choice. Within this dichotomising of the political issue, feminists gain either conservative or libertarian allies. Within such a political climate, a consistent feminist position is lost. In order to counter this political and theoretical inconsistency, this thesis argues for a connection between the dualisms through the organisation of modern liberal democracies. To know the prostitute through the victim/agent dichotomy and the client through the sex/gender distinction (and associated dualisms of mind and body, nature and culture) is also to call upon the public/private split as their organising feature. The public/private split gives meaning to the dualisms of victim and agent, sex and gender, mind and body, through its role in the perpetuation of associations between victim, body, sex, private and women, and between agent, gender, mind, public and men. This thesis will argue that these dualisms are not useful for explaining the ambivalent and contradictory status of prostitution as both work and sex, public and private, rational and irrational, embodied and disembodied, sexual and social. However, not only does prostitution challenge the explanatory value of these dualisms, but the experience of prostitution for the prostitute and the client both subverts and inverts these dualisms. The usual configuration of the dualisms public/private, worker/consumer, male/female, mind/body, rationality/irrationality, are public, worker, male, mind, rationality, in contrast to private, consumer, female, body, irrationality. The prostitute is positioned in and through modern liberal democracies as embodied, but claims the status of worker through her experience of disembodiment. The client is positioned in and through modern liberal democracies as disembodied, and continues this proprietorial relationship with his body during the prostitution contract. She becomes the embodied worker and he becomes the disembodied sex partner. This further demonstrates the inability of a dualistic conception of prostitution to take into account the ambivalent and contradictory status of the prostitute and the client. Whilst this thesis will suggest that such an ambivalent status is to be found in all relations between men and women in modern liberal democracies, it will also propose the political implications of this theoretical reconfiguration for the feminist position on prostitution.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prostitution</field><field name="subject">feminist theory</field><field name="subject">dualism of victim</field><field name="subject">dualism of agent</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051109.134329</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing Their Own Affairs: The Australian Deaf Community During the 1920s and 1930s</field><field name="creator">Carty, Bridget Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development of and interrelationships among organisations in the Australian Deaf community during the early part of the 20th Century, particularly during the 1920s and 1930s.

These developments within the Deaf community were influenced by wider social movements in Australian society during these decades, such as the articulation of minority groups as 'citizens', and their search for 'advancement', autonomy and equal rights. Australia's first schools and post-school organisations for Deaf people were closely modelled on 19th Century British institutions. The thesis describes the development of these early Australian institutions and argues that Deaf people had active or contributing roles in many of them. During the early 20th Century most of these organisations came under closer control of hearing people, and Deaf people's roles became marginalised. During the late 1920s many Deaf adults began to resist the control of Societies and Missions, instead aspiring to 'manage their own affairs'. In two states, working with hearing supporters, they successfully established alternative organisations or 'breakaways', and in another state they engaged in protracted but unsuccessful struggles with the Deaf Society. Australian Deaf people established a national organisation in the 1930s, and this led to the creation of an opposing national organisation by the Societies. Most of these new organisations did not survive beyond the 1930s, but they significantly affected the power structures and relationships between Deaf and hearing people in Australia for several decades afterwards. These events have been largely ignored and even strategically suppressed by later generations, possibly for reasons which parallel other episodes of amnesia and silence in Australian history.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian deaf community</field><field name="subject">Deaf Societies</field><field name="subject">minority groups</field><field name="subject">hearing impaired</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060123.131332</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Internal Functioning of Cross-Functional Teams: A Social Identity Theory Based Process</field><field name="creator">Cassematis, Peter</field><field name="description">Cross-functional teams are becoming increasingly common in organisations.  However, a large proportion of these teams fail to meet their full potential as social and productive units. The present research was conducted under the assumption that a cross-functional team involves simultaneous intragroup and intergroup contact.  The failure of cross-functional teams often involves the neglect of normal social psychological processes that occur in intergroup contexts that may potentially be employed to increase the likelihood of success with cross-functional teams.  The social identity theory approach to intergroup relations was used to formulate two identity management strategies intended to improve the functioning of a cross-functional team.  One strategy involved social interaction within an intragroup social frame.  The intragroup aspect was apparent in that there was no outgroup present, with participants operating at the intergroup level of psychological processing after exposure to (successful) pre-task manipulations intended to facilitate acceptance of the task group social identity. The intragroup identity management process required increasing pre-task salience of the task group social identity, absence of any outgroup, wearing a team uniform, and performance of an intellectually challenging problem solving as a group.  A second identity management process was based in an intergroup social frame.  The intergroup procedure involved pre-task manipulation of social identity, wearing of a team uniform, and performance of a physically and intellectually involving problem solving task in a competitive intergroup social frame.  Two separate studies were performed. In Study one, 110 university students were randomly assigned to 'mono-functional' teams (teams with no obvious basis for internal intergroup differentiation).  The relative efficacy of either of the two identity management processes was assessed with regards to changes in social identity, subjective uncertainty, conceptualisation of the aggregate, similarity, heterogeneity, effort, and trust.  Pre-post within groups differences were analysed Improving functioning of cross-functional teams by repeated measures ANOVA.  Between groups differences were analysed with ANCOVA.  The results indicated both identity management strategies resulted in improved team functioning. In general, neither strategy was notably superior to the other, however there was less subjective uncertainty reported by participants from the intragroup condition than those from the intergroup condition due to the effect of losing the competition.  Participants from losing teams also became more aware of 'subgroups within the single group' than those from the intragroup condition.  Participants from the intergroup condition were less likely to think of themselves as separate individuals than participants from the intragroup condition.  The social identity theory approach to intergroup relations was useful for interpreting the results as well as developing the two strategies which suggests SIT/SCT provide a potentially useful conceptual base from which to develop team building processes in mono-functional teams. In study 2, 110 university students were assigned to cross-functional teams (composite task groups containing three academic subgroups).  The identity management processes used in Study one were extended by drawing participant attention to the presence of subgroups within the cross-functional teams.  The intragroup process involved pre-task manipulation of social identity, wearing uniforms which denoted both task group and subgroup membership, and performance of an intellectually challenging problem solving task which was performed with out an outgroup present.  The intergroup identity management strategy involved pre-task manipulation of social identity, performance of a physically and intellectually involving problem solving task requiring integration of subgroup knowledge and inter-functional cooperation within a competitive intergroup context.  As in the intragroup condition, participants were made aware of the social complexity of the task group through their uniforms.  Participants responded differently to the two identity management processes, with the intergroup strategy proving more beneficial than the intragroup strategy.  The intragroup process was marked by non-significant pre-post differences, indicating neither Improving functioning of cross-functional teams a marked improvement nor decline in group functioning.  In contrast, participants from the intergroup condition reported results indicating increased post-task self-definition with the cross-functional team, increased trust, and higher effort.  Losing the competition did not impact on post-task levels of any dependent variable with the exception of subjective uncertainty, where 'winners' reported less uncertainty than 'losers'.  The intergroup condition gave rise to the most potential perceived 'distinctiveness threat'; however there was no sign of any threat across the array of dependent variables.  Therefore it can be suggested that the intergroup identity management strategy provided some protection to the cross-functional team from the negative impact of inter-functional distinctiveness threat.  All results could be explained with recourse to the concepts of SIT/SCT which suggests social identity theory has utility for interpreting results as well as developing team building processes in cross-functional teams.  Future research in cross-functional team settings would benefit from the development of comprehensive measures of uncertainty, status, and heterogeneity with item content drawn from social identity and self-categorisation theories.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cross- functional teams</field><field name="subject">intragroup contact</field><field name="subject">intergroup contact</field><field name="subject">social identity</field><field name="subject">self-categorisation theories</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070710.134636</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative Analyses of Successful Establishment Among Introduced Land Birds</field><field name="creator">Cassey, Phillip</field><field name="description">Humankind has redistributed a large number of species outside their native geographic ranges. Although the majority of introduction attempts fail to establish populations, the cumulative negative effect of successful non-native species has been and will continue to be large. Historical records of land bird introductions provide one of the richest sources of data for testing hypotheses regarding the factors that affect the successful establishment of non-native populations. However, despite comprehensive summaries of global avian introductions dating back two decades only very recent studies have examined the successful establishment of non-native bird species worldwide. It is clear that a non-random pattern exists in the types of land bird species that have been chosen by humans to be introduced outside their native range. Out of the 44 avian families from which species have been chosen for introduction almost 70% of introduction attempts have been from just five families (Phasianidae, Passeridae, Fringillidae, Columbidae, Psittacidae). Notably, these families include game species, insectivorous song birds, and species from the pet trade. It has been hypothesised that the fate of introduced species may be determined in part by heritable characteristics that are shared by closely related taxa. In my analyses, I have used current comparative methods to demonstrate that intrinsic eco-physiological characteristics are significant predictors of the worldwide success of introduced land bird species. The results of my analyses contribute to a greater ecological understanding of the traits that correlate with the successful establishment of non-native species. Notably, the three major conclusions that I have drawn from this thesis are: 1. Non-random patterns of successful establishment exist for introduced land bird taxa that have experienced a repeated number of introduction attempts. This result supports the idea that introduced species have an inherent likelihood of either succeeding or failing to establish non-native populations. 2. Eco-physiological traits are important correlates for determining the variability in introduction outcome for non-native land bird species. With reliable information on introduction attempts and taxa-specific traits predictive models are possible that quantify the outcome of repeated introduction attempts across non-native species. 3. Islands are not universally less resistant than mainland regions to the successful establishment of non-native species. This perception is a reflection of the greater number of introduction attempts to islands rather than an effect of biotic resistance. Any differences in the success of introduction attempts can be attributed largely to differences in the proportion of introductions that have been made across biogeographic regions. I have highlighted that data are accessible for global analyses of the variability in the successful establishment of non-native species. Although establishment success is not a deterministic process, the characteristics of an introduced species can influence the probability of its succeeding. I have shown that with adequate eco-physiological information, and for introduced land bird species at least, this probability can be predicted. These results refute previous suggestions that the stochastic component of species introductions will always overshadow any emerging patterns of successful establishment among non-native populations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">introduced species</field><field name="subject">introduced animals</field><field name="subject">introduced birds</field><field name="subject">non-native species</field><field name="subject">non-native animals</field><field name="subject">non-native birds</field><field name="subject">biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030915.094001</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Evaluation of Software Development Practice and Assessment-Based Process Improvement in Small Software Development Firms</field><field name="creator">Cater-Steel, Aileen Patricia</field><field name="description">As software becomes increasingly important to all aspects of industry, there is a need to encourage practitioners to adopt best practice so as to improve the quality of the processes in use, and therefore achieve targets relating to time, budget and quality.  The software development industry in Australia is dominated by a myriad of small firms.  This presents a challenge in terms of determining the current practices of industry participants, and in devising improvement initiatives which are feasible for small organisations.  Currently, the level of adoption of best practice among local software developers is unknown.  To help improve the software industry, it is necessary to determine the current status of use of practices and techniques.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of assessment-based software process improvement for small organisations needs to be evaluated.  The objective of this research is to understand the extent of software development practices currently in use, and to evaluate the effectiveness of assessment-based software process improvement initiatives for small firms. To achieve this objective, an extensive mail survey of the Queensland software industry was conducted to identify and compare best practice in software development with current practice.  The survey was based on the software best practice questionnaire used by the European Software Institute.  Following on from this, a detailed evaluation of a process improvement program in 22 small firms was carried out.  The program used the Rapid Assessments for Process Improvement for software Development (RAPID) model and method.  RAPID is based on ISO/IEC 15504 (SPICE) and includes eight processes: requirements elicitation, software development, configuration management, quality assurance, project management, problem resolution, risk management, and process establishment.  The evaluation analysed the process capability of the firms as reported from one-day software process assessments and also the extent of improvement as recorded at follow-up meetings held 7 to 16 months after the assessment.  Both quantitative and qualitative techniques were used to analyse the assessment reports. The study confirmed that there is wide variation in the extent of adoption of software development best practice in terms of the individual practices, as well as the organisations.  While project management planning and customer involvement practices are widely adopted, the use of metrics for estimating and testing are barely used by the organisations that responded to the survey.  Overall, practices of a technical nature are more widely adopted compared to techniques related to support and management.  Organisations involved in developing commercial off-the-shelf software have higher adoption than firms which do not develop such systems, and adoption of best practice is associated with the size of the development group.  The leaders in adoption have significantly better practices when compared to the laggards for 40 of the 44 practices included in the survey.  Furthermore, organisations from the finance, insurance and utilities sectors exhibited higher adoption of best practice compared to organisations from other sectors.  The overall adoption of 48 percent implies that the organisations which responded have adopted, on average, almost half of the best practices in the questionnaire.  While this overall adoption rate places the Queensland software industry in a competitive position compared to adoption of firms in European countries, there is scope for improvement. The process improvement assessments of 22 firms also confirmed that the capability of technical processes is higher than that of management processes; and suggested that higher capability is associated with the proportion of experienced staff and the proportion of staff with post graduate qualifications.  Higher process capability is also associated with firms undertaking projects of lengthy durations.  Most of the processes were rated at the lowest levels. Almost one third of all the processes were rated as incomplete (level 0) and 46 percent were rated as performed (level 1). The evaluation of the process improvement program was conducted by analysing the 22 assessment reports, and the 20 final reports from the follow-up meetings.  The extent of improvement is associated with the proportion of technical staff and the proportion of formally qualified staff.  The evaluation revealed that assessment-based process improvement programs are effective for small firms, regardless of the maturity of the processes at the time of the assessment.  As well as detailing the process capability of 22 small software firms, this study provides an interesting insight into the actions, reasons for inaction, and reactions of the firms as far as implementing the recommendations from the assessments.  Analysis of the reactions of the participants of this program suggests that for small firms, mentoring, training and organisation stability are important factors, while senior management support may not be an issue of concern. The study indicates that small firms can benefit from a low cost process improvement program with a restricted scope, a short time frame to evaluation, and mentoring from external assessors/consultants.  It is also crucial that the firm is not disrupted by internal or external events during the course of the software process improvement program.  Furthermore, this study provides a contribution to assessment methods by validating the RAPID model and method, and providing recommendations to improve the RAPID method.  The outcomes from this research have the potential to better equip practitioners and consultants to undertake software process improvement, hence increasing the success of small software development firms in domestic and global markets.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software evaluation</field><field name="subject">software development practice</field><field name="subject">software development firms</field><field name="subject">Queensland software industry.</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060110.180345</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of Sources of PM2.5 and PM10 Aerosols in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Chan, Yiu-chung</field><field name="description">Urban health problems and visibility degradation problems are associated with particulate matter in the air, especially PM10 and PM25 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 j.tm and 2.5 jsm, respectively). The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics and sources of PM25 and PM20 aerosols in Brisbane. This study collected aerosol samples over a period of two and a half years at five sites around Brisbane. Source samples of soil dusts, road-side dusts and sea salt were also collected and analysed to provide information on source emission composition. The aerosol samples were analysed by a wide range of techniques, including Ion Beam Analysis and Scanning Electron Microscopy, for their chemical composition and particle size distribution. Some methodologies have been specifically developed in this study. The results presented here show that the chemical composition of PM20 aerosols in Brisbane varies largely with particle size and locations. The chemical composition of the samples are generally related to the land use near the monitoring sites. On average, the major components in the PM10 aerosol samples at five sites in Brisbane were identified as: crustal matter (27% by mass), organic matter (16%), sea salt (12%), soot (11%), and ammonium sulphate (7%). Among the Australian studies, in general, the results show that the composition of the PM25 aerosol samples collected at the Griffith University site (Brisbane) is closest to those of the New South Wales samples. The samples from Melbourne and Perth are generally richer in industry-and vehicle-related species. The major components of the PM25 aerosols at the GU site were identified as: organic matter (27% by mass), elemental carbon (23%), ammonium sulphate (14%), sea salt (9%) and crustal matter (6%). The results show that contribution of emission sources also has large particle size, temporal and spatial variations. Based on the results of source apportionment from the chemical mass balance method, the major contributors of PM20 aerosol mass in samples collected at five sites in Brisbane were found to include: soiL/road-side dusts (25% by mass, results of analysis also indicate a higher contribution from road-side dusts than from soil dusts), motor vehicle exhausts (13%, more than 80% of which are from diesel trucks/buses), elemental carbon and secondary products (around 15%), sea salt (12%), Ca/Ti-rich compounds from cement plant and mineral processing industries (11%), and biomass burning and bioaerosols (7%). On average, the PM25 aerosol mass at the Griffith University (GU) site was found to have contributions mainly from sources related to combustion. These sources include elemental carbon (24% by mass), secondary organics (21%), biomass burning (15%) and secondary sulphate (14%). Although motor vehicle exhausts contribute directly to only 6% of the PM25 aerosol mass at the GU site, their actual contribution could be substantial because most of the elemental carbon and secondary products are related to motor vehcile exhausts. On average, the results show that the visibility degradation problems in Brisbane are worse in winter/autumn than in summer. Soot and sulphate particles are the main visibility degrading species. In terms of visibility degrading sources, the main contributors are (excluding the contribution of NO2 gas): motor vehicles (up to 50%, including the secondary products), secondary sulphates (17%) and biomass burning (10%). In general, emission sources which contribute more to the fine particle fraction, and to gaseous pollutants, are most responsible for the aerosol associated health problems and visibility degradation problems. In Brisbane, these sources include motor vehicle exhausts, soil dusts, biomass burning and industrial dust.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Particulate matter in air</field><field name="subject">aerosols</field><field name="subject">air pollution</field><field name="subject">Brisbane (Qld.)</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050906.093804</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-Regulation and Wisdom in Relationship Satisfaction</field><field name="creator">Charker, Jillian H</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a program of research which aimed to explore the role of relationship self-regulation (or relationship "effort") and wisdom in relationship satisfaction.  Three separate studies were conducted to examine the association between self-regulation and satisfaction, and the mechanisms for this association.  Study 1 examined self-regulation, wisdom and satisfaction, using a sample of 61 couples in long-term relationships, and found that while wisdom shared little association with satisfaction, self-regulation was a significant correlate of satisfaction for men and women.  Study 2 examined whether the association between self-regulation and satisfaction was mediated by communication skills in a sample of 101 couples in the early stages of their relationship.  Results replicated the self-regulation/satisfaction association found in Study 1, but provided no evidence for mediation by communication.  Study 3 tested for mediation of the self-regulation/satisfaction association by attributions in a sample of 73 newly-wed couples.  The association between self-regulation and satisfaction was partially mediated by attributions, but self-regulation also had a direct relationship with satisfaction.  It was concluded that self-regulation is an important correlate of satisfaction in relationships, and that this association cannot be fully explained by communication or attributions.  Several directions for future research were provided, including the need to examine self-regulation and its predictors longitudinally, ways in which a behavioural measure of self-regulation could be developed, and the implications of self-regulation for couple therapy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">relationship self-regulation</field><field name="subject">relationship effort</field><field name="subject">relationship satisfaction</field><field name="subject">couples</field><field name="subject">couple relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030912.150523</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lawyer Problem Solving: An Investigation of the Knowledge Used in Solving Practical Legal Problems</field><field name="creator">Chay, Allan James</field><field name="description">This study investigates the knowledge that legal practitioners use to solve authentic practical legal problems in naturalistic settings. The study examines the declarative and procedural knowledge that practitioners use in that context and whether experienced practitioners use knowledge organised in encapsulated and script form (Boshuizen &amp; Schmidt, 1992; Schmidt, Norman, &amp; Boshuizen, 1990) to enable &#145;expert&#146; performance. The purpose of the study is to provide an empirically-based understanding of the knowledge used in solving real-life practical legal problems, for the information of the providers of practical legal training in Australia and other common law countries. The providers of that training use assumptions about that knowledge and how it is acquired, which do not always rest on coherent theoretical or empirically-derived foundations. The study uses the lawyering literature to identify the knowledge such literature considers is required to solve practical legal problems in lawyer and client interview settings. The study also examines the assumptions about the nature of that knowledge, and how it is acquired, which are apparent in the approaches of the providers of practical legal training. The limitations of those assumptions are identified from a cognitive perspective.  The study examines cognitive conceptions of the knowledge used in problem solving in particular fields and how that knowledge becomes proceduralised and organised into structures called chunks and schemas. A particular examination is made of cognitive theories developed in the field of medical problem solving, which use the concepts of &#145;encapsulations&#146; and &#145;illness scripts&#146; to explain &#145;expert&#146; performance in diagnosing disease in clinical settings.  This analysis is used to synthesise the prediction that experienced legal practitioners may develop and use structures similar to encapsulations and illness scripts in problem solving.  This prediction is based on the similarities between the way medical practitioners and legal practitioners are educated and trained, and are taught to solve problems using a hypotheticodeductive method (or a domain variant in the case of law), and on the similarities between clinical settings and lawyer and client interview settings.  The study also examines theories that explain human problem solving by reference to a metaphorical &#145;problem space&#146;, and synthesises the prediction that practical legal problem solving can be explained by a problem space theory that was developed to accommodate complex, ill-defined problems. That theory uses the concepts of a problem zone to reflect the ill-defined nature of the problem as presented to the problem solver, a search and construction zone to reflect the phenomenon that the problem solver will have to construct operators to use to solve the problem, and a satisficing zone to reflect the phenomenon that there will be no single unambiguous solution to the problem (Middleton, 1998).  The study uses the lawyering literature to identify the characteristics of practical legal problems in a lawyer and client interview setting. The cognitive literature is used to identify the cognitive conceptions that correspond to those characteristics. It is argued that these problems are complex, ill-defined problems that have to be found by the problem solver using weak problem solving strategies such as problem decomposition, attribute identification and means-ends analysis (Simon, 1973; Dillon, 1982; Newell, 1980).  Based on these predictions two research questions are developed as follows: How do legal practitioners find and construct practical legal problems? Are there differences in the knowledge that experienced legal practitioners use and that which novice practitioners use? Do those differences reflect differences in the individual practitioner&#146;s underlying knowledge and how that knowledge is organised?  These questions are investigated in four case studies. Two of these studies involve experienced legal practitioners and two involve novices. These studies reveal that all the subjects used similar general problem solving strategies to find and construct problems. The subjects all constructed a series of problems rather than one large problem. The subjects did not all find and construct the same problems and some subjects&#146; constructions of problems changed as new information came to light. Most subjects did not finish the construction of problems at the interview. The processes that the subjects use to construct problems can be explained by Middleton&#146;s (1998) problem space model, although this study suggests that model needs to be modified to accommodate the on-going emergent character of practical legal problems as they occur in lawyer and client interview settings.  The investigation revealed qualitative differences between the problem attributes and moves that the experienced subjects identified and those that the novices identified. In summary, the experienced subjects identified attributes and moves that were more detailed, more directly related to the &#145;facts&#146; and more concrete than those that the novices identified. Both the experienced subjects and the novices appeared to rely on recognition (Newell &amp; Simon, 1972) to identify problem attributes and moves rather than on any apparent step-by-step legal analysis and reasoning process. This study suggests that the superior performance of the experienced subjects may be explained by their use of knowledge in encapsulated and script form, as predicted.  The study discusses the implications of its findings for practical legal training courses as a need to provide students with general problem solving knowledge, provide them with the knowledge that they will need to recognise problems in specific areas of practice, to help them start to develop knowledge in encapsulated and script form, and to develop an understanding of the limits of institutional training in developing professional expertise.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">legal practitioners</field><field name="subject">practical legal problems</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">common law</field><field name="subject">legal training</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070927.100346</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamical Near Optimal Training for Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network (T2FNN) with Genetic Algorithm</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Martin Chun-Sheng</field><field name="description">Type-2 fuzzy logic system (FLS) cascaded with neural network, called type-2 fuzzy neural network (T2FNN), is presented in this paper to handle uncertainty with dynamical optimal learning. A T2FNN consists of type-2 fuzzy linguistic process as the antecedent part and the two-layer interval neural network as the consequent part. A general T2FNN is computational intensive due to the complexity of type 2 to type 1 reduction. Therefore the interval T2FNN is adopted in this paper to simplify the computational process. The dynamical optimal training algorithm for the two-layer consequent part of interval T2FNN is first developed. The stable and optimal left and right learning rates for the interval neural network, in the sense of maximum error reduction, can be derived for each iteration in the training process (back propagation). It can also be shown both learning rates can not be both negative. Further, due to variation of the initial MF parameters, i.e. the spread level of uncertain means or deviations of interval Gaussian MFs, the performance of back propagation training process may be affected. To achieve better total performance, a genetic algorithm (GA) is designed to search better-fit spread rate for uncertain means and near optimal learnings for the antecedent part. Several examples are fully illustrated. Excellent results are obtained for the truck backing-up control and the identification of nonlinear system, which yield more improved performance than those using type-1 FNN.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interval type-2 FNN</field><field name="subject">fuzzy neural networks</field><field name="subject">fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">dynamic optimal learning rate</field><field name="subject">back propagation</field><field name="subject">backpropagation</field><field name="subject">genetic algorithm</field><field name="subject">genetic algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030722.172812</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silicon Carbide as the Nonvolatile-Dynamic-Memory Material</field><field name="creator">Cheong, Kuan Yew</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of three main parts, starting with the use of improved nitridation processes to grow acceptable quality gate oxides on silicon carbide (SiC)[1]&#150;[7], to the comprehensive investigation of basic electron-hole generation process in 4H SiC-based metal&#150;oxide&#150;semiconductor (MOS) capacitors [8], [9], and concluding with the experimental demonstration and analysis of nonvolatile characteristics of 4H SiC-based memory devices [10]&#150;[15]. In the first part of the thesis, two improved versions of nitridation techniques have been introduced to alleviate oxide-growth rate and toxicity problems. Using a combination of nitridation and oxidation processes, a sandwich technique (nitridation&#150;oxidation&#150;nitridation) has been proposed and verified to solve the lengthy and expensive oxide-growing process in direct nitric oxide (NO) gas [1]. The nitrogen source from the toxic-NO gas has been replaced by using a nontoxic nitrous oxide (N2O) gas. The best combination of process parameters in this gas is oxide-growing temperature at 1300oC with 10% N2O [2], [3]. The quality of nitrided gate oxides obtained by this technique is lower than the sandwich technique [6], [13]. Using 4H SiC-based MOS with nitrided gate oxides grown by either of the abovementioned nitridation techniques, the fundamentals of electron-hole generation have been investigated using high-temperature capacitance&#150;transient measurements. The contributions of carrier generation, occurring at room temperature, in the bulk and at the SiC&#150;SiO2 interface are evaluated and compared using a newly developed method [8], [9]. The effective bulk-generation rates are approximately equal for both types of nitrided oxides, whereas the effective surface-generation rates have been shown to exhibit very strong dependencies on the methods of producing the nitrided gate oxide. Based on analysis, the prevailing generation component in a SiC-based MOS capacitor with nitrided gate oxide is at SiC&#150;SiO2 interface located below the gate. Utilizing the understanding of electron-hole generation in SiC, the nonvolatile characteristics of memory device fabricated on SiC have been explored. The potential of developing a SiC-based one-transistor one-capacitor (1T/1C) nonvolatile-dynamic memory (NDM) has been analyzed using SiC-based MOS capacitors as storage elements or test structures. Three possible leakage mechanisms have been evaluated [10]&#150;[16]: (1) leakage via MOS capacitor dielectric, (2) leakage due to electron-hole generation in a depleted MOS capacitor, and (3) junction leakage due to generation current occurred at a reverse-biased pn junction surrounding the drain region of a select metal&#150;oxide&#150; semiconductor field&#150;effect&#150;transistor (MOSFET). Among them, leakage through capacitor oxide remains an important factor that could affect the nonvolatile property in the proposed device, whereas others leakage mechanisms are insignificant. Based on the overall results, the potential of developing a SiC-based 1T/1C NDM is encouraging.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silicon carbide</field><field name="subject">microelectronics</field><field name="subject">microelectronic engineering</field><field name="subject">MOSFET</field><field name="subject">MOSFETs</field><field name="subject">NDM</field><field name="subject">nitriding</field><field name="subject">nitridation</field><field name="subject">metal oxide semiconductors</field><field name="subject">metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050115.101233</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bionomics of Culicoides molestus (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae): a pest biting midge in Gold Coast canal estates</field><field name="creator">Chitra, Eric</field><field name="description">Culicoides molestus (Skuse) is the major species of biting midge that plagues human comfort in the estuarine Gold Coast region of southeast Queensland. Local authorities have initiated a search for an effective, non-chemical means of control, that would minimize human-midge interaction. The effectiveness of a program to control an organism, such as a biting midge, is dependent upon knowledge of the biology of the particular organism of interest.  This project revolved examines the lifecycle of C. molestus in detail. It addresses questions regarding the location, seasonal distribution, and dispersal of its juvenile stages in the sand of infested beaches, and their response to chemical treatment, the monthly and annual cycles of the adult midge, and the possibilities of achieving laboratory oviposition, as a first step to laboratory colonisation.  The distribution of eggs, larvae and pupae of C. molestus was found to be mostly concentrated around, but below, mean tide level. They also occurred well below the mean tide level. Eggs and larvae have been recovered from as deep as 10 cm in the sand. A seasonal study of the juveniles of this species indicated that they were more strongly influenced by tides than seasons.  After a routine pest-control larviciding treatment, a beach recolonisation study revealed that beaches become suitable for oviposition approximately two months after treatment. Large larvae invaded the sprayed areas within days of treatment, which suggests the existence of a refuge outside of the reach of the insecticide. Larvae found in clean (egg- and larva-free), isolated sand containers, placed on the study beach, indicated that larvae could swim in or on the water as a way of moving around the beach. Extended bite-rate studies highlighted the existence of four peaks in adult midge biting activity during the course of a year, around the mid seasons. The strongest peaks of activity were found to be in autumn and spring, but the data suggest that the species undergoes four generations in a year.  Through a series of trial-and-error experiments, oviposition under laboratory conditions was achieved. Although the time from blood-feeding to egg maturation is not yet well determined, it occurs within an eight day mean survival period. Blood quality appears critical for adult blood-fed midge survival. Midges fed on the blood of a volunteer who was frequently exposed to midge bites do not live long enough to mature its eggs. The partial ovarial development of one unfed adult female, reared in the laboratory, indicates that C. molestus is facultatively anautogenous.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Culicoides molestus</field><field name="subject">biting midges</field><field name="subject">Ceratopogonidae</field><field name="subject">life-cycle</field><field name="subject">lifecycle</field><field name="subject">distribution</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">insect control</field><field name="subject">larviciding</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20041119.101151</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-Cultural Collaboration Between Parents and Professionals in Special Education: a Sociocultural and Ethnomethological Investigation</field><field name="creator">Choo, Lay Hiok</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the issue of parent participation and cultural diversity in the Australian special education context. Previous research in the U.S. had suggested that the low participation by parents of culturally diverse backgrounds was due to cultural barriers that hindered their partnership with professionals. In reviewing and critiquing this previous research, it became clear that the key concepts of collaboration, disability and culture required reconceptualisation. The theoretical tools deployed in this reconceptualisation are drawn from sociocultural theory and ethnomethodology. Seventeen parents of Chinese and Vietnamese backgrounds and 20 professionals were interviewed regarding the provision of special education for children attending either a special school or special education unit. Follow-up interviews were carried out to probe specific issues related to the salience of culture in parent-professional communication, their understanding of disability, and barriers to parent participation. In addition, the communication books that were passed between parents and professionals on a regular basis were obtained for 7 of the children. These books provide a unique insight into the way parents and professionals accomplished the category of Child-with-a-disability during their entries regarding the mundane practicalities of school and home. In suspending judgment about parent-professional collaboration, this thesis adopts the multiple foci of sociocultural analysis to gain a critical understanding of parent-professional relationships through time and across personal, interpersonal, community and institutional settings. Within this framework, this thesis found that parents and professionals prefer and enact a 'communicating' type of parent participation. Their preferences seemed to depend on a range of circumstances such as their work commitments, financial resources, language resources and changing educational goals for the child. The approach taken in the thesis also affords the specification of diverse models of collaboration (e.g. obliging/directing, influencing/complying, respectful distancing, coordinating, collaborating), each of which may be regarded as worthwhile and acceptable in specific local circumstances. This study found that overall the parent-professional relationship was a trust-given one in which participants unproblematically regarded the professionals as experts. The professionals' reports revealed them to be doing accounting work - creating a moral view of the good parent and good professional. The emphasis on context in both sociocultural and ethnomethodological approaches reframes parental and professional discourse about disability as being context-driven. In employing Membership Categorisation Analysis (MCA) to examine parents' and professionals' descriptions of the child in the communication book and the research interviews, positive as well as negative attributes of the child were obtained. Interpreting the findings in terms of the context of home and school reveals how negative attributes of the child became foregrounded. For example, the orientation to the child as lacking capacity to remember was an outcome of parents and professionals orienting to their (institutional) roles and responsibilities to manage the practicalities of school. The comparison of views reveals strong agreement between the parents and professionals about the child. Interpreting the data based on the task-at-hand of particular data collection settings provides one explanation. For instance, the communication book is a site where parents and professionals align with each other to co-construct a version of the child. Culture is not treated as a static set of traits and behavioural norms that accounts for the communication difficulties between Western-trained professionals and culturally-diverse parents. Rather, culture is theorised in this thesis as an evolving set of semiotic resources and repertoires of practice that participants draw upon and enact in their everyday activities. Using MCA, the ways in which participants deployed cultural categories, the social ends achieved by such deployment, and the attributes they assigned to these cultural categories, are documented. This approach takes cultural difference to be a resource that people use to account for conflicts, rather than as a determining cause of conflict. The documentation of how participants legitimised their explanations to add credibility to their accounts captures their moment-by-moment cultural categorisation work. In comparison to prior research, the significance of this approach is that it looks seriously at the parents' and professionals' mundane and enacted notions of collaboration and participation, the child with a disability, and culture. This thesis has interwoven several data sources and applied complementary analytics in order to reveal and understand some of the everyday complexity of cross-cultural parent professional interaction in the special education context. There is reason to look carefully at the daily achievements of the participants for it is where the intricacies of a phenomenon lie.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Special education</field><field name="subject">cultural diversity</field><field name="subject">Australian background</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese background</field><field name="subject">Chinese background</field><field name="subject">sociocultural investigation</field><field name="subject">ethnomethodological investigation</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural collaboration</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051114.154210</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Trilateral Model for the Management of Corporate Image: an examination of the inter-relationship between an organisation's Self Image, its Projected Image and its Perceived Image</field><field name="creator">Christie, David John</field><field name="description">The Research Topic and the Need for It: This thesis starts with a review of what the literature says about the importance of corporate image and how it needs to be managed as a strategic asset.   However, the problem is there is no model that shows what corporate image comprises and explains how its various components interact with one another so that it can be managed.   The result is a number of confusing and contradictory definitions and unproductive discussions about things like whether corporate reputation and corporate image are different or synonymous.   In response to this need, it is suggested that corporate image comprises three different image perspectives; namely, Self Image, Projected Image and Perceived Image and that it is only when these are defined separately and regarded holistically that corporate image can be properly defined, understood and managed. Objective: The objective of this research was to develop and test this model using triangulated approaches in which data could be acquired and understood from different sources.   To this end questionnaires were developed by document analysis, consultation and discussion. This research was conducted in two very different organisations - a new university campus and a sugar co-operative.   In the interests of confidentiality they have been renamed Barton University's Kingsley Campus and Sunstate Sugar Co-operative Association Limited.   Data was input into both SPSS and HIPSYS computer programs for the Kingsley Campus research and into HIPSYS for the Sunstate Sugar research.   For both research sites the results were discussed with members of all response groups so that accurate interpretations of the data could be made and additional meaningful data acquired. For Kingsley Campus, response groups included all Academic and General Staff of Kingsley Campus for the Self Image and the Projected Image, and for the Perceived Image all Current and Past Students, a representative sample of Grade 12 high school students, advanced diploma students of Kingsley TAFE, and Community Leaders.   In all 3,693 questionnaires were distributed and 934 completed questionnaires were processed. For Sunstate Sugar, response groups included all employees for the Self Image separated by Management, Supervisors and Workforce, all Board members and all Employees who interface with the growers (members of the co-operative) for the Projected Image, and all members of the co-operative for the Perceived Image.   In all 1830 questionnaires were distributed and 916 completed questionnaires were processed. Findings: The results from the Kingsley Campus research showed that the Projected Image needed to be more effectively targeted at the Grade 12 target group.   The results from the Sunstate Sugar research showed that its Perceived Image was affected by its Self Image as well as by its Projected Image and that its Self Image in particular needed to be made more positive.   The results from both organisations suggest that a positive corporate Self Image influences the Projected Image and can have as much impact on the Perceived Image as does the Projected Image. In exploring and discussing the results of this research, each organization derived recommendations which led to their developing action plans for the more effective management of their corporate image. These results indicate that the model created has eliminated a gap in the literature, diffused the confusion regarding what corporate image is, and provided a structure and a methodology by which corporate image can be identified and managed.   It has been shown to have considerable utility.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate image</field><field name="subject">self image</field><field name="subject">projected image</field><field name="subject">perceived image</field><field name="subject">corporate identity</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030102.095828</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In The Eye Of Power: China And Xinjiang From The Qing Conquest To The 'New Great Game' For Central Asia, 1759-2004</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Michael Edmund</field><field name="description">The Qing conquest of 'Xinjiang' ('New Dominion' or 'New Territory') in 1759 proved to be a watershed development in the complex and often ambiguous relation between China and the amorphous Xiyu or 'Western Regions' that had lay 'beyond the pale' of Han Chinese civilisation since the Han (206 BCE-220 CE) and Tang (618-907) dynasties. The Qing destruction of the Mongol Zunghar state in the process of conquering 'Xinjiang' brought to a close the era of the dominance of the steppe nomadic-pastoralist world of Inner Asia over sedentary and agricultural China that had existed since at least 300 BCE with the expansion of the Xiongnu. Immediately following the conquest, as chapter two shall demonstrate, the over-arching goal of Qing rule in the region was to segregate Xinjiang from the Chinese regions of the empire. Yet, at the beginning of the 21st century the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) maintains that the 'Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region' (XUAR) is, and has been throughout recorded history, an 'integral' province of China. This thesis is thus focused on the evolution of the Chinese state's perception of Xinjiang as a dependent appendage in the late 18th century to that of an 'integral' province at the beginning of the 21st century. As such there are two key questions that are the focus of the thesis. First, how - by what processes, means and strategies - did Xinjiang arrive at its contemporary position as a province of the PRC? Second, how has this process impacted on China's 'foreign policy' along its western continental frontiers since the Qing conquest? The thesis is therefore not simply focused upon a discrete period or aspect of the historical development of China's interactions with Xinjiang, but rather an encompassing exploration of the processes that have resulted in China's contemporary dominance in the region. Two encompassing and related themes flow from these questions regarding the Chinese state's response to the dilemmas posed by the rule of Xinjiang. The first stems from the recognition that the present government of China's claims to the 'Chinese-ness' of Xinjiang are more than simply a statement of fact or an attempted legitimisation of current political realities. The statement that Xinjiang is an 'integral' province of the PRC, although indeed a statement of contemporary political reality, is also a profound statement of intent by the Chinese state. It is in fact one manifestation of an over-arching theme of integration and assimilation within the state's perceptions of Xinjiang across the 1759-2004 period. The second theme stems from the question as to how the processes associated with the first theme of integration and assimilation impacted upon the Chinese state's conception of its relation to those regions beyond its orbit. Xinjiang throughout most of Chinese history has been perceived as a 'frontier' region from which non-Chinese influences have entered and at times threatened the North China plain 'heartland' of Han civilisation. This is essentially a theme of confrontation between or opposition of 'external' to Chinese influences. The relationship between these two themes across the 1759-2004 period has been one of 'permanent provocation' whereby their interaction has produced mutual continuity and contestation. The Chinese state's goal of integration, and the concrete strategies and techniques employed in Xinjiang to attain it, have required the continued operation and vitality of opposing tendencies and dynamics. This process has provided (and continues to provide) both impetus and legitimation, in the perception of the state, for the exercise of state power in Xinjiang. Yet, as will become evident in the proceeding chapters, this interaction has not developed along a constant trajectory. Rather, the process has been characterised by fluctuations in the state's commitment to the goal of integration and in its ability to implement appropriate strategies with which to achieve integration. The thesis will thus argue that from the early 19th century onward the goal of integration became embedded in the state's perception of the 'correct' relation between itself and Xinjiang. Moreover, across the 1759-2004 period the notion of integration has evolved to become both the end and means of state action in Xinjiang.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Xinjiang</field><field name="subject">Han civilisation</field><field name="subject">Chinese history 1759-2004</field><field name="subject">Qing conquest</field><field name="subject">Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061121.163131</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life Lines to Life Stories: Some Publications About Women in Nineteenth-Century Australia</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Patricia</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of an introduction and six of my books, published between 1985 and 1999, on aspects of the history of women in nineteenth-century Australia. The books are The Governesses: Letters from the Colonies 1862-1882 (1985); A Colonial Woman: The Life and Times of Mary Braidwood Mowle 1827-1857 (1986); Pen Portraits: Women Writers and Journalists in Nineteenth Century Australia (1988); Pioneer Writer: The Life of Louisa Atkinson, Novelist, Journalist, Naturalist (1990); Tasma: The Life of Jessie Couvreur (1994); and Rosa! Rosa! A Life of Rosa Praed, Novelist and Spiritualist (1999). At the time they were published each of these books either dealt with a new subject or presented a new approach to a subject. Collectively they represent a body of work that has expanded knowledge of women's lives and writing in nineteenth-century Australia. Although not consciously planned as a sequence at the outset, these books developed as a result of the influence on my thinking of the themes that emerged in Australian social and cultural historical writing during this period. The books also represent a development in my own work from the earlier more documentary-based books on letters and diaries to the interpretive challenge of biographical writing and the weaving of private lives with public achievements. These books make up a cohesive, cumulative body of work. Individually and as a whole, they make an original contribution to knowledge of the lives and achievements of women in nineteenth-century Australia. They received critical praise at the time of publication and have led to renewed interest and further research on the subjects they cover. My own knowledge and expertise has developed as a result of researching and writing them.  The Governesses was not only the first full-length study of a particular group of letters but it also documented aspects of the lives of governesses in Australia, a little researched subject to that time. A Colonial Woman, based on a previously unpublished and virtually unknown diary, pointed to the importance of 'ordinary' lives in presenting an enriched view of the past.  Pen Portraits documented the early history of women journalists in Australia, a previously neglected subject. Three of the women I included in Pen Portraits, Louisa Atkinson, Tasma and Rosa Praed, the first two of whom were pioneer women journalists as well as novelists, became the subjects of my full-length biographies.  In my biographies of women writers, Pioneer Writer, Tasma, and Rosa! Rosa!, I recorded and interpreted the lives of these important writers placing them in the context of Australian cultural history as women who negotiated gender barriers and recorded this world in their fiction. My books on Louisa Atkinson and Tasma were the first full-length biographies of these significant but largely forgotten nineteenth-century women writers, while my biography of Rosa Praed was the first for more than fifty years. Each introduced original research that changed perceptions of the women's lives and consequently of attitudes to their creative work. Each provided information essential for further research on their historical significance and literary achievements.  Each involved extensive research that led to informed interpretation allowing insightful surmises essential to quality biography.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="subject">nineteenth century</field><field name="subject">1800s</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">women's studies</field><field name="subject">women writers</field><field name="subject">women authors</field><field name="subject">women journalists</field><field name="subject">female</field><field name="subject">literary</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">biography</field><field name="subject">biographies</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">critical</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">publication</field><field name="subject">publications</field><field name="subject">writing</field><field name="subject">Rosa Praed</field><field name="subject">Louisa Atkinson</field><field name="subject">Tasma</field><field name="subject">Jessie Couvreur</field><field name="subject">Mary Braidwood Mowle</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040719.150756</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental Gift Giving Behaviour at Christmas: An Exploratory Study</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Peter</field><field name="description">Christmas is generally described as cultural, ritual and sociological phenomena of devotion, community and consumption.  The topic of this dissertation concerns a specific stream of research within the general domain of consumer behaviour.  The focal objective of this study is to develop a model and generate theory about parental gift giving behaviour at Christmas.   My study is unique because it attempts to model parental gift giving at Christmas in a consumer behaviour context.  Consumer behaviour theory suggests that parents seek information about possible gifts, set selection criteria for gift purchase, evaluate alternatives and buy the gifts for their children.  Following this broad view of theory, parents respond to children's request behaviour, evaluate the suitability of any requests and purchase the approved or appropriate items as Christmas gifts.  Children are encouraged to request any gifts that they desire, and these gift requests are often for specific brands.   In general Christmas gifts are selected from children's products and brands and there is extensive debate and research relating to television advertising and children's request behaviour at Christmas.  However, parents are not exposed to the same sources of advertising as their children and there is little evidence of research into the very important topics concerning motives, strategies, evaluations and the giving of brands that characterize parents' Christmas gift giving to their children.   The significance of this dissertation resides in the development and presentation of a comprehensive model for the conceptualisation of parental gift giving at Christmas, based on antecedents to parents' social roles of gift giving and direct and indirect behavioural outcomes of those gift giving roles.  Measures for each of these outcomes are developed and gender effects are also explored.   The sample frame was described as a parent with at least one child between the ages of 3-8 years and a survey package was delivered to parents of children from participating schools and kindergartens.  There were 2560 surveys distributed, with 450 individual responses representing a return rate of 17.6%.  The 450 cases available for analysis were factor analysed and formed into composite and latent variables to facilitate statistical analysis via Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, which is an appropriate procedure when the relationships are unknown or theoretical.   The results of the research have two distinct streams.  The first stream relates to the creation and validation of measurement constructs for the concept of Christmas spirit, parental gift giving, request communication, brand benefits and use of information sources, as well as involvement in giving gifts and involvement in giving brands as gifts.  The second stream relates to the relationships between variables; the results support the relationships antecedent to the parents' social roles of gift giving.  There is a significant relationship of Christmas spirit with involvement in giving gifts and with parental gift giving roles.  A significant relationship also exists between involvement in giving gifts and parental gift giving roles.  However, there is limited support for propositions related to outcomes of parental gift giving roles where there are significant relations between these roles and Christmas request communication, brand benefits and information sources. There is also a significant, indirect relationship between brand benefits and involvement in giving brands as gifts.   As part of the second stream, gender differences were examined; the results show that mothers' Christmas spirit has no effect on their gift giving roles and gift giving roles have no significant effect on request communication and information source usage.  On the other hand, the results show that the fathers' gift giving activities reflect the relationships outlined in the parental model.   The study has academic implications for sociology and consumer behaviour disciplines and commercial implications for manufacturers, advertisers, brand owners and retailers.  Further investigations will be necessary to incorporate other elements into the parental gift-giving model and to extend the theory toward a fuller understanding of the parental Christmas gift giving phenomena.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gift</field><field name="subject">gifts</field><field name="subject">giving</field><field name="subject">present</field><field name="subject">presents</field><field name="subject">Christmas</field><field name="subject">shopping</field><field name="subject">purchase</field><field name="subject">purchases</field><field name="subject">purchasing</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">consumer</field><field name="subject">consumers</field><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">parental</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040520.103119</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Science and Colonial Culture: Scientific Interests and Institutions in Brisbane, 1859-1900</field><field name="creator">Clements, Helen Gail</field><field name="description">Historians have investigated for some time the nature and practice of colonial science. Some have seen it in terms of the spread of European influence and knowledge in an age of imperialism, others have studied it in particular local contexts. These studies identi&amp; an emphasis on practical science and natural history, and a degree of dependence on experts resident at the European centre. More recent work thaws attention to the exchange of information that occurred between various sites on the periphery. In this thesis I investigate the nature and practice of science in Brisbane in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Brisbane was a small, isolated town, an administrative centre in a colony dominated by its pastoral industry. The govermnent, partly because of regular budgetary crises and partly because it could not perceive any public benefit, was not interested in funding science. The two scientific institutions - the Philosophical Society, which became the Royal Society in 1883, and the Acclimatisation Society - are studied in order to demonstrate the ways in which men with scientific interests organised themselves and attempted to influence the scientific agenda. I go on to trace the relationships and communication networks of the two men who are arguably the pre-eminent figures in nineteenth-century Queensland science, F. M. Bailey and Joseph Bancroft, in an attempt to determine what effect geographic and intellectual isolation, and lack of funding, had on their activities. Several themes emerge. First, although there was an emphasis as elsewhere on practical science and natural history, for some middle class men science was a social and cultural pursuit. These men, in seeking to re-create the institutions that they had left behind them in Britain, established social and political networks that helped to establish them in a new society. The continual inflow of new immigrants guaranteed an inflow of scientific culture and new technology. Second, acclimatisation and economic botany provided a focus for practical scientific activities. Through the leadership of Lewis Bernays, a public servant with no scientific background or training, acclimatisation became a respectable activity in which people from all over the colony participated. Acclimatisation represented the interface between science, technology and economic progress. Third, other men such as F. M. Bailey, the colonial botanist, and Dr Joseph Bancroft, who had many scientific interests, were intent on both expanding the body of knowledge and making use of what they considered useful knowledge for the benefit of the colony. A simple diffusion model does not explain adequately the complex conditions under which western science was pursued and established in a remote settler society such as Queensland.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colonial science</field><field name="subject">Brisbane (Qld)</field><field name="subject">Queensland science</field><field name="subject">acclimatisation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050914.155807</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sin1 and Sin1 Isoforms: An Investigation into the Biological Significance of a Novel Human Protein Family</field><field name="creator">Cloonan, Nicole</field><field name="description">Stress activated protein kinase (SAPK) interacting protein 1 (Sin1) is a member of a recently characterized gene family, conserved from yeast to humans. The gene copy number is strictly conserved (one Sin1 gene per genome), and the protein may be expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues. The Sin1 family has been implicated in several different signal transduction pathways. Originally identified as a partial cDNA and candidate Ras inhibitor, recent functional studies have revealed interactions with an interferon (IFN) receptor subunit (IFNAR2), and the SAPK JNK. Interactions have also been described between the yeast orthologues and the phosphatidylinositol kinase
TOR2. Collectively, these data suggest that Sin1 has an important cellular role, and this study has investigated possible functions for this protein.  As human Sin1 proteins have no paralogues within the genome, secondary structure homology was used to identify major domains within the protein. Four major domains within human Sin1 were deduced: an N-terminal domain containing a functional nuclear localization signal, a functional nuclear export signal, and a coiledcoil region; the conserved region in the middle that is likely to be a ubiquitin-like &#946;-grasp protein binding domain; a Ras binding domain; and a pleckstrin homology-like domain that targets Sin1 to the plasma membrane and lipid rafts in vivo. Full and partial length EGFP constructs were used to examine the localization of human Sin1, and several isoforms derived from alternative splicing. All isoforms localized to the nucleus and nucleolus. Beyond this, Sin1&#945; and Sin1&#978; had cytoplasmic staining, while Sin1 and Sin1&#946; were also found at the plasma membrane and lipid rafts. Both the N-terminal domain and the conserved region in the middle were found to contribute to nuclear localization.  Comparative genomic analysis between human, mouse, rat, dog, and chicken Sin1 genes revealed a number of conserved intronic regions, and the putative functions of these were predicted. Additionally, a putative promoter module within a CpG island and encompassing the transcription start site was predicted in all species. The human CpG island was found to have promoter activity in HEK293 cells. Using bioinformatics, genes that may be co-regulated with Sin1 were identified. These genes contained the Sin1 promoter module, and were found to co-express in large scale gene expression studies. Most of these genes were directly involved in the cellular response to pathogen infection, suggesting a conserved role for Sin1 in this pathway.  Key biochemical functions of the Sin1 proteins were also identified, including the ability of Sin1 proteins to form dimers, and the ability of over-expressed Sin1 to induce apoptosis (mediated through the conserved region in the middle). Additionally, endogenous Sin1 protein levels were found to change following serum deprivation and hypoosmotic stress. Together, these studies have provided significant insight into the cellular role of Sin1, suggesting a role in inducing apoptosis as part of the IFN response to viral infection. The biological significance of the Sin1 proteins is discussed in the context of their predicted functions and the evolution of the protein family.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sin1</field><field name="subject">Sin1 Isoforms</field><field name="subject">Novel Human Protein Family</field><field name="subject">protein kinase</field><field name="subject">SAPK</field><field name="subject">protein 1</field><field name="subject">mammalian tissues</field><field name="subject">gene family</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071102.150237</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Feminist Understanding of Liturgical Art</field><field name="creator">Close, Jennifer M</field><field name="description">Among church folk in Australia today, there are concerns that soon ? with the surge of secularism in our society ? there will be no Christian tradition left for their children to inherit.  At the same time, there is also a rising desire for spiritual renewal among Australians.  It seems that the church and society are worlds apart.  It is my contention that feminist liturgical artists are in a unique position to bridge the gap between the church and the world, and to promote the spiritual renewal of both. My task in this thesis is to devise a feminist model of liturgical art practice which is both aesthetic and prophetic.  In this model, liturgical art is capable both of inspiring people to contemplate divine meanings and of calling the people to discipleship in the service of God in the world.  It is also able both to encourage hope and challenge injustices.  A balanced approach to the aesthetic and prophetic is suggested in Elisabeth Sch&#252;ssler Fiorenza's (1992) four-step model of feminist research, which shapes my project. The principles which form the framework of my feminist understanding of liturgical art are widely applicable, and do not just apply to women.  Even so, I maintain that women are more gifted than men at understanding the world in terms of relations rather than hierarchies.  In the Catholic church today, we need this sense of relation more than ever.  The church needs to be in creative relation with contemporary culture, or we are going to lose the young people from our ranks, and consequently our future.  Within the church, the hierarchy needs to be in creative relation with the laity, and this requires a more collaborative approach to leadership ? including ministry.  Within the liturgical environment, the church needs images which are able to draw heaven and earth into creative relation.  These inclusive and holistic ideas are basic to a feminist practice of liturgical art as I describe it in this project. To demonstrate what such a practice might look like, I use examples from my own liturgical artwork.  I aim to show how theory/theology and practice are inextricably interrelated in a feminist practice of liturgical art, and that practice precedes theory/theology, and that theory/theology leads to renewed practice.  This has certainly been my experience while writing this thesis. The model of feminist liturgical art practice, which I formulate in this thesis, is postmodern.  The largest theoretical challenge for me in this project was to come to terms with beauty theory, a conceptual framework which underpinned modernist art theory.  By training and by inclination, I am disinclined to favour an art theory in which the highest value is beauty.  Beauty theory was significantly deconstructed in the artworld in the 20th century and the new understandings of beauty arising today show the signs of paradigm shift. In the case of beauty theology, however, nothing comparable has caused theologians to significantly refigure their core value.   Coming to terms with beauty theology was my largest theological challenge.  My solution in both cases was to enlarge the category of beauty by adding ugliness.  I call this category 'beautiful ugliness' (Boyd 1960, 200).  However, 'beautiful ugliness' is not the focus of my aesthetic approach.  I use 'life' as the core value. Into the mix of feminist postmodern art theory/theology, I add some elements of classical American pragmatism.  In a pragmatic frame, ideas need to be tested out in the realities of everyday life.  In line with my chosen core value, I use the terms life-relevant and life-enhancing (Miles 1985, 6) as criteria for testing the value of liturgical art. This project represents my attempt to draw a picture of what a feminist, postmodern, pragmatic, aesthetic/prophetic practice of liturgical art might look like in 21st century Australia.  My hope is that there are other women and men artists, like myself, who work with 'passionate purpose' (Alexander 1933, 53) - driven by their faith in God; by their fidelity to the Christian tradition; by a desire to imaginatively explore, express and stretch the boundaries of that tradition; and by a powerful sense of place-connection and of community-belonging ? who will find this model useful and perhaps inspiring.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church and society</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="subject">spiritual renewal</field><field name="subject">feminist model</field><field name="subject">liturgical art</field><field name="subject">Christian tradition</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060301.141353</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Influencing Ant Assemblages and Ant Community Composition in a Sub-Tropical Suburban Environment</field><field name="creator">Clough, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">The main objective of this study was to examine the abundance and diversity of ants in suburban sites following vegetation removal or modification for development. This research examines the capacity of suburban sites to support ant diversity, which is dependent on the site characteristics and their surrounding environment. The study focused on 29 suburban garden and 3 suburban reserve sites on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. This region, through continuing land development, undergoes ongoing habitat disturbance and modification.  Ground-dwelling ants were collected by pitfall trapping in study sites over three summers between 1997 and 1999. In total, 28,512 ants from 60 species in 31 genera were collected.  Garden sites that maintain vegetation structural diversity were found to be most similar to reserve sites in terms of ant community composition. These sites were highest in ant richness and diversity and contained particularly high proportions of specialized ant species. Sites in close proximity to remnants of native vegetation contained higher species diversity and a greater proportion of specialized ant species.  The introduced tramp ant, Pheidole megacephala was found in 28 of the 32 sites and was found to significantly reduce ant species richness and diversity and displace the dominant ant Iridomyrmex sp. 1 in suburban environments. This ant poses a serious threat to the recovery of a diverse ant fauna to suburban environments. Ant community composition was shown to vary significantly among suburban sites. The ant functional groups commonly found in disturbed sites were abundant in open sites with little canopy cover in this study. Sites that provided vegetation structural diversity and areas of closed canopy supported similar functional groups to natural vegetation remnants. These results indicate that ant communities in suburban environments respond to disturbance in a similar manner to ant communities in tropical forests and rainforests. The dominance by functional groups and presence of specialized species may therefore be used as an indicator of disturbance and the restoration of suitable habitat in suburban sites.  The presence of specialized species of ants in suburban garden sites and their clear preference for particular site characteristics indicate that these species utilize resources available in the suburban matrix. These results indicate that residential suburban sites are of value in the enhancement of ant diversity in fragmented landscapes and that they may provide supportive habitat to, and act as corridors between, vegetation fragments.  In order to preserve biodiversity within suburban environments, landowners should be advised to retain as much existing vegetation within a site as possible. Clearing should be limited to that necessary to allow construction of dwellings and for safety. In addition, landowners should be encouraged to establish or maintain structurally diverse vegetation layers within sites in order to provide diverse microenvironments for fauna habitat.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ant</field><field name="subject">ants</field><field name="subject">assemblage</field><field name="subject">assemblages</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="subject">suburbs</field><field name="subject">suburban</field><field name="subject">suburbia</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">vegetation removal</field><field name="subject">ecological disturbance</field><field name="subject">disturbances</field><field name="subject">Pheidole megacephala</field><field name="subject">Iridomyrmex</field><field name="subject">land clearing</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040719.141317</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linking the Ecological and Economic Values of Wetlands: A Case Study of the Wetlands of Moreton Bay</field><field name="creator">Clouston, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship between the underlying ecological values of wetlands and the economic values they produce.  The importance of the roles that wetlands play is now well recognised yet losses continue at a global level.  It is argued that one cause of wetland loss is a lack of awareness of the values of these systems due to inadequate information of the nexus between ecological functions and economic values.  For example, the off-site, indirect benefits provided by wetlands have largely been ignored.  This has led to an undervaluation of these ecosystems. The integration of ecological and economic values requires incorporating differing types of information and systems of value derived from differing disciplines with differing paradigms.  To understand the differing disciplinary perspectives the thesis explores the ecological functions of wetlands and the economic goods and services that they provide.  The functions and benefits of wetlands are linked at the ecological-economic interface.  A consensus on the definition of ecological value could not be discerned within the discipline of ecology.  Thus, a definition and index of ecological value is developed to demonstrate the attributes of coastal and wetland systems that provide for instrumental human benefits.  These attributes include productivity, the ability to provide habitats for dependent species and the diversity of species and organisation they support.  However, ecological information is not presently available to operationalise the index.  The ability of economic techniques to capture this ecological value is then investigated. Three approaches for assessing non-market values (direct linkage models, revealed preference and stated preference models) are reviewed with respect to their ability to capture ecological value.  An alternative biophysical approach, namely energy analysis, is also considered.  The review suggests that it may be possible to measure ecological value using the contingent valuation method.  The role of information in preference formation and willingness to pay bids is then investigated along with a number of other issues that need to be resolved before using the contingent valuation method. The wetlands of the case study area, Moreton Bay, Australia exhibit both ecological and economic values.  The wetlands contribute approximately one-third of primary productivity in the Bay, provide habitat for a wide range of dependent species (including internationally recognised migratory wader birds) and have a diverse fauna with a relatively large number of endemic species.  Economic values of the wetlands include both direct and indirect use values (for example, fishing, recreation, water quality improvements and storm buffering) and non-use values.  Non-use values include the value in preserving the environment for future generations (bequest value) and the existence of vulnerable animals such as turtles and dugongs, which one may never expect to see.  If consumers are willing to pay to preserve these animals, this is also a valid economic value.  The economic technique of contingent valuation is tested to determine if it is possible to capture ecological value by providing respondents, selected by random sample, to a survey with the relevant information.  A case study is undertaken in Moreton Bay to determine respondents' willingness to pay to improve water quality and hence protect the wetlands.  To test the effects of differing types information, four different versions of the survey were sent to four groups of 500 respondents.  Case A provided no extra information so it could be used as a control.  Case B included information about the ecological values of the wetlands of Moreton Bay.  Case C provided information about the economic use values of the wetlands in the Bay including direct and indirect use.  Case D provided information about the non-use values of endangered species resident in the Bay that are dependent on the wetlands.  The results indicate that the provision of different types of information influences willingness to pay.  However, willingness to pay when provided with ecological information is not significantly different from willingness to pay when provided with other information. As it was not possible from the research undertaken to state that the contingent valuation method can capture ecological value, an alternative approach is proposed to link ecological and economic values.  It is argued that ecologists and economists need to develop common aims and scales of assessment.  Further, communication between the two disciplines can be enhanced through the use of agreed indicator terms.  Through an iterative approach it should then be possible to understand the linkages between changes in indicators of ecosystem values and indicators of economic value.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wetlands</field><field name="subject">wetland conservation</field><field name="subject">wetland protection</field><field name="subject">environmental economics</field><field name="subject">ecological economics</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030828.140330</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Interaction of Industrial Tribunals and Workplace Industrial Relations in Australia: the Metal trades, 1900 to 1929</field><field name="creator">Cockfield, Sandra A</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the influence of compulsory state arbitration and wages board systems on workplace industrial relations. Using an historical and comparative case study approach, the thesis researches workplace industrial relations at three firms operating in the metal industry between 1900 and 1929. A political economy perspective is employed to examine the interaction of institutional stnictures and economic and political processes in the regulation of the wage-effort bargain at the workplace. Key concepts are drawn from both mainstream industrial relations theory, in particular the Oxford School approach, and labour process theory. Drawing on the work of flanders, a distinction is made between the economic and political aspects of the wage-effort bargain through the differentiation of market relations and managerial relations. This thesis argues that arbitral and wages board systems interacted with a range of factors to shape and influence workplace industrial relations. In keeping with the political economy perspective, the thesis examines the economic, industry, technological, political, and institutional environment within which the three cases operated, identifying changes and trends in these factors during the period under review and their implications for workplace industrial relations. The three cases allowed a closer examination of the influence of these general trends on the development of workplace industrial relations. The cases demonstrate the diversity of the metals sector, each representing a different industry in that sector. Further, the cases differed in their geographic and jurisdictional location, allowing comparisons between Victoria and New South Wales to be made. An examination of the role of arbitral tribunals and wages boards argues that the tribunals used their ability to regulate and stabilise market relations to offset their intervention in managerial relations. In this respect the tribunals sought to engineer changes in managerial relations favourable to industry development and yet simultaneously obtain support from the unions through improvements in market relations. As a consequence of these conflicting objectives the tribunals often behaved in a contradictory manner. In addition, unintended consequences often flowed from tribunal regulation and were important in shaping events at the workplace. Thus while industrial tribunals sought to improve market relations, they inadvertently assisted workers to gain more influence over managerial relations. In each case the workplace was the site of much regulatory activity, whether initiated by management, unions or workers. However, the three cases each present a different pattern of workplace industrial relations in terms: of scope of regulation at the workplace; the role of unions; the nature of managerial strategy; the role of unions; and the implementation and enforcement of tribunals decisions. Moreover, the effect of arbitration and wages board systems at each workplace varied, with the influence of a particular matrix of industry, economic, technological and institutional conditions shaped at the workplace.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Compulsory State arbitration</field><field name="subject">arbitral tribunals</field><field name="subject">wage boards</field><field name="subject">worplace industrial relations</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050914.170636</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Application of in situ Digital Networks to News Reporting and Delivery</field><field name="creator">Cokley, John D</field><field name="description">The development of digital networks has allowed the largest news media organisations to consolidate and centralise their publishing businesses in flourishing capital-city markets. This has resulted in a withdrawal from other less-viable markets, especially those which are geographically remote, and the subsequent emergence of the 'digital divide' with its attendant negative effects. This thesis proposes that the combination of technologies, theories and processes which has brought about the 'digital divide' can now be realigned to reverse those negative effects, and to enhance the possibility of focussed participatory communication taking place within and between those previously less-viable markets. This enhanced participatory communication - which I have named 'integrated journalism' - brings with it measurable and positive effects, generally known as community capacity building effects, which lead to better outcomes for the members of enhanced communities, a more innovative and flourishing approach to life and business, and a more innovative and forward-looking atmosphere within enhanced communities. Two new models are devised and presented: the first allows members of audience communities to learn and implement the process of publishing a community newspaper under the tuition of an experienced journalist; the second enables both journalists and audience members to measure and direct the effects of news publication within communities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">News media</field><field name="subject">digital networks</field><field name="subject">digital divide</field><field name="subject">integrated journalism</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060731.174040</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myth, Monolith or Normative Model? Evolution of the Career Service Model of Employment in the Queensland Public Service 1859-2000</field><field name="creator">Colley, Linda Katurah</field><field name="description">Public services play an essential role in society, and every citizen uses them.  They have traditionally been the principal means of implementing the political will, through policy development and implementation.  Yet it is almost a national sport to criticise public servants.  Their image is often poor, fed by television programmes such as Yes Minister.  Common perceptions include that they have little real merit, do not work hard, are under little pressure to perform, are too powerful, are almost impossible to dismiss, and could benefit from some private sector experience.  Such are the consequences of the career service model of employment that public servants enjoy. This thesis considers the much-maligned career service model of public sector employment relations, and asks how important it was, how it evolved, and why.  First, it outlines the traditional understanding of public service employment, with its central tenets of merit, tenure, standardised conditions and political neutrality, all administered by an independent central personnel agency, and then explores the adoption, adaptation and reform of that model in three major western democracies - Britain, the United States and Australia.  Then, it considers the implementation and evolution of that model in the Queensland public service from 1859 to 2000. The thesis argues that the traditional career service model was necessary to overcome problems of politicisation, corruption, insecurity and inefficiency that arose from the previous patronage model in the early 1800s.  The model contained sound principles that were largely consistent with Westminster conventions, and were considered necessary for effective service in a political environment.  Poor implementation of the model led to growing dissatisfaction by the late 20th century.  However, rather than diagnose the problem as poor implementation and perhaps inadequate political leadership of the service, the career service model itself was found deficient, and was subjected to extensive reform through the weakening of its central tenets.  The evolution of the career service demonstrates some circularity, as the problems of politicisation and insecurity that existed prior to the career service model begin to re-emerge.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">civil service</field><field name="subject">public service</field><field name="subject">civil servants</field><field name="subject">public servants</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">image</field><field name="subject">public opinion</field><field name="subject">politicisation</field><field name="subject">politicization</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050602.120554</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music as Evocative Power: The Intersection of Music with Images of the Divine in the Songs of Hildegard of Bingen</field><field name="creator">Collingridge, Lorna Marie</field><field name="description">Hildegard's songs evoke an erotic and embodied devotion to a Divinity imagined as sensuous, relational, immanent and often female.  These songs, written for use in her predominantly female community, are part of Hildegard's educational program to guide the spiritual development of the women in her Benedictine monastery.  Hildegard's theology of music proposes that the physical act of singing enables humans to experience connection to the Living Light (Hildegard's most common address for the voice of the Holy Presence in her visions, lux vivens), and to embody this Divinity in their midst.  Her songs express, in dense poetic texts set to widely-ranging chant-like melodies, her rich imaging of the fecund presence of the Divine.  The singers are thus encouraged to imagine themselves in relationship with the Holy One, the Living Light, through the physical act of singing these evocative songs. This dissertation analyses four of Hildegard's songs, representing a small cross section of her musical oeuvre.  The analysis elucidates the way in which the music affectively conveys the meaning and significance of the texts.  Carefully incising the "flesh" from the structural "bones" of the melodies reveals underlying organising configurations which pervade the songs and deliver the texts in a distinctive manner.  Hildegard professed herself to be musically uneducated because she lacked a knowledge of music notation, although she admitted to extensive experience in singing Divine Office.  However, she clearly claims to be the oral composer of her songs, arranging late in her life for music scribes to notate her melodies.  My analysis unravels the influence of the oral composer as it intersects with the influence of the musically trained scribes who neumed her texts. Hildegard wrote that the "words symbolize the body, and the jubilant music indicates the spirit" (Scivias 3:12:13).  She claims that the music conveys the meaning of the texts with affective power, and my analysis shows ways in which the oral composer endeavors to achieve this goal.  Her texts, conveyed by her melodies and thus intimately entwined with the words they deliver, are powerfully persuasive forces in the spiritual education of the women in her monastery.  This dissertation uncovers significant insights which can inform the communal practice of worship of the Divine, especially where song forms part of that worship, and particularly in regard to the imagining of Divinity in ways which can nourish the diversity of all humans, all creatures, and all creation.  The work of feminist theologians is brought into dialogue with Hildegard's imagery and educational purpose, thus making available ways of imagining the Divine which are especially important for contemporary women, who have suffered from being excluded from the imago Dei.  Thus the dissertation unearths a rich lode of female, and creatural embodied images, which threads its way though the millennia, but now needs to be mined to uncover images that might work for contemporary Christians seeking multiple imaging of the Divine to touch the deep feminist, ecological and liberative yearnings of many hearts and spirits.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hildegard of Bingen</field><field name="subject">Saint Hildegard von Bingen</field><field name="subject">Hildegardis</field><field name="subject">religious songs</field><field name="subject">song</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">musical</field><field name="subject">spiritual</field><field name="subject">the Divine</field><field name="subject">Divinity</field><field name="subject">female</field><field name="subject">feminist</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">woman</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">Christian</field><field name="subject">Christians</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">worship</field><field name="subject">sacred vocal music</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040624.110229</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Hormonal and Vascular Genes in Migraine</field><field name="creator">Colson, Natalie</field><field name="description">Migraine is a frequent debilitating neurological disorder that is considered to be genetically complex with a multifactorial mode of inheritance. It has a high prevalence with approximately 18% of women and 6% of men suffering from the disorder. Migraine is characterized by severe head pain with associated nausea, emesis, photophobia, phonophobia, and neurological disturbances. The International Headache Society (IHS) has classified various types of migraine according to their clinical features. The two main subtypes of migraine are migraine without aura (MO), occurring in ~70-75% of migraineurs, and migraine with aura (MA) which occurs in ~25% of migraineurs. Some people experience both types of attack in their lives. While the precise pathogenesis of migraine is unknown, it is widely accepted that short-term alterations in neuronal activity occur in relation to the attack, along with temporary changes in the cerebral vasculature. Trigeminal nerve activation is also considered pivotal to progression of a migraine attack. Neurotransmitters, especially serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), platelet activation and sympathetic hyperactivity all appear to play a part, whether as part of the primary triggering event, or as a response mechanism. Migraine imparts a significant burden on society, both socially and financially. The World Health Organization has identified migraine among the world's top 20 leading causes of disability, with an impact that extends far beyond individual suffering. There is significant evidence from family and twin studies to indicate a strong genetic component to migraine. The current understanding of migraine is that it is a polygenic multifactorial disorder. It has been postulated that genetic factors set the individual migraine threshold, with environmental influences playing a modulating role. It is likely that many genes may provide an important although moderate contribution to an individual&#146;s migraine susceptibility. The identification of migraine susceptibility genes has been the focus of substantial research to date and could eventually lead to improved treatments and greater understanding of the disorder. Several loci have shown promise, although these need to be followed up by both replication and functional studies to determine a definitive causative role. This research investigated the role of both hormonal and vascular related genes as candidate genes that may play a role in migraine susceptibility due to the well-known role of hormones and vascular changes in some migraineurs. The estrogen receptor (ESR) and progesterone receptor (PGR) genes are potential migraine candidates due to the recognized hormonal influence on migraine susceptibility. Migraines in women frequently occur during the childbearing years and are often influenced by significant hormonal milestones. The fluctuating hormone levels of the menstrual cycle have been implicated in migraine but a definitive role is yet to be established. It has been suggested that factors additional to circulating hormone levels may be at play. This research considered that variation in the ESR 1 and PGR genes may confer an increased migraine risk. To investigate the potential role of these genes in migraine, association studies investigating variants in ESR 1 and PGR were undertaken in two independent casecontrol cohorts. This was followed up by mutation screening and gene expression analysis in an effort to elucidate a functional role for these genes in the pathogenesis of migraine. Vascular genes also represent likely migraine candidates as alterations in both vascular function and cerebral blood flow are well known in migraine. Furthermore, cortical spreading depression (CSD), a depolarization wave that propagates across the brain cortex and has been speculated to cause the neurological symptoms that present in MA, has also been linked to vascular dysfunction. The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase (MTRR) genes both play a role in vascular functioning and were thus considered potential migraine candidates for this study. Both are involved in the pathway of homocysteine metabolism. Impaired activity of these enzymes can lead to mild hyperhomocysteinemia which is believed to lead to oxidative arterial damage. This may in turn impact on migraine susceptibility, possibly through the activation of trigeminal fibres. The MTHFR 677T allele results in an amino acid change in the catalytic domain of the enzyme leading to mild hyperhomocysteinemia. This particular variant has been implicated in migraine in four separate studies. One of these studies also suggested a role for the MTHFR 1298C allele in migraine. This allele also results in an amino acid change and reduced enzyme activity. Similarly, the MTRR 66G allele results in an amino acid change and has been associated with reduced activity of MTRR and increased plasma homocysteine concentration. To investigate the role of the ESR 1, PGR, MTHFR and MTRR genes in migraine, samples from two large independent case control cohorts were investigated. Cohort 1 was comprised of 275 migraineur samples and 275 age, sex and ethnicity matched controls while cohort 2 comprised 300 cases and 300 matched controls. All individuals were collected at the Genomics Research Centre with migraine diagnosis undertaken by HIS criteria and migraine affected individuals designated as MO or MA. Results of analysis of ESR 1 indicated a positive association with migraine in the two large independent cohorts for the exon 8 G594A polymorphism (P = 0.003; P = 8x10-6). Similarly, the PGR analysis showed a positive association with migraine for the PROGINS allele (P = 0.02; P = 0.003). Results also showed that individuals with both ESR 1 and PGR susceptibility alleles were 3.2 times more likely to suffer migraine those those with no susceptibility alleles. As the ESR 1 variant is synonymous, a mutation analysis was undertaken in a small sub-sample of individuals carrying the susceptibility allele, but no mutations were detected in these particular samples. Detailed mutation analysis of ESR 1 in a larger study group may be warranted. An ESR 1 and PGR expression analysis by RT-PCR was undertaken to examine if there were any notable expression level changes in migraineurs versus controls and additionally whether the susceptibility genotypes influenced gene expression. Altered expression levels may point to a functional change in the gene. Although results did not show any significant difference in expression levels in the case/control group, nor any influence in gene expression conferred by the specific susceptibility genotypes, ESR 1 expression did appear to be down-regulated in the migraine group and more specifically in the migraine susceptibility genotype subgroup. A larger study group may therefore be warranted to detect any potential genuine changes in gene expression. Overall, these results suggested that these hormonal genes appear to play a role in migraine susceptibility, although further studies are needed to define this. Results of the MTHFR 677 analysis showed that the TT genotype was significantly associated with the MA subgroup in a joint analysis of the two independent cohorts (P = 0.004). Results of analysis of MTHFR 1298, which is tightly linked to the 677 locus, showed a significant association in female migraineurs (P = 0.009). Similarly, results of the MTRR analysis also showed a significant difference between the female case and control groups with the G allele over-represented in female migraineurs (P = 0.022) These results may indicate that a significant gender effect appears in this locus as well as the MTHFR 1298 locus although results may also be due to a larger number of female migraineurs conferring increased statistical power to the gender subgroup. Interaction analysis of the MTHFR 1298 locus and the MTRR locus showed that females who carried both variants under a recessive model were 5 times more likely to suffer migraine those those with no susceptibility genotypes. Overall these results indicated that these vascular genes appear to play a role in migraine susceptibility. The final study focused on 6 genetic variants that had shown a positive association with migraine and/or MA in the same large association population analysed in this research. The aim of this study was to provide preliminary data on the potential role of genetic profiling in migraine. Using the genotypic data to create vascular and hormonal risk profiles based on positive association and interaction of MTHFR 677 T and ACE D alleles, and MTHFR 1298 AA and MTRR GG genotypes as vascular variants; and positive association and interaction of ESR 1 594 A and PGR PROGINS as hormonal variants, this study was able to demonstrate the relevance of genetic risk profiling to migraine. Results showed a significantly higher proportion of individuals with at least one genetic risk profile in the migraine group compared to those in the control group (P = 6 x 10-6). Individuals who possessed either the vascular and/or hormonal genetic risk profile were 8.6 times more likely to suffer from migraine than those who possessed a &#145;no risk&#146; profile. This indicated a greater effect than the individual effect of each of these variants. Furthermore individuals who possessed a vascular or both risk profiles were more likely to suffer nausea, emesis, phonophobia and photophobia, and have a mother who also suffered migraine. Overall, the genetic profiling approach provided interesting preliminary data on migraine susceptibility and indicated that such an approach may prove very useful for migraine diagnosis, particularly when all migraine genes have been identified. In conclusion this study provided the first indication that hormone receptor genes play a role in migraine susceptibility. Hormones have long been considered to play a role in the disorder but this study has provided the first molecular evidence to support this premise. In addition, this study showed that vascular related genes also play a role in migraine susceptibility. Finally, this study has clearly shown that migraine is a complex disorder involving multiple genes. Although a number of studies have implicated neurotransmitter related genes in the disorder, the present study is the first to show that both vascular and hormonal genes also play a role in migraine susceptibility. Thus there now appear to be three classes of genes that affect migraine susceptibility and although this study has implicated new variants, the preliminary genetic profiling study has shown that not all predisposing variants involved in the disorder have been defined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hormonal</field><field name="subject">Vascular</field><field name="subject">Genes</field><field name="subject">Migraine</field><field name="subject">Neurological Disorder</field><field name="subject">Headache</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071121.104112</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Epibenthic and Planktonic Fauna in Subtropical Prawn Grow Out Ponds</field><field name="creator">Coman, Francis Edmund</field><field name="description">The assemblage composition, biomass and dynamics of zooplankton and epibenthos were examined in a commercial prawn pond in southeast Queensland over two seasons.  Physico-chemical characteristics of the pond water were measured concurrently. Numbers and biomass of zooplankton in the surface tows (140 micrometre mesh) varied from 8 ind. L-1 (44 micrograms L-1) to 112 ind. L-1 (324 micrograms L-1) in the first season, with peaks in biomass corresponding to peaks in numbers.  In the second season the zooplankton numbers varied from 12 to 590  ind. L-1, but peaks in numbers did not correspond with peaks in biomass, which varied from 28 to 465 micrograms L-1. This was due to differences in the size of the dominant taxa across the season.  Although this occurred in both seasons, the effect on biomass was more pronounced in the second season.  In both seasons, immediately after the ponds were stocked with prawn postlarvae there was a rapid decline in zooplankton numbers, particularly of the dominant larger copepods.  This was probably due to predation by the postlarvae.  Subsequent peaks in zooplankton numbers were principally due to barnacle nauplii. The largest peaks in zooplankton numbers occurred before stocking in the first season, but the largest peaks were in the middle of the second season.  While changes in abundance and biomass of the zooplankton assemblage were not correlated with physico-chemical characteristics in the first season, there were correlations between zooplankton numbers and temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and secchi disk readings in the second season.  No correlations were found with zooplankton biomass and physico-chemical characteristics in the second season.  The correlations in the second season were mainly due to the high prevalence of barnacle nauplii through the middle part of the season, and may reflect suitable conditions for barnacle reproduction. Epibenthic faunal abundance in the beam trawls (1 mm mesh) peaked at 14 ind. m-2 and 7 ind. m-2 in the first and second seasons respectively and the biomasses at 0.8 g m-2 and 0.7 g m-2.  Peaks in abundance of epibenthos did not correspond to peaks in biomass. This was due to large differences in the size of the taxa across the seasons.  Sergestids (Acetes sibogae) and amphipods were the most abundant taxa in beam trawl samples. Amphipods were only abundant in the first season, with their numbers increasing towards the end of the grow out period.  Acetes were abundant in both seasons, but were dominant in the second season.  Correlations between physico-chemical parameters and epibenthos numbers were found to be strongly influenced by the dominant taxa in each season.  In the first season, negative correlations were found between epibenthos abundance and pH and temperature.  These relationships may reflect an effect on the growth of macroalgae in the pond, with which the amphipods were strongly associated, rather than a direct effect on the epibenthos.  In the second season, a positive correlation existed between temperature and epibenthos abundance, however this was strongly influenced by the very high abundance of Acetes in the last sampling period.  No correlations were found between epibenthic fauna biomass and physico-chemical parameters.  Abundances of epibenthic fauna were not related to zooplankton densities indicating this source of food was not likely to be a limiting factor.    Neither the pond water exchange regime nor moon phase could explain changes observed in abundances of zooplankton or epibenthos assemblages in the first season, however the sampling regime was not designed to specifically investigate these effects.  In the second season water exchanges were sampled more rigorously.  The density of zooplankton in the outlet water was from 2 to 59% of the density of zooplankton in the pond, and the zooplankton density of the inlet water was from 9 to 50% of the outlet water.  The number of zooplankton recruited into the pond from the inlet water, after the prawns were stocked, was negligible and contributed little to changes observed in zooplankton assemblages. Reproduction of barnacles within the pond appeared to play the most important role in changes in the assemblage.  Water exchange did, however, appear to play a greater role in the changes observed in epibenthic fauna assemblages.  In the last season of sampling the feeding of the dominant epibenthic species, Acetes sibogae, was examined using a combination of gut content and stable isotope analysis.  Acetes gained little nutrition directly from the pelleted feed, probably relying primarily on zooplankton as their direct food source.  Other dietary items such as macroalgae also played a role in the nutrition of the Acetes.  If Acetes numbers were high at the beginning of a season they may compete with the newly stocked prawns for the zooplankton resource.  However, they will not compete with the prawns later in the season when the prawns are gaining most of their nutrition from the pelleted feed. Overall it appears that zooplankton are important to the nutrition of the prawns at the beginning of the season when the assemblage is usually dominated by copepods. Later in the season the assemblage is dominated by barnacle nauplii which are recruited from within the pond. The establishment of an abundant assemblage of suitable zooplankton species before stocking prawn postlarvae would appear to be beneficial, if not essential.  The assemblage of epibenthic fauna changes throughout the season as new recruits are brought in from outside the pond.  Epibenthic faunal assemblages in ponds from southeast Queensland are dominated by Acetes which are not likely to adversely affect the production of prawns unless they are particularly abundant early in the grow out season when the prawns would be utilising the same food resources as Acetes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plankton</field><field name="subject">zooplankton</field><field name="subject">epibenthos</field><field name="subject">epibenthic fauna</field><field name="subject">aquaculture</field><field name="subject">prawn farming</field><field name="subject">prawn farms</field><field name="subject">Acetes sibogae</field><field name="subject">segestids</field><field name="subject">amphipods</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030926.091736</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Population Connectivity in Lotic Fauna: Constraints of Subdivision for Biotic Responses to Stream Habitat Restoration</field><field name="creator">Cook, Benjamin Douglas</field><field name="description">Connectivity in ecological systems is a broad concept that embodies the transmission of ecosystem components throughout landscapes at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Of relevance to the present study are the connections (or lack thereof) among local populations of stream fauna - population connectivity in lotic systems. Dispersal, recolonisation and migration are the demographic forms of population connectivity, and gene flow is the genetic aspect of population connectivity. Both forms of population connectivity have underpinned some of the classic theories and hypotheses in stream ecology, and have implications for pure and applied stream ecology, including ecosystem restoration. Conceptual models in ecology can facilitate understanding and predictability of the ecosystem processes they represent, and have potential applicability as management tools or 'rules of thumb' in conservation and restoration programs. Various theoretical models describe potential patterns of connectivity among local populations and in this thesis these models were used to evaluate population connectivity in a freshwater fish (southern pygmy perch, Nannoperca australis) and two reproductively isolated genetic lineages of freshwater shrimp (Paratya spp.) in small, geomorphically degraded streams in south eastern Australia. These streams (the Granite Creeks) have been the focus of a recent habitat restoration trial and several studies have examined fish and macroinvertebrate community responses to the experiment. It was the purpose of this study to contribute information about population connectivity in the selected species to complement these community ecology studies. Population connectivity was examined in these species using molecular data (mitochondrial and nuclear genetic data) and natural abundance isotopic signatures of nitrogen and carbon. At the landscape scale, results showed that populations of N. australis and the P. australiensis lineages were isolated among the streams and among sites within streams, and that there was no consistent pattern of isolation-by-distance in genetic data for any species. Thus, classic models of population connectivity, such as the Island Model and Stepping-Stone Model, were not supported by this study. Results indicated that population models that incorporated more complex aspects of stream structure may be more appropriate than these classic models for approximating observed patterns of population connectivity in lotic systems. The Stream Hierarchy Model (SHM) predicts that the hierarchical aspect of stream structure (i.e. stream confluences) have a dominant role in shaping patterns of population connectivity in lotic fauna, whereby populations among streams are more isolated than those within them. Although stream confluences were found to have an important role in population subdivision for the species examined in this study, the expectations of the SHM were met for only N. australis. For the P. australiensis lineages, the influence of topography (i.e. the longitudinal aspect of stream structure) was just as important as stream confluences in isolating local populations. Large-scale determinants of population isolation were thus found to be associated with both the hierarchical and longitudinal aspects of stream structure, and were not well represented by any single theoretical model of population connectivity. At within-stream scales, upland populations tended to be extremely isolated from other populations and had temporally stable genetic signatures. In contrast, lowland populations were connected to other lowland populations within the same stream to a greater degree, although the connections were patchy and a slight signature of temporal instability in the genetic data was evident for one of the P. australiensis lineages. Thus, metapopulation or patchy population models were found to represent connections among lowland populations within the same stream, although they were not appropriate for describing connectivity among upland populations. This finding highlights the importance of the longitudinal aspect of stream structure in shaping ecological patterns in lotic systems, and demonstrates that local patterns of population connectivity can vary over relatively small spatial scales. Overall, the results illustrate that both hierarchical and longitudinal aspects of stream structure can have important roles in isolating populations of stream fauna. They therefore also represent constraints for the ability of aquatic fauna to colonise restored habitat in streams. The corollary of this, however, is that such isolated populations of stream fauna represent appropriate population units at which to target habitat restoration. The hierarchical and longitudinal aspects of stream structure may thus represent 'rules of thumb' or 'landscape filters' that stream restoration ecologists could use to predict likely isolated populations of lotic fauna across the landscape. Such a 'rule of thumb' might be the inclusion of multiple isolated population units in restoration programs, as this strategy is likely to generate the greatest biological response to the restoration at the landscape scale, particularly with respect to intra-specific genetic diversity captured by restoration. At small spatial scales, such as for a single stream or tributary, the longitudinal aspect of stream structure can be an important factor to consider when designing stream habitat restoration programs. In this study, lowland sites were unstable and there were patchy connections among local lowland populations within the same stream, whereas upland populations were isolated at this scale. In contrast, other studies have found that upstream populations of some species can be connected in a patchy fashion in other systems. For such unstable sections of stream, where there are patchy patterns of local population connectivity, the inclusion of multiple restored patches, especially refugial habitat, is likely to produce the greatest biotic response at the patch scale, particularly with respect to demographic responses (such as local colonisation). Multiple restored refugial patches will enable species to persist throughout the stream section during adverse environmental conditions, will allow for variation in local movement patterns and distances between species and between years with contrasting environment conditions (e.g. stream flow), and may harbour different species assemblages and intraspecific genotypes due to stochastic processes (i.e. have functional heterogeneity). The hierarchical and longitudinal aspects of stream structure are thus important determinants of population connectivity at both large and small spatial scales, and have implications for how stream biota will respond to restoration at patch and landscape scales.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecological systems</field><field name="subject">stream fauna</field><field name="subject">lotic fauna</field><field name="subject">stream habitat restoration</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070718.115649</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Management of Financial Resources: Post-Merger Structural Choice in a Blue Collar Union</field><field name="creator">Corrie, Joan</field><field name="description">Union mergers have occurred since unions were first established. Research on this particular aspect of the union movement is well established in the UK and the US. However, there are few studies of Australian union mergers, despite the fact that many Australian unions took part in a 'merger boom' in the 1980s and 1990s. Two of the few Australian studies, Hocking (1996) and Campling and Michelson (1998), utilised resource dependency and strategic choice theories to ascertain the why and how of union mergers. However, these Australian studies, like their UK and US counterparts, cease with the completion of the merger and, consequently, there is little known of the post-merger operation of unions. How does the integration of the merger partners - with their traditions, structures and financial arrangements - occur? This thesis rectifies the gap in the literature by means of a qualitative, longitudinal study of the merger and post-merger activities of one of the largest and most prominent unions in Australia, the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union (AMWU), as it moved towards complete amalgamation. The thesis examines the period 1995-2003. Four of the five pre-merger unions faced a serious and continued decline in membership and all faced mounting financial deficits. From 1995, the year the various mergers were completed, membership decline continued and financial resources dwindled further, providing the impetus for further and significant post-merger changes. The analysis demonstrates that, due to a continuing lack of financial resources, the AMWU leadership initiated a budgeting strategy which influenced the actions and changed the opinions of many of the Union's officials, guiding them towards accepting integration of the constituent divisions and near complete amalgamation. The thesis answers the questions of why and how a union moves from a negotiated federated structure towards amalgamation, post merger, with a particular focus on financial decision-making processes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blue collar unions</field><field name="subject">union mergers and amalgamations</field><field name="subject">Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union</field><field name="subject">workers' union structure</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070724.091823</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Australian Man in Search of an Embodied Spirituality</field><field name="creator">Costigan, Philip John</field><field name="description">This thesis attempts to answer the question of how a framework for a contemporary Australian male spirituality might be formulated. It provides a theoretical base for constructing a spirituality for Australian men that would prove more relevant than the religious patriarchal framework that many men have traditionally experienced. The study makes use of the potentially positive impact on men's spirituality, and that of Australian men in particular, of three of the most significant revolutions affecting contemporary society - the feminist, environmental and embodiment movements. A critical examination is first made of the many strands of the contemporary Men's Movement and the spiritualities associated with them to gain an overall view of the state of men's spirituality today. From this overview, a new philosophical and religious stance is developed, spiritual virism. This may be defined as a sacred worldview by and for men, which, informed by feminist spiritual principles and perspectives, results in a range of redefined personal and collective spiritualities for men in relation to the Sacred. As a result, men are challenged to work actively for the deconstruction of religious patriarchy with a view to the liberation of both men and women. Spiritual virism, in turn, defines the methodology employed throughout the thesis. It is a critical analytical methodology drawn from the disciplines of academic spirituality and feminist theory. It entails the deconstruction of life-denying forms of patriarchal religious attitudes and the construction of more life-giving forms of spirituality. As experience is central in both spiritual and feminist research, personal texts, involving my own spiritual experience expressed in my paintings and in autobiographical commentaries on them, are the prime starting points in this analysis. Discursive discourse, involving more abstract methodology, follows. The deconstruction of the traditional patriarchal understanding of the Sacred in Western Christianity is undertaken first. The construction of more life-giving images of the Sacred, drawn from parallel paradigms in feminist thealogy and earth-based religion, follows. The results are that men may find a positive re-imaging of the Sacred in non-gendered forms such as the Source or the Great Cycle of Life, or in gendered forms such as the god, radically reinterpreted, and especially in the feminine Sacred, the Goddess. Evolving contemporary perceptions of the place of the environment in spirituality, such as ecofeminism, deep ecology, the new science and ecotheology, are employed to help construct more positive spiritual practices for men with respect to nature, the earth and the cosmos. This follows a deconstruction of traditional patriarchal understandings of them within society and Western Christianity. Insights such as the Sacred embodied in the unfolding cosmos, in the living earth and in the web of all life, lead men to a more contemplative, less exploitative attitude to the world around them. Thirdly, having deconstructed the traditional patriarchal attitude of Western Christianity to the male body, the positive impact of contemporary embodiment theory and practice on a spirituality for men is sought. Implications are drawn from feminist understandings of the sacrality of the female body, from Christian embodiment theology and from the practices of body-honouring religions. A more body/earth-centred spirituality, which is non-dualistic and respects the sacredness of the body and sexuality, emerges. A unified spiritual framework draws together and integrates the positive insights of each of these studies. In seeking the application of this generic male spirituality to the Australian context, this framework is brought into dialogue with contemporary approaches to Australian spirituality. The result is a way of formulating an Australian men's spirituality from the perspective of An Australian Man in Search of an Embodied Spirituality, the title of my thesis. This spirituality is rooted in the land of Australia, where the body of the Australian man is seen as sacred and embodied within the sacred body of the Australian land. A sacred Australian mythos is explored to personalise this embodiment. This images the masculine Sacred, the god, as embodied within the man, who both move within the all-encompassing female Sacred, the Goddess, embodied within the land of Australia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">embodied spirituality</field><field name="subject">Western Christianity</field><field name="subject">celibacy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070201.115833</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calibration of Two Dimensional Saccadic Electro-Oculograms Using Artificial Neural Networks</field><field name="creator">Coughlin, Michael J.</field><field name="description">The electro-oculogram (EOG) is the most widely used technique for recording eye movements in clinical settings. It is inexpensive, practical, and non-invasive. Use of EOG is usually restricted to horizontal recordings as vertical EOG contains eyelid artefact (Oster &amp; Stern, 1980) and blinks. The ability to analyse two dimensional (2D) eye movements may provide additional diagnostic information on pathologies, and further insights into the nature of brain functioning. Simultaneous recording of both horizontal and vertical EOG also introduces other difficulties into calibration of the eye movements, such as different gains in the two signals, and misalignment of electrodes producing crosstalk. These transformations of the signals create problems in relating the two dimensional EOG to actual rotations of the eyes. The application of an artificial neural network (ANN) that could map 2D recordings into 2D eye positions would overcome this problem and improve the utility of EOG. To determine whether ANNs are capable of correctly calibrating the saccadic eye movement data from 2D EOG (i.e. performing the necessary inverse transformation), the ANNs were first tested on data generated from mathematical models of saccadic eye movements. Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with non-linear activation functions and trained with back propagation proved to be capable of calibrating simulated EOG data to a mean accuracy of 0.33&#176; of visual angle (SE = 0.01). Linear perceptrons (LPs) were only nearly half as accurate. For five subjects performing a saccadic eye movement task in the upper right quadrant of the visual field, the mean accuracy provided by the MLPs was 1.07&#176; of visual angle (SE = 0.01) for EOG data, and 0.95&#176; of visual angle (SE = 0.03) for infrared limbus reflection (IRIS&#174;) data. MLPs enabled calibration of 2D saccadic EOG to an accuracy not significantly different to that obtained with the infrared limbus tracking data.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electro-oculogram</field><field name="subject">electrooculogram</field><field name="subject">electro-oculograms</field><field name="subject">electrooculograms</field><field name="subject">electro-oculography</field><field name="subject">electrooculography</field><field name="subject">EOG</field><field name="subject">EOGs</field><field name="subject">artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">ANN</field><field name="subject">ANNs</field><field name="subject">eye movement</field><field name="subject">saccadic eye movements</field><field name="subject">saccades</field><field name="subject">multi-layer perceptrons</field><field name="subject">linear perceptrons</field><field name="subject">calibration</field><field name="subject">backpropagation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030409.110949</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entropy Analysis of an Economic Activity: A Case Study of Simple Brickmaking in China</field><field name="creator">Coulter, John Edward</field><field name="description">1. There is a crisis in economics. The discipline evolved in nineteenth century Europe and is difficult to adapt to modern conditions, even in the West, and particularly in alien cultures. Application of conventional economic analysis to economic activity in a culture as alien as traditional China highlights the biases in assumptions of the paradigm. 2. The concepts, models and vocabulary evolved over one hundred years ago predate important developments in the natural sciences. It is now necessary for economists to concede no goods can ever be 'produced', and they are not 'consumed' either. In clear terms matter is transformed, but is not created or destroyed (First Law of Thermodynamics). 3. When people transform matter, in lay language we say energy is 'used'. In a simple cottage industry, 'raw material' is transformed into a commodity in front of our eyes by the use of human energy and the release of energy from a 'fuel'. In modem complex economic activity, it is difficult or impossible to keep track of the processes from raw matter to transformed 'product' although the principle is the same. 4. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that in any transformation, energy is not created or destroyed, but becomes 'less available'. In short, entropy increases. This appears to work well for pure physics and chemistry, but its application to analysis of economic activity has only been notional. 5.	There is a reason why economists borrowing terms from hard science experience difficulty. It is because physicists and chemists have addressed specific laboratory and engineering problems, but not the broader economic issues. The hypothesis gradually evolved in this research program that not only economic concepts and terms needed reworking, but those in physics as well. The definitions of energy as 'ability to do works and of entropy as 'unavailable energy' jar the logic of our commonsense. 6. The notion of 'available energy' was traced back to the phenomenon in physical chemistry known as exothermicity, or the release of energy during a chemical reaction. It was reasoned that while scientists had focussed on this phenomenon and measured it carefully they saw no need to ask where the energy came from, or to measure its transformation. From the perspective of analysing economic activity, the question was important. 7. It was hypothesised that the energy released from a fuel as electromagnetic radiation (mainly heat) was the residual of the set of coulombic forces within atoms that maintain the structure of shells of electrons around the protons. This idea in turn came from the presumption that molecular bonding is a residual of vectors of the set of coulombic forces within atoms, and the likelihood that in an exothermic reaction, after the reactants are said (by scientists) to 'seek equilibrium', product molecules have a portion of the coulombic forces 'left over' and not required to maintain their structures. An estimate was made of the coulombic forces extant in various fuels, and compared with the known data for their release of energy. 8. The idea was developed in detail. The concept we call in economics, 'production', and should call 'transformation' can only occur when forces locked within atoms are released as electromagnetic forces. (Gravitational forces exist because matter has been put 'there' by electromagnetic radiation). When 100 grams of dry grass fuel is burnt, about 2 megajoules of electromagnetic radiation are released. It was estimated that the coulombic forces between each electron and proton in that amount dry grass total 150 gigajoules (or giganewtons, since the reference is to forces). 9. Within the boundary of a simple economic activity, the ratio of aggregated coulombic forces locked up within atoms to the electromagnetic forces radiated out was estimated at the beginning of the activity, and then after a duration. The ratio of forces always tends towards 'evening out'. This measurement captures the entropy phenomenon which has been said by Georgescu-Roegen to be the basis of all economic activity. 10. At the roots of the economic paradigm founded by Adam Smith is the premise that the material world, as a set of substances, is a stage on which economic actors 'add value', bid prices up and down, and by their rational perception manage their livelihoods and surroundings well. From the findings of this research program it is contended that the surroundings of economic actors can be classed into two categories: locked up (coulombic) electromagnetic forces, and radiated electromagnetic forces. The former has a tendency to convert to the latter. All action, including all economic activity, and all life can be traced to a point in space and time where this conversion is (naturally) occurring. The phenomenon is analogous to a slope where water cascades, and gravitational potential energy converts to other (either useless or useful) forms of energy. To appreciate the nature of this phenomena, and to attempt to fathom its dimensions, sets our perceptions of ourselves as economic actors in a quite different and very humbling context.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entropy analysis</field><field name="subject">thermodynamics</field><field name="subject">Second Law of thermodynamics</field><field name="subject">economics</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">brickmaking</field><field name="subject">brick-making industry</field><field name="subject">locked up electromagnetic forces</field><field name="subject">coulombic electromagnetic forces</field><field name="subject">radiated electromagnetic forces</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070410.170509</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Of The People, By The People, For The People' Workers' Compensation in Queensland: The Rise and Fall of a Policy Community</field><field name="creator">Cowan, Paula</field><field name="description">The central question posed in this thesis is why has the Queensland model of workers' compensation been so enduring?  The legislation remained largely intact from 1916 until 2001, with the exception of the years from 1996 to 1998.  This was so despite the fact the central feature of a state-controlled monopoly that underpinned this model was always potentially divisive in line with the variances between liberal-conservative traditions and social-democratic ideals that subsisted in broader political culture. In addressing this question of longevity, this thesis explores the capacity of an initially contentious piece of legislation to draw strong support from former opponents, and the argument is put forward that it is best explained through the development and operation of a policy community that fostered a shared set of core values relative to broad workers' compensation policy preferences.  These core values were compulsory state monopoly, no fault insurance and full access to common law.  Thus, the longevity of the legislation is attributed to the continued support by key stakeholders of these core values. The thesis also demonstrates that policy community relations deteriorated during the 1990s as governments responded to broader political pressures precipitated by reform agendas.  Inconsistencies in core values and policy outcomes for each stakeholder emerged as governments attempted to assert unprecedented control over the direction of workers' compensation in order to meet broader political goals. The legislation was threatened as relations within the policy community proved unsustainable when existing core values were contested.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Workers' compensation model</field><field name="subject">core value in government</field><field name="subject">state-controlled monopoly</field><field name="subject">policy community</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060223.103131</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Speech Environmental Sound Classification System for Autonomous Surveillance</field><field name="creator">Cowling, Michael</field><field name="description">Sound is one of a human beings most important senses. After vision, it is the sense most used to gather information about the environment. Despite this, comparatively little research has been done into the field of sound recognition. The research that has been done mainly centres around the recognition of speech and music. Our auditory environment is made up of many sounds other than speech and music. This sound information can be taped into for the benefit of specific applications such as security systems. Currently, most researchers are ignoring this sound information. This thesis investigates techniques to recognise environmental non-speech sounds and their direction, with the purpose of using these techniques in an autonomous mobile surveillance robot. It also presents advanced methods to improve the accuracy and efficiency of these techniques. Initially, this report presents an extensive literature survey, looking at the few existing techniques for non-speech environmental sound recognition. This survey also, by necessity, investigates existing techniques used for sound recognition in speech and music. It also examines techniques used for direction detection of sounds.  The techniques that have been identified are then comprehensively compared to determine the most appropriate techniques for non-speech sound recognition. A comprehensive comparison is performed using non-speech sounds and several runs are performed to ensure accuracy. These techniques are then ranked based on their effectiveness. The best technique is found to be either Continuous Wavelet Transform feature extraction with Dynamic Time Warping or Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients with Dynamic Time Warping. Both of these techniques achieve a 70% recognition rate. Once the best of the existing classification techniques is identified, the problem of uncountable sounds in the environment can be addressed. Unlike speech recognition, non-speech sound recognition requires recognition from a much wider library of sounds. Due to this near-infinite set of example sounds, the characteristics and complexity of non-speech sound recognition techniques increases. To address this problem, a systematic scheme needs to be developed for non-speech sound classification. Several different approaches are examined. Included is a new design for an environmental sound taxonomy based on an environmental sound alphabet. This taxonomy works over three levels and classifies sounds based on their physical characteristics. Its performance is compared with a technique that generates a structured tree automatically. These structured techniques are compared for different data sets and results are analysed. Comparable results are achieved for these techniques with the same data set as previously used. In addition, the results and greater information from these experiments is used to infer some information about the structure of environmental sounds in general. Finally, conclusions are drawn on both sets of techniques and areas of future research stemming from this thesis are explored.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sound recognition</field><field name="subject">speech</field><field name="subject">non-speech</field><field name="subject">autonomous surveillance</field><field name="subject">robot</field><field name="subject">robots</field><field name="subject">robotics</field><field name="subject">classification</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040428.152425</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship Between Sociocultural Influences and Disordered Eating Behaviours: Age-Related Differences in an Integrated Theoretical Model.</field><field name="creator">Coyne, Lucy C</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to a growing body of research examining the relationship between sociocultural influences and disordered eating behaviour. The aim of the current research was to extend on previously developed theoretical models to more closely examine agerelated differences in an integrated sociocultural model of disordered eating behaviour. The proposed model was informed by components of the dual-pathway model and the tripartite influence model. Nine-hundred and ninety-five women, from four different age groups (i.e., preadolescent, early adolescent, late adolescent and young adult), completed self-report measures of perceived pressure to be thin, modelling of disordered eating behaviour, media exposure, internalisation of the thin-ideal, social comparison, body dissatisfaction, body mass index, and disordered eating behaviour. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques, a sociocultural model of disordered eating was tested and found to have good fit to the data. A number of age-related differences in the strength of the relationship between variables were found. Interestingly, modelling of disordered eating behaviour was a direct predictor of disordered eating behaviour regardless of age group. As expected internalisation of the thin-ideal mediated between perceived pressure to be thin and body dissatisfaction for all age groups. Surprisingly, media exposure had few effects on internalisation, but was more strongly related to social comparison for the late adolescent and young adult age groups. Social comparison played a less significant role in predicting body dissatisfaction in preadolescent girls. However, for all other participants, social comparison predicted internalisation of the thin-ideal, body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviour. As expected, BMI predicted body dissatisfaction, and body dissatisfaction predicted disordered eating behaviour. The models accounted for between 60-64% of the variance in disordered eating behaviour. Implications for prevention programs are discussed in light of these findings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociocultural</field><field name="subject">Eating Behaviours</field><field name="subject">Disordered</field><field name="subject">Age-Related</field><field name="subject">Theoretical Model</field><field name="subject">Integrated</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20071114.081853</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploratory Study of the Social Psychological Determinants of Regular Participation in Leisure-Time Physical Activity</field><field name="creator">Craike, Melinda Jane</field><field name="description">Despite the widely documented physical, psychological, and social benefits of regular participation in physical activity (Bauman &amp; Campbell, 2001; Blair, Kohl &amp; Barlow, 1995; Paluska &amp; Schwenk, 2000; U.S Department of Health &amp; Human Services, 1996), less than half of the Australian population participate in 'sufficient' levels of physical activity in terms of time and frequency of participation (Bauman, Ford &amp; Armstrong, 2001).  Thus the examination of social psychological determinants of regular participation in leisure-time physical activity is important. A mixed methods approach was adopted to identify and test the important social psychological determinants of regular participation in leisure-time physical activity.  Phase one of the study was qualitative in nature and adopted a grounded theory approach.  A number of important themes emerged from the qualitative phase, including: definitions and meanings of physical activity; physical activity and choice, obligation, reasons for participation; enjoyment of physical activity; changing perceptions and influences on physical activity from childhood to adulthood; and priority of physical activity.  The interrelations between these themes and their impact on regularity of participation were explored.  These findings, along with theoretical propositions and evidence from previous studies, contributed to the development of a model of the social psychological determinants of regular participation in leisure-time physical activity.  They also contributed to the development of items to measure important concepts in the model.  Phase two was quantitative in nature and used structural equation modelling to test the model. The quantitative phase involved a sample of 250 people aged 19-87 years living in an Australian capital city.  Self-report questionnaires measured regularity of participation in leisure-time physical activity (dependent variable), leisure-time physical activity behaviour regulation, intrinsic motivation towards leisure-time physical activity, enjoyment of leisure-time physical activity, and priority of leisure-time physical activity (independent and mediating variables).  Each of the independent and mediating variables was multidimensional in nature, the components of which were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis in structural equation modelling prior to the testing of structural models.  After some adjustment, the predictors were satisfactorily represented by their respective multifactor models, except intrinsic motivation, which was best represented by a single factor model. Following modification, the proposed model of the social psychological determinants of regular participation in leisure-time physical activity was found to be a good fit of the data.  Relationships within the model indicated the importance of the priority of leisure-time physical activity factors in the prediction of regular participation in leisure-time physical activity.  The influence of preference for leisure-time physical activity on regular participation in leisure-time physical activity was mediated by level of priority and making time for leisure-time physical activity.  That is, people who preferred to participate in leisure-time physical activity over other types of leisure tended to make it a higher priority, and, in turn, tended to make time to participate.  Making time was subsequently associated with increased regularity of participation in leisure-time physical activity. The enjoyment factors influenced regular participation in leisure-time physical activity through their influence on preference for leisure-time physical activity.  Activity enjoyment had a positive influence on preference and enjoyment dependent on surroundings had a negative influence.  However, in the overall model, the behaviour regulators and intrinsic motivation attenuated the influence of the enjoyment factors on preference for leisure-time physical activity.  This suggested that people's underlying behaviour regulators and levels of intrinsic motivation have a similar influence on their preference for leisure-time physical activity as their feelings of enjoyment.  However, behaviour regulators and intrinsic motivation appear to be more powerful influences of preference than enjoyment. Intrinsic motivation towards leisure-time physical activity positively influenced regular participation in leisure-time physical activity through its influence on preference for leisure-time physical activity.  It also had a direct influence on regularity of participation.  Thus, people who were more intrinsically motivated tended to participate more regularly in leisure-time physical activity partly because they formed preferences for physical activity over other types of leisure.  Furthermore, the direct influence of intrinsic motivation on regular participation suggested that there were explanations, beyond that of preference and priority, for why those who were intrinsically motivated tended to participate more regularly in leisure-time physical activity. The behaviour regulators of external regulation (negative), introjected regulation (positive) and identified regulation (positive) influenced regularity of participation in leisure-time physical activity mostly through their influence on intrinsic motivation towards leisure-time physical activity.  That is, when people felt their physical activity was externally regulated, they felt less intrinsically motivated to participate and this was subsequently associated with less regular participation.  On the other hand, when people were regulated by introjection and identification, they tended to feel more intrinsically motivated and this was subsequently associated with more regular participation.  External regulation and introjected regulation also had a direct negative influence on preference for leisure-time physical activity and perceptions of the availability of time, respectively.  Thus, people who felt externally regulated tended to have less preference for leisure-time physical activity and those who were regulated through introjection were more likely to perceive that they did not have the time to participate. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by highlighting the importance of preferences and prioritisation on perceptions of time availability, and subsequently, regularity of participation in leisure-time physical activity.  It also demonstrated that behaviour regulators and intrinsic motivation are important determinants of regular participation in leisure-time physical activity in a general community sample.  These findings have theoretical and practical implications for researchers, leisure professionals, and policy makers.  They also suggest a number of significant areas of further research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leisure time physical activity</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">self-determination theory</field><field name="subject">intrinsic motivation</field><field name="subject">behaviour regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060810.154920</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differential Gene Expression in Pathological and Physiological Cardiac Hypertrophy</field><field name="creator">Crampton, Matthew S</field><field name="description">Cardiac hypertrophy defines an adaptive process brought about in response to sustained increases in haemodynamic work. Cardiomyocytes undergo an initial compensatory phase in which enlargement and contractility alterations normalise wall stress and maintain adequate perfusion of organs. In pathological hypertrophy, this deteriorates to a decompensated state characterised by ventricular dysfunction and predisposition to heart failure. In contrast, physiological hypertrophy and associated enhanced cardiac functioning arising from chronic exercise training does not progress to heart failure. Determination of the molecular pathways underlying myocardial hypertrophy remains a challenge for cardiovascular research. The objective of the work presented in this thesis was to identify genes differentially expressed during pathological and physiological hypertrophy in order to enhance our knowledge of the mechanistic processes involved. A reverse Northern hybridisation method was applied to profile the expression of specifically selected genes in the hypertrophic models examined. Functional categories represented in the gene panel assembled included cardiac contractile and cytoskeletal markers, matrix metalloproteinases, vasoactive pathway factors, calcium handling genes, ion channels, cardiac regulatory factors, signalling pathway intermediates, apoptotic factors and histone deacetylases. In order to investigate pathological hypertrophy, a deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt) rat model was utilised. DOCA-salt treated rats used in this study demonstrated a 1.4-fold increase in heart weight to body weight ratio compared to controls. Impaired cardiac function indicative of a decompensated pathological phenotype in the DOCA-salt treated group was demonstrated by way of decreased chamber size, impaired myocardial compliance and significantly reduced cardiac output. Reverse Northern hybridisation analysis of 95 selected genes identified a number of candidates with differential expression in hearts of DOCA-salt treated rats. Increased gene expression was demonstrated for the collagenase MMP1 and stress-activated signal transduction factor Sin1. In contrast, the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase SERCA-2 and anti-apoptotic factor BCL2l-10 genes exhibited decreased expression. To investigate changes in gene expression associated with physiological hypertrophy, use was made of an endurance run-trained rat model. The run-trained rats used in this study demonstrated a 24.1% increase in heart weight to body weight ratio and improvements in performance consistent with physiological cardiac adaptation. These performance indicators included improvements in systolic volume, cardiac output, myocardial compliance and bio-energetic function. Reverse Northern hybridisation expression analysis of 56 genes identified a number of differentially expressed mRNA transcripts in run-trained hypertrophied hearts. Four genes shown to demonstrate reduced expression in the run-trained rat model were interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK1) and the developmentally expressed transcription factors Nkx-2.3, dHAND, and IRX-2. Based upon the reverse Northern hybridisation results, four genes were selected for Western blotting analysis of rat cardiac tissue. Of these, MMP1 and a putative isoform of Sin1 exhibited increased levels in DOCA-salt treated hypertrophic left ventricular tissue, results that correlate with the findings of increased mRNA expression for these two genes. Therefore, this study identified MMP1 and Sin1 as candidates involved in pathological but not physiological hypertrophy. This finding is in accord with other recent investigations demonstrating that pathological hypertrophy and physiological hypertrophy are associated with distinct molecular phenotypes. An aside to the major objective of identifying genes differentially regulated in left ventricular hypertrophy involved the application of the P19CL6 cell in vitro model of cardiomyogenesis to compare protein expression during hypertrophy and development. The Sin1 isoform, found to be up-regulated during DOCA-salt induced hypertrophy, was also shown to be more abundant in differentiating, than non-differentiating, P19CL6 cells. This result is consistent with the developing paradigm that implicates 'fetal' genes in the hypertrophic remodelling process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiac hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">cardiomyocytes</field><field name="subject">pathological hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">physiological hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">myocardial hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">Northern hybridisation analysis</field><field name="subject">differential gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070104.165826</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bad Behaviour: The Prevention of Usability Problems Using GSE Models</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Alistair</field><field name="description">The aim of Human Computer Interaction or HCI is to both understand and improve the quality of the users' experience with the systems and technology they interact with. Recent HCI research requirements have stated a need for a unified predictive approach to system design that consolidates system engineering, cognitive modelling, and design principles into a single 'total system approach.' At present, few methods seek to integrate all three of these aspects into a single method and of those that do many are extensions to existing engineering techniques. This thesis, however proposes a new behaviour based approach designed to identify usability problems early in the design process before testing the system with actual users. In order to address the research requirements, this model uses a new design notation called Genetic Software Engineering (GSE) in conjunction with aspects of a cognitive modelling technique called NGOMSL (Natural GOMS Language) as the basis for this approach. GSE's behaviour tree notation, and NGOMSL's goal orientated format are integrated using a set of simple conversion rules defined in this study. Several well established design principles, believed to contribute to the eventual usability of a product, are then modelled in GSE. This thesis addresses the design of simple interfaces and the design of complex ubiquitous technology. The new GSE approach is used to model and predict usability problems in an extensive range of tasks from programming a VCR to making a video recording on a modern mobile phone. The validity of these findings is tested against actual user tests on the same tasks and devices to demonstrate the effectiveness of the GSE approach. Ultimately, the aim of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new cognitive and engineering based approach at predicting usability problems based on tangible representations of established design principles. This both fulfils the MCI research requirements for a 'total system approach' and establishes a new and novel approach to user interface and system design.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human computer interaction</field><field name="subject">genetic software engineering</field><field name="subject">natural GOMS language</field><field name="subject">cognitive modelling technique</field><field name="subject">user interface</field><field name="subject">system design</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061108.154141</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Birthing and the development of trauma symptoms: Incidence and contributing factors</field><field name="creator">Creedy, Debra Kay</field><field name="description">Background: Little is known about the relationship between women's birthing experiences and the development of trauma symptoms. This study aimed to determine the incidence of acute trauma symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women as a result of their labor and delivery experiences, and identify factors that contributed to the women's psychological distress. Method: Using a prospective, longitudinal design, women in their last trimester of pregnancy were recruited from four public hospital antenatal clinics. Four to six weeks postpartum, telephone interviews were conducted with participants (n = 499) and explored the medical and midwifery management of the birth, perceptions of intrapartum care, and the presence of trauma symptoms. Results: One in three women (33%) identified a traumatic birthing event and reported the presence of at least three trauma symptoms. Twenty-eight women (5.6%) met DSM-IV criteria for acute posttraumatic stress disorder. Antenatal variables were not found to contribute to the development of acute or chronic trauma symptoms. The level of obstetric intervention experienced during childbirth (beta = .351, p &lt;.0001) and the perception of inadequate intrapartum care (beta = .319, p &lt;.0001) during labor were consistently associated with the development of acute trauma symptoms. Conclusions: Posttraumatic stress disorder following childbirth is an under-recognized phenomenon. Women who experienced both a high level of obstetric intervention and were dissatisfied with their intrapartum care were more likely to develop trauma symptoms than women who received a high level of obstetric intervention or women who perceived their care to be inadequate. Such findings should prompt a serious review of intrusive obstetric intervention during labor and delivery, and the psychological care provided to birthing women.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childbirth</field><field name="subject">trauma symptoms</field><field name="subject">posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">antenatal</field><field name="subject">obstetric intervention</field><field name="subject">satisfaction with care</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030102.101015</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ARTSongs: The Soul Beneath My Skin</field><field name="creator">Croft, Pamela Joy</field><field name="description">This exegesis frames my studio thesis, which explores whether visual art can be a site for reconciliation, a tool for healing, an educational experience and a political act. It details how my art work evolved as a series of cycles and stages, as a systematic engagement with people, involving them in a process of investigating 'their' own realities - both the stories of their inner worlds and the community story framework of their outer conditions. It reveals how for my ongoing work as an indigenous artist, I became the learner and the teacher, the subject and the object. Of central importance for my exploration was the concept and methodology of bothways. As a social process, bothways action-learning methodology was found to incorporate the needs, motivations and cultural values of the learner through negotiated learning. Discussion of bothways methodology and disciplinary context demonstrated the relationships, connections and disjunctions shared by both Aboriginal and Western domains and informed the processes and techniques to position visual art as an educational experience and a tool for healing. From this emerged a range of ARTsongs - installations which reveal possible new alternatives sites for reconciliation, spaces and frames of reference to 'open our minds, heart and spirit so we can know beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable, so that we can think and rethink, so that we can create new visions, transgressions - a movement against and beyond boundaries' (hooks, 1994 p.12). Central to studio production was bricolage as an artistic strategy and my commitment to praxis  - to weaving together my art practice with hands-on political action and direct involvement with my communities. I refer to this as the trial and feedback process or SIDEtracks. These were documented acts of personal empowerment, which led to a more activist role in the political struggle of reconciliation. I conclude that, as aboriginal people, we can provide a leadership role, and in so doing, we can demonstrate to the wider community how to move beyond a state of apathy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">installations</field><field name="subject">installation art</field><field name="subject">bricolage</field><field name="subject">Australian aboriginal artists</field><field name="subject">minority art</field><field name="subject">minority arts</field><field name="subject">reconciliation</field><field name="subject">race relations</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030807.124830</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Biogeochemical Modelling Analysis of the Potential For Marine Ecosystems to Regulate Climate By the Production of Dimethylsulphide</field><field name="creator">Cropp, Roger Allan</field><field name="description">The potential for life to control its environment was first suggested by Lovelock (1972). Charlson et al (1987) proposed a role for marine planktonic ecosystems in global climate regulation via the production and ventilation to the atmosphere of dimethylsulphide (DMS), a by-product of phytoplankton metabolism. Once in the atmosphere DMS contributes to the formation of cloud condensation nuclei, and increases the amount and brightness of cloud. This affects the albedo of the planet, reflecting more incident sunlight back into space, and cooling the earth. In common with many other 'hypotheses' regarding complex adaptive systems, the hypothesis proposed by Charlson et al (1987) is not experimentally testable. The production and ventilation to the atmosphere of DMS is the result of complex interactions between biological, chemical and physical processes. Consequently, increasing use is being made of mathematical models that simulate these processes to advance understanding of it (Archer et al. 2002). This study examines one of the fundamental mechanisms proposed by the Charlson et al (1987) hypothesis, that increasing global temperatures will lead to increased ventilation of DMS from the ocean to the atmosphere. The study develops one-dimensional biogeochemical models of DMS production by upper ocean ecosystems, based on the model proposed by Gabric et al. (1993b). The models are examined to elucidate their fundamental mathematical properties, and are subjected to sensitivity analysis to identify important processes and parameters. These investigations identify a simpler model that can reproduce the predictions of the Gabric et al. (1993b) model. Predictions derived from model simulations forced by climatologies of measured physical data are compared to a global database of measurements of sea surface DMS concentrations, and to observed depth profiles of DMS in the upper ocean. These comparisons confirm that all models are in good qualitative agreement with measured data. The fifteen global climate prediction models currently in use around the globe all predict substantial warming effects from the ventilation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. A simplified DMS model is calibrated to climatologies of Antarctic chlorophyll and DMS data and reproduces the data with great precision. The calibrated model is applied in global warming scenarios to 'test' the efficacy of the mechanism proposed by the Charlson et al (1987) hypothesis. This simulation provides evidence that the response predicted by the hypothesis is indeed feasible, and that substantial increases (up to 45%) in the ventilation of DMS to the atmosphere could be possible in some circumstances. The results of the modelling study provide impetus for further examination of field data. If couplings between marine biota and atmosphere are feasible, then they may be operating contemporarily, and may be detectable. Atmospheric DMS is oxidised to form aerosols (Miller et al. 2002) that influence the aerosol optical depth of the atmosphere. Archives of remote sensed ocean chlorophyll a concentration and aerosol optical depth are examined for evidence of the biologically mediated couplings. A clear coupling between aeolian dust and marine phytoplankton is evident from this analysis, suggesting that the deposition of dust from the atmosphere is a major factor controlling phytoplankton growth in many parts of the ocean. A second coupling between marine phytoplankton and atmospheric aerosols is also detected. This coupling is apparently not related to dust and is symmetrical about the equator, despite the substantial differences in the atmospheres and oceans of each hemisphere. It is speculated that this coupling may reflect the influence of the ventilation of DMS produced by marine phytoplankton on the atmosphere. This thesis provides new evidence supporting the important role of marine ecosystems in global climate regulation by the production of DMS. This evidence is principally obtained from a biogeochemical modelling approach, but is supported by analyses of empirical data. The concordance of results obtained from different approaches suggests that the contribution of marine ecosystems to global climate regulation is real, important and currently active.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biogeochemical modelling</field><field name="subject">ecosystem modelling</field><field name="subject">dimethylsulphide</field><field name="subject">DMS</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">marine ecosystems</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030703.101310</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colonialism's Paradox: White Women, 'Race' and Gender in the Contact Zone 1850-1910</field><field name="creator">Crow, Rebekah</field><field name="description">This thesis is both an empirical history of white women in Queensland colonialism and a theoretical history of colonialism and imperialism in the late nineteenth century. It is a feminist history which seeks to fill the gap in our understanding of white women and 'race' in the contact zone in Queensland in the nineteenth century. At this level the thesis restores historical agency to women and reveals women's history as a powerful alternative to traditional colonial histories. It also positions this Queensland history within a global discourse of critical imperial histories that has emerged over the past decade, seeking to understand how British imperialism and Queensland colonialism shaped and informed each other in a two way process. The central themes of the thesis are 'race' and gender. I examine the ways in which white women deploy imperial ideologies of 'race' in the contact zone to position themselves as white women. 'Race' and gender are explored through the ways in which white women negotiated, in their writing, their relationships with Indigenous people and Pacific Islanders on the frontier and in the contact zone. The white women whose texts are examined in this thesis engaged with 'race' difference in their autobiographical accounts and these accounts, on many levels, allow us to rethink colonial history. I argue that colonialism is paradoxical and that white women experienced this colonial paradox in their daily lives and negotiated it in their writing. The white women whose writing is studied here were decent people with good intentions. They were simultaneously humanitarians (to differing degrees) and colonists. They were dependant for their livelihoods upon a violent colonisation and yet they were sympathetic to the Aboriginal people they interacted with. Often they were silenced in their opinions on the violence they witnessed. Writing was a means of navigating these contradictions. White women were in a relatively powerless position in the contact zone and there was little they could do to mitigate the violence that they saw. The tensions that resulted from living in the colonial paradox on frontiers and in the contact zone, of being a colonists and humanitarians, and of living in an uncontrollable existential situation is expressed in the writing of these women. This history offers us a more holistic understanding of the complexity of colonialism in Australia.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White women in Queensland</field><field name="subject">colonialism</field><field name="subject">imperialism</field><field name="subject">Queensland history</field><field name="subject">race and gender</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061009.115837</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Candidate Gene Analysis of Migraine Susceptibility Regions on Chromosome 1q and 19p</field><field name="creator">Curtain, Robert</field><field name="description">Migraine is a common, debilitating neurovascular disease charactensed by severe recurrent headache, nausea and vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. It is clinically diagnosed based on criteria specified by the International Headache Society (IHS), defining two major classes of migraine: migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO) MA sufferers experience neurovascular disturbances that precede the headache phase of an attack. Although migraine is partly influenced by environmental determinants, there is a significant genetic component, with disease heritability estimated to be up to 60% and mode of transmission multifactorial. The disorder is common with a large Dutch study reporting lifetime prevalence estimates of 33% in women and 13.3% in men, with an earlier study estimating 24% of women and 12% of men in the overall population. Mutations in various ion channel genes are responsible for neuromuscular and other neurological disorders. Inherited ion channel mutations or 'channelopathies' are increasingly found to be the cause of various neurological disorders in humans. In familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), a rare subtype of migraine with aura, mutations in the CACNA1A gene (localised at C19p13) have been fbund (FHM1). This gene codes for the alphalA subunit of the neuronal voltage-dependent P/Q-type calcium channel. Recently a second gene, ATP1A2 (FHM2) (localised at C1q23), was implicated in some EHM families. The ATP1A2 ion channel gene, codes for the alpha2 subunit of the Na+, K+ ion ATPase pump. These findings of mutations in these genes have focused attention on central nervous system ionic channels and helped to better understand EHM pathophysiology, where the best genetic evidence providing molecular insight into migraine still comes flom the mutations detected in the rare form of migraine with aura; FHM. Migraine family studies, at the Genomic Research Centre (GRC), have utilised linkage analysis methods in providing results that have indicated suggestive linkage to the FHM1-CACNA1A region on l9p13, in a large multigenerational family (Migraine Family 1; MEl) affected with typical migraine. Also linkage studies conducted within the GRC have implicated an additional susceptibility region on chromosome 1q31, but still not ruling out a second susceptibility region on C1q23, with the possibility of there being two distinct loci, on the chromosome lq region. The focus of research in this thesis is on two main chromosomal regions, which were tested for migraine susceptibility on chromosome 1 and chromosome 19. The research involved a cross-disciplinary approach utilising association, linkage and mutation screening approaches. Allelic candidate gene studies can provide a suitable method for locating genes of small effect that contribute to complex genetic disorders, such as migraine. Family linkage studies are useful for detection of chromosomal susceptibility regions and association studies are powerful when a plausible candidate gene and a sequence variant with potential functional relevance is examined. Mutation screening studies can indicate a direct cause of disorders such as migraine, where possible sequence variants may alter the translation of proteins in genes, causing the disease. The first gene exanted on chromosome 19 was that of the Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR) gene. The LDLR gene is a cell surface receptor that plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis. We investigated the (TA)n polymorphism in exon 18 of the LDLR gene on chromosome l9pl3.2 performing an association analysis in 244 typical migraine affected patients, 151 suffering from migraine with aura, 96 with migraine without aura and 244 unaffected controls. The populations consisted of Caucasians only and controls were age and sex matched. The results showed no significant difference between groups for allele frequency distributions of the (TA)n polymorphism even after separation of the migraine affected individuals into subgroups of MA and MO affected patients. This is in contradiction to Mochi et al, 2003 who found a positive association of this variant with MO. Our study discusses possible differences between the two studies and extends this research by investigating circulating cholesterol levels in a migraine affected genetically-isolated population. Another gene examined on chromosome l9pl3 was the insulin receptor gene (1NSR). The aim of this study was to investigate through direct sequencing the INSR gene in DNA samples from a migraine affected family previously showing linkage to chromosome l9pl3 in an attempt to detect disease associated mutations. The insulin receptor gene (INSR) on chromosome 19pl3.3-13.2 is a gene of interest since a number of SNPs located within the gene have been implicated in migraine with (MA) and without aura (MO). Six DNA samples obtained from non-founding migraine affected members of migraine family one (MF 1) were used in this study. Genomic DNA was sequenced for the 1NSR gene in exons 1-22 and the promoter region. In the six migraine family member samples, previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP5) were detected within two exonic DNA coding regions of the INSR gene. These SNPs, in exon 13 and 17, do not alter the normal INSR polypeptide sequence. In addition, intron 7 also revealed a DNA base sequence variation. For the 5' untranslated promoter region of the gene, no mutations were detected. In conclusion, this study detected no INSR mutations in affected members of a chromosome 19 linked migraine pedigree. Hence, migraine linkage to this chromosomal region may involve other candidate genes. The NOTCH3 gene on C19p13.2-p13.l has previously been shown to be a gene involved in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and may also be implicated in migraine as there are some symptom similarities between the two disorders. The TNFSF7 gene localised on Cl9pl3 is homologous to the ligands of the TNF receptor family, including TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, genes that have both been previously associated with migraine. This study investigated the migraine susceptibility locus at Cl9p13 studying two genes that may be involved in the disorder. The NOTCH3 gene was analysed by sequencing all exons with known CADASIL mutations in a family (MF1) that has previously been shown to be linked to Cl9pl3. The sequencing results for affected members of this pedigree proved to be negative for all known sequence variants giving rise to mutation causing amino acid changes for CADASIL. The direct sequencing results displayed that of a normal coding sequence for the NOTCH3 gene F or the TNFSF7 gene, this was investigated through SNP association analysis using a matched case-control migraine diagnosed population. Chi-square results showed non-significant P values across all populations tested against controls except for the MO subgroup which displayed a weak association with the TNFSF7 SNP (genotype, allele analysis P = 0.036, P = 0 017 respectively). Our results suggest that common migraine is not caused by any known CADASIL mutations in the NOTCH3 gene of interest however, the TNFSF7 gene displayed signs of involvement in a MO affected population, but, further studies are needed to confirm these results and to further explore a TNF receptor - migraine potential interaction. A final examination on chromosome 19 involved a case report of an extremely rare and severe form of migraine. As stated earlier Familial Hemiplegic Migraine (FHM) is a severe rare sub-type of migraine and gene mutations on chromosome 19 have been identified in the calcium channel gene CACNA1A (Cl9pl3) fOr FHM. Recently a gene mutation (S218L) for a dramatic syndrome originating from FHM, commonly named 'migraine coma', has implicated exon 5 of the CACNA1A gene. The occurrence of trivial head trauma, in FHM patients, may also be complicated by severe, sometimes even fatal, cerebral edema and coma occurring after a lucid interval. Hemiplegic migraine has also been found to be sporadic in which both forms share a similar spectrum of clinical presentations and genetic heterogeneity. The case report presented in this study enhances the involvement of the S218L CACNA1A mutation in the extremely rare disorder of minor head trauma induced migraine coma. It not only proves to be a powerful diagnostic tool in detecting cases of FHM head trauma induced coma but also for sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM) coma subjects. We conclude from this case study that the S218L mutation, in the CACNA1A calcium channel subunit gene, is involved in sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM), delayed cerebral edema and coma after minor head trauma. This thesis also involved analysis of chromosome 1 for migraine susceptibility, where FHM studies provided a foundation fOr common migraine research on chromosome 1. Studies have suggested that mutations in the CACNA1A gene on chromosome l9p cause FHM in only approximately 50% of affected pedigrees. The CACNAIA gene has previously been tested, within the Genomics Research Centre, in the common forms of migraine; however no new mutations or the FHM mutations were detected in these MA/MO affected samples. A second FHM susceptibility locus maps to chromosome 1q23 and mutations in the ATP1A2 gene have recently been implicated in two Cl-linked FHM pedigrees. As FHM is considered a rare and severe form of MA, it is possible that the chromosome 1q23 locus, and the ATP1A2 gene, may be involved in the common forms of migraine with (MA) and possibly without aura (MO). Also, we have previously reported evidence of linkage to microsatellite markers on chromosome 1q31 in a large pedigree affected predominately with MA, which suggests the possibility that there are two distinct loci for migraine susceptibility on chromosome 1. The objectives of this study were to extend our linkage analysis of chromosome lq microsatellite markers in predominantly migraine with aura pedigrees. Also, our aim was to test the novel FHM-2 ATP1A2 gene for involvement in these migraine affected pedigrees and a previous pedigree (Migraine Family 14; MF 14) showing evidence of linkage of markers to Clq31. This was performed by a chromosome 1 scan (31 markers) in 21 multiplex pedigrees affected mainly with MA. Also, the known FHM-2 ATP1A2 gene mutations were tested, by sequencing, fOr involvement in MA and MO in these pedigrees. Mutation screening by direct sequencing was also performed throughout the coding areas of the ATP1A2 gene in 3 MA individuals fiom MF14. The results of this study detected evidence for linkage in our migraine pedigrees at chromosome 1q23, to microsatellite markers spanning the ATP1A2 (FHM-2) gene. However testing of the known ATP1A2 gene mutations (for FHM) in migraine probands of pedigrees showing excess allele sharing was negative, with no mutations detected in these migraineurs. Sequencing of the entire coding areas of the gene through 3 MA affecteds from MF14, a pedigree showing significant linkage to this region, was also negative for mutations. In conclusion, this study reported that microsatellite markers on chromosome 1q23 show evidence of excess allele sharing in MA and some MO pedigrees, suggesting linkage to the common forms of migraine and the presence of a susceptibility gene in this region. The new FHM-2 (ATPIA2 gene) mutations reported by Fusco et al, 2003 do not cause migraine in probands of affected pedigrees showing excess allele sharing to markers in this genomic region. Also no mutations were detected in all exons of the ATP1A2 gene in 3 MA affected individuals from a large pedigree (MF14) showing linkage to this region. Investigation in this thesis continued on chromosome 1, with other genes being examined on C1q23, as well as the C1q31 region for a migraine susceptibility locus or gene. Previously in our laboratory, evidence for linkage was shown to migraine at C1q31 in one family predominantly affected with MA, with microsatellite markers in this region. The initial Cl study (above; ATP1A2 gene) has also provided evidence for linkage to the chromosome 1 locus 1q23, with evidence for excess allele sharing of markers in predominantly MA affected pedigrees. To further investigate both chromosome I loci, an investigation with six candidate genes that lie within the C1q23 and 1q31 regions through association analysis was undertaken. The results from this study reported non-significant chi-square results, showing P values greater than 0.05 across all SNPs (and a CA rpt) tested. An exception was the rs704326 SNP from exon 43 of the CACNA1E gene on C1q31. P values significantly less than 0.001 were obtained in the total migraine population and the MA subgroup, with similar frequency comparisons ascertained in both genotype and allele analysis. Examination through contingency table analysis of the CACNA1E flequency data indicated that the risk allele (A) was over-represented in the migraine group compared to the control group. Further comparison of the genotype data indicated a difference in frequency distributions (P less than 0 0001). Stratified analyses of migraine subtypes indicated that this association was specifically attributed to the MA subtype group. Odds ratios produced an OR of 4.14 with a 95% CI of 2.36 - 7.26 (P less than 0.0001). The positive association results obtained within the CACNA1E gene are interesting in the fact that FHM is considered to be a rare and severe form of migraine with aura (MA) and FHM-1 is caused by mutations contained within the calcium channel gene CACNA1A (localized at Cl9p13). The idea that FHM and specifically an FHM gene in the C1q31 genomic region may also contribute to susceptibility to the more common forms of migraine i e. migraine with aura, strongly supports and reinforces the idea that a common defective gene may be influencing both FHM and typical migraine. In conclusion, this thesis undertook a cross-disciplinary approach to genetic research of a complex disorder. The research involved linkage, association and mutation analysis strategies of migraine. This research implicated a specific variant on chromosome 1 and further supported the heterogeneic nature of migraine. Future directions into migraine research should involve further investigation of this specific variant and this genomic region. Such studies may aid in the development of more precise diagnosis and treatment methods for this complex disorder.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Migraine research</field><field name="subject">migraine with aura</field><field name="subject">migraine without aura</field><field name="subject">CACNA1A gene</field><field name="subject">insulin receptor gene</field><field name="subject">19p13.3</field><field name="subject">single nucleotide polymorphisms</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070810.132610</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Made in the Image of the Church: The Transmission of Church-Based Values</field><field name="creator">Dalseno, Michael Peter</field><field name="description">Following the completion of four minor research projects as part of a doctoral program at Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia, the writer developed an interest in the church-based values and beliefs held by students in Ministry Training Colleges (MTCs). The four minor projects revealed that a strongly embedded culture seemed to exist within the Assemblies Of God (AOG) in Australia. The aim of this study was to investigate the transmission of church-based values to students in an AOG, Ministry Training College (MTC) context. It undertakes this task by asking five Research Questions: What values are transmitted in AOG church contexts? ; From what principal sources do the values come? ; Why are the values transmitted in AOG church contexts? ; How, and by what means, are these values transmitted? ; and How and why would students choose to acquire these values? After briefly describing the religious context in Australia, defining the meaning of values, and examining various models of transfer, the dissertation includes a review of the literature relevant to values processes. The review is organized according to the Research Questions. From this, a theoretical explanation is produced that anticipates how values processes may impact on MTC students in an AOG context. A suitable method was selected, namely interactive interviews, from which to obtain data relevant to the Research Questions. Six student subjects from a MTC in Australia, as a selected group of AOG participants, were subsequently interviewed and the data were organized, presented and analyzed. The data analysis and interpretation confirmed the theoretical position taken as far as their overall applicability to values transfer was concerned, namely: the values transmitted are primarily charismatic values, with some lesser emphasis on character values; the sources from which the values come are primarily Christian-influenced; the values are transmitted in AOG contexts because AOG churches, departments and ministries aim to be change agents in the community, to promote church continuance, and to a lesser extent, to motivate their members; the values are transmitted through various AOG communicative methods and through utilizing suitable venues for facilitating transmission. Low-Road conditions (i.e., transferring values across highly similar situations) are utilized; and MTC students choose to acquire values because of their personal interests and passions, including their desire to be accepted within the AOG church. However, the data also indicate that the unique, personal characteristics of MTC students strongly impact on the way they engage with values processes. In short, the students are highly compliant and committed to the church. However, each student respondent has his/her own set of reasons and characteristics for cooperating with church-based values. The dissertation concludes by identifying a number of issues raised by the data, that need further investigation, and by discussing some of the implications arising from the data. Its key finding is that AOG students tend to eagerly acquire church-based values, even though they have different reasons for doing so, and that they present themselves to the AOG church as highly compliant. In this sense, students may be seen as &amp;quotmade in the image of the church&amp;quot.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">christian education</field><field name="subject">minister training</field><field name="subject">Assemblies of God</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">values</field><field name="subject">church-based values</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030731.102027</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influences on and Effectiveness of Environmemntal Policy-Making and Implementation in Japan: The Issue of Wildlife Preservation</field><field name="creator">Danaher, Mike</field><field name="description">This dissertation provides a descriptive-analytic study of the reasons and influences underlying Japan's less than progressive policy record on wildlife preservation, domestically and globally, since 1980. This research is important for a number of reasons, but mainly it helps us to test a number of theoretical models about: policy-making in Japan; Japanese environmental diplomacy; social movements; and corporatism. I hypothesise that apart from a common sense of purpose that binds the different policy actors together, Japan's poor record on wildlife preservation is a derivative of the way environmental NGOs have been marginalised and excluded from the policy process. This hypothesis links to Japan's public safety, and food and economic security concerns whereby these concerns tend to frame and guide policy-making on wildlife and nature issues. Using case study and participant observation methodologies to gather empirical evidence, this dissertation analyses both Japanese state behaviour towards global and domestic wildlife issues, and the changing relationships between the Japanese state, foreign pressure and environmental NGOs, in order to confirm or deny the hypothesis. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Ramsar Convention are the two environmental regimes which provide the context and issues for the analyses. The research concludes that there is convincing evidence to support the hypothesis. The research also reveals the positive, although subtle, sea changes which are occurring in Japanese environmental politics in the light of the continuing changes taking place in both Japan's broader political economy and in the international community.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental policy making</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">wildlife preservation</field><field name="subject">CITES</field><field name="subject">Ramsar Convention</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20051103.145726</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Third Turn as a Teachable Moment in Foreign Language Pedagogy</field><field name="creator">Dashwood, Ann</field><field name="description">Talk is the vehicle of exchange in language classrooms when communicative competence is being developed. Turns of talk then facilitate the meaning-making process as students and teachers collaboratively come to understand the discourse of knowledge they are co-constructing. During the pivotal third turn in the essential teaching exchange, there is potential for teachers to realise productive pedagogies as they facilitate their students' organisational and pragmatic skills in the foreign language. This study brings a lens to Initiation-Response-Evaluation (IRE) triadic dialogue, which has been criticised for its monological overuse and limitation of students' language production. Analysis of the third turn shows the uptake to be an implicit move in the exchange. Teachers appear not to be aware of the potential benefit it offers them for co-constructed language use at that point in teacher-student interactions. Teachers draw on students' background knowledge and experiential learning in the four domains of productive pedagogies (intellectual quality, supportive classroom environment, recognition of difference and connectedness) when they engage them through an authentic use of language. For this study, potential for productive pedagogy was investigated in the classroom talk of two teachers of Japanese at year 10 level. In a case study, six transcribed and translated lessons were subjected to conversational and membership categorisation analyses using Bachman's (1990) communicative language ability framework to describe language production around the third turn and to hypothesise its effectiveness in providing opportunities for students to generate output in the target language.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Initial-response-evaluation</field><field name="subject">foreign language pedagogy</field><field name="subject">classroom dialogue</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060810.092724</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquisition and Analysis of Aquatic Stroke Data From an Accelerometer Based System</field><field name="creator">Davey, Neil P.</field><field name="description">The aim of this work was to develop devices for elite athletes to record performance related parameters during their training. A device was initially designed and built for rowing to record the motion of the boat. This was to gain understanding of motion signals in a one dimensional plane. The device uses a iPAQ handheld computer for recording and display of data to the user. Using the knowledge obtained from the accelerometer data of the rowing system an initial prototype device was designed and constructed for use in swimming. This device was required to be wearable whilst the swimmer was training, thus it had to record the data onboard. A second version of the swimming device was constructed to improve the usability of the device. The swimming device has fully sealed electronics, wireless charging and infrared communications. The device records three dimensional acceleration patterns at 150Hz, and can store over 6 hours of data using the internal memory. The device can operate for greater than 12 hours before needing to be recharged. The data collected from the swimming device was used to develop processing algorithms to extract when the swimmers push off from the wall, the type of stroke they are swimming, and for freestyle the stroke count. The results of the wall push off algorithm were compared against manual hand timing with 90% algorithm results being with &#177;1 second of the hand timing data. The stroke type identification algorithm determines which stroke is being swum and presently has an accuracy of 95%. The results of the freestyle stroke count algorithm were compared against manual stroke counts from raw accelerometers data and underwater video. Of the 164 data sets analysed over 90% of the algorithm results were within &#177;1 strokes of the manual recorded stroke counts.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquatic stroke data</field><field name="subject">swimming device</field><field name="subject">accelerometer</field><field name="subject">acceleration patterns</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20061003.153043</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational climate and its influence upon performance: A study of Australian hotels in South East Queensland</field><field name="creator">Davidson, Michael Cameron Gordon</field><field name="description">This study gathered data from 14 four to five-star hotels in South-East Queensland, Australia, in an attempt to examine the nature and degree of influence organisational climate has upon the performance of hotels. Employee perception of customer satisfaction was studied both as an index of performance and as an intervening variable between organisational climate and financial performance as indexed by revenue per available room (REVPAR). The data provided a description of a young, relatively gender balanced, well educated and trained work force which received relatively low levels of financial remuneration and displayed very high levels of turnover. A new instrument was used to measure the dimensions of organisational climate across the hotels. This instrument represented a modification of that presented by Ryder and Southey (1990), which itself was a modification of the 145 item psychological climate questionnaire of Jones and James (1979). The instrument represented a subset of 70 items of the Ryder and Southey instrument. Responses to all items within the instrument were on a 7 point anchored scale. Principal components analysis (PCA) produced results consistent with earlier versions of the instrument, which had been reported elsewhere. This analysis described organisational climate within the sample to be composed of 7 underlying dimensions; Leader facilitation and support, Professional and organisational esprit, Conflict and ambiguity, Regulations, organisation and pressure, Job variety, challenge and autonomy, Workgroup co-operation, friendliness and warmth, and Job standards. These dimensions were judged to be consistent with those reported earlier by Jones and James, and by Ryder and Southey. Poor support was found for the first structural model that proposed that employee demographic variables would affect organisational climate and that organisational climate would affect customer satisfaction (although the latter link was quite strong). The most important finding of the study was the support for a second structural model when it was found that variation in the 7 dimensions of organisational climate accounted for 30% of the variation in Employee Perception of Customer Satisfaction. Furthermore, that Employee Perception of Customer Satisfaction accounted for 23% of the variation in REVPAR between the hotels. Possible extensions of this study using direct measures of customer satisfaction and expanding it to include hotels of different star ratings are discussed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational climate</field><field name="subject">hotels</field><field name="subject">hotel</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">southeast</field><field name="subject">south east Queensland</field><field name="subject">south east</field><field name="subject">hotel management</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030102.103647</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of Transformational Leadership by Personality Constructs for Senior Australian Organisational Executive Leaders</field><field name="creator">Davies, Malcolm Roy</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis was to investigate prediction of senior leader transformational leadership behaviour.  Transformational leadership was identified as a major theory with substantial practical implications for economic prosperity.  It was argued that a better understanding of what predicts transformational behaviour would assist in creating a lift in the effective application of the theory with attendant benefits for all organisational stakeholders. It was proposed that personality components would predict transformational behaviour.  Personality was conceptualised in two ways: as components of the Five Factor Model of personality and as personality disorder components.  Specifically, eight personality constructs were hypothesised as predictors.  They were three Hogan Personality Inventory based Five Factor Model components and the five Hogan Development Survey personality disorder components.  It was further proposed that self-subordinate rating agreement would moderate the prediction of transformational behaviour by the selected personality components.  A survey research methodology was used to gather data from senior Australian organisational executive leaders.  Two samples were accessed while subjects were attending training or strategy seminars.  The samples incorporated a total of 462 individual senior leader subjects and 1,881 of their subordinates drawn from the top four levels of a range of large multi-level public and private Australian organisations.  It was argued that the sample validly represent a senior executive cohort of organisational leaders.  Subject leaders completed a brief demographic questionnaire, the leader version of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, and either the Hogan Personality Inventory or the Hogan Development Survey.  Subjects' subordinates completed the rater version of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire.  Transformational behaviour was operationalised as charisma, which was calculated as the mean of two subordinate rated transformational components of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, viz., idealised behaviour and inspirational motivation.  This dependent variable was regressed on the various personality variables to assess predictive ability.  Moderation of the prediction of transformational leadership behaviour by personality components was assessed by multiple regression of transformational leadership behaviour on the various personality components within self-subordinate rating agreement categories. There were eight specific original contributions from the findings of this thesis.  The HPI component ambition was found to positively predict charisma. The HPI component prudence was found to negatively predict charisma.  Self subordinate rating agreement operationalised as an absolute difference score was found to moderate the level of prediction by whole HPI regression model and some of the relationships and predictions of charisma by individual HPI components.  It was found that prevalence of personality disorder components among senior executives varied from six percent to 34 percent of the sample cases.  The HDS personality disorder components sceptical and cautious were found to negatively predict charisma; whereas the HDS component imaginative was found to positively predict charisma.  Self subordinate rating agreement operationalised as a relative difference score was found to moderate the whole HDS regression model and some but not all of the relationships and predictions of charisma by individual HDS components.  Theoretical and practical implications of the above findings, limitations of this research and recommendations for future research were discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transformational leadership</field><field name="subject">executive leaders</field><field name="subject">personality components</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20060220.142914</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovation Through Action Research in Environmental Education: From Project to Praxis</field><field name="creator">Davis, Julie Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis is a work-in-progress that articulates my research journey based on the development of a curriculum innovation in environmental education. This journey had two distinct, but intertwined phases: action research based fieldwork, conducted collaboratively, to create a whole school approach to environmental education curriculum planning; and a phase of analysis and reflection based on the emerging findings, as I sought to create personal "living educational theory" about change and innovation.  A key stimulus for the study was the perceived theory-practice gap in environmental education, which is often presented in the literature as a criticism of teachers for failing to achieve the values and action objectives of critical environmental education. Hence, many programs and projects are considered to be superficial and inconsequential in terms of their ability to seriously address environmental issues. The intention of this study was to work with teachers in a project that would be an exemplar of critical environmental education. This would be in the form of a whole school "learnscaping" curriculum in a primary school whereby the schoolgrounds would be utilised for interdisciplinary critical environment education. Parallel with the three cycles of action research in this project, my research objectives were to identify and comment upon the factors that influence the generation of successful educational innovation.  It was anticipated that the project would be a collaboration involving me, as researcher-facilitator, and many of the teachers in the school as active participants. As the project proceeded through its action cycles, however, it became obvious that the goal of developing a critical environmental education curriculum, and the use of highly participatory processes, were unrealistic. Institutional and organisational rigidities in education generally, teachers' day-to-day work demands, and the constant juggle of work, family and other responsibilities for all participants acted as significant constraints. Consequently, it became apparent that the learnscaping curriculum would not be the hoped-for exemplar. Progress was slow and, at times, the project was in danger of stalling permanently. While the curriculum had some elements of critical environmental education, these were minor and not well spread throughout the school. Overall, the outcome seemed best described as a "small win"; perhaps just another example of the theory-practice gap that I had hoped this project would bridge.  Towards the project's end, however, my continuing reflection led to an exploration of chaos/complexity theory which gave new meaning to the concept of a "small win". According to this theory, change is not the product of linear processes applied methodically in purposeful and diligent ways, but emerges from serendipitous events that cannot be planned for, or forecast in advance. When this perspective of change is applied to human organisations - in this study, a busy school - the context for change is recognised not as a stable, predictable environment, but as a highly complex system where change happens all the time, cannot be controlled, and no one can be really sure where the impacts might lead. This so-called "butterfly effect" is a central idea of this theory where small changes or modifications are created - the effects of which are difficult to know, let alone determine - and which can have large-scale impacts.  Allied with this effect is the belief that long term developments in an organisation that takes complexity into account, emerge by spontaneous self-organising evolution, requiring political interaction and learning in groups, rather than systematic progress towards predetermined goals or "visions". Hence, because change itself and the contexts of change are recognised as complex, chaos/complexity theory suggests that change is more likely to be slow and evolutionary - cultural change - rather than fast and revolutionary where the old is quickly ushered out by radical reforms and replaced by new structures and processes. Slow, small-scale changes are "normal", from a complexity viewpoint, while rapid, wholesale change is both unlikely and unrealistic. Therefore, the frustratingly slow, small-scale, imperfect educational changes that teachers create - including environmental education initiatives - should be seen for what they really are. They should be recognised as successful changes, the impacts of which cannot be known, but which have the potential to magnify into large-scale changes into the future. Rather than being regarded as failures for not meeting critical education criteria, "small wins" should be cause for celebration and support.  The intertwined phases of collaborative action research and individual researcher reflection are mirrored in the thesis structure. The first three chapters, respectively, provide the thesis overview, the literature underpinning the study's central concern, and the research methodology. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 report on each of the three action research cycles of the study, namely Laying the Groundwork, Down to Work!, and The Never-ending Story. Each of these chapters presents a narrative of events, a literature review specific to developments in the cycle, and analysis and critique of the events, processes and outcomes of each cycle. Chapter 7 provides a synthesis of the whole of the study, outlining my interim propositions about facilitating curriculum change in schools through action research, and the implications of these for environmental education.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">fieldwork</field><field name="subject">field work</field><field name="subject">curriculum design</field><field name="subject">curriculum planning</field><field name="subject">curriculum innovation</field><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="subject">theory</field><field name="subject">practice</field><field name="subject">praxis</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20040618.110511</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical Investigations of Great Barrier Reef Ascidians - Natural Product and Synthetic Studies</field><field name="creator">Davis, Rohan Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the chemical investigations of several ascidian species collected from the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. The thesis is divided into two separate components, Part A focuses on the isolation and structure elucidation of 11 previously undescribed ascidian metabolites. All structures were assigned using a combination of spectroscopic and/or chemical methods. Part B relates to the isolation and chemical conversion of a natural product to a combinatorial template. The natural product template was subsequently used in the generation of a solution-phase combinatorial chemistry library. A further two combinatorial libraries were generated from a synthesised model compound that was related to the natural product template. Part A. Investigation of Aplidium longithorax collected from the Swains Reefs resulted in the isolation of two new para-substituted cyclofarnesylated quinone derived compounds, longithorones J (30) and K (31). The former compound had its absolute stereochemistry determined by the advanced Mosher method. From an Aplidium longithorax collected from Heron Island, two new cyclofarnesylated hydroquinone compounds, longithorols C (46) and D (47) and a novel macrocyclic chromenol, longithorol E (48) were isolated. Longithorol C (46) had its absolute stereochemistry determined by the advanced Mosher method. Chemical investigation of the deep-purple colonial ascidian, Didemnum chartaceum collected from Swains Reefs led to the isolation of five new lamellarin alkaloids, which included the 20-sulfated derivatives of lamellarins B (94), C (95) and L (96), the 8-sulfated derivative of lamellarin G (97) and the non-sulfated compound, lamellarin Z (98). The known lamellarins A (63), B (80), C (64), E (65), G (67), and L (71) plus the triacetate derivatives of lamellarin D (82) and N (83) were also isolated. An aberration in the integration of signals in the 1H NMR spectra of the 20-sulfated derivatives (94-96) led to NMR relaxation studies. T1 values were calculated for all protons in the sulfated lamellarins (94-97) and their corresponding non-sulfated derivatives (80, 64, 71, 67). The protons ortho to the sulfate group in compounds (94-97) had T1 values up to five times larger than the corresponding protons in their non-sulfated derivatives (80, 64, 71, 67). A specimen of Eudistoma anaematum collected from Heron Island was shown to contain a new b-carboline alkaloid, eudistomin V (130), in addition to the two known metabolites, eudistomin H (105) and I (106). Part B. The known natural products, 1,3-diphenethylurea (29), 1,3-dimethylxanthine (30), 1,3-dimethylisoguanine (31) and the salts of tambjamine C (16), E (18) and F (19) were isolated from the ascidian, Sigillina signifera collected in Blue Lagoon, Lizard Island. Base hydrolysis on mixtures of the salts of tambjamine C (16), E (18) and F (19) resulted in the production of 4-methoxy-2,2-bipyrrole-5-carbaldehyde (26). This natural product template (26) was used in the generation of an enamine combinatorial chemistry library (98, 103-111) using solution-phase parallel synthesis. The biaryl compound, 4-(2-thienyl)-1H-pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde (59) was successfully synthesised using Suzuki-Miyaura coupling conditions and subsequently used as a template in the generation of an amine (67, 77, 80-87) and imine (78, 92-95) combinatorial library using solution-phase parallel synthesis.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ascidian</field><field name="subject">ascidians</field><field name="subject">sea squirt</field><field name="subject">sea squirts</field><field name="subject">Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">natural product</field><field name="subject">synthetic studies</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20030102.104858</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc></add>
