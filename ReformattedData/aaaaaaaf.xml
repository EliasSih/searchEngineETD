publications presented here are concerned with the development of practice and knowledge in midwifery. The thesis underlying the publications is that the development of a positive personal relationship between women and their midwives is fundamental to effective and sensitive midwifery care. The methodology used is essentially different to the thesis written prospectively. This is because the publications presented arise from years of work informed by 'hands on' practice, development of policy, leading change and development, supported by research and communicated and disseminated through writing. The work presented therefore could be viewed as a long research project, with these activities forming an iterative process in thinking through and writing for publication, as well as continuing practice development and research. The extended essay serves to introduce the publications and show how they are linked through common themes developed over time. It also demonstrates the originality, importance and contribution of the publications. The publications presented may be viewed conceptually in a number of different ways however these are all related to the relationship between women and their midwives. The essay is presented in sections. The first is the Introduction to key concepts and theories. The second is The Midwife with Woman Relationship. This introduces publications that describe the nature and purpose of the relationship. The third section, Changing Practice: the New Midwifery is concerned with what the midwife does in the context of that relationship. Publications introduced in this section propose ways of working in the best interests of women and their families. The fourth section, Influencing Policy Nationally and internationally, is concerned with the creation of national policy that has supported the development of what I have called the New Midwifery. The fifth section, Transformative Change and Rediscovering Midwifery is concerned with developing the organisation and culture of care, that is its context, to enable midwives to work in the best interests of women and their families. The sixth section Developing Patterns of Practice that Enable Personal Relationships Between Women and Midwives: One-to-One Midwifery introduces publications concerned with the development and evaluation of new structures that facilitate continuity of care and thereby relationship.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery.</field><field name="subject">Social aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Qualities of Primary Art Teachers</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study aimed to determine the qualities of beliefs and practices apparent in a group of accomplished primary art teachers to ascertain if these may be used to inform and improve design and practice in preservice primary art teacher education programs within Australia. The participants in this study were twenty-two accomplished primary art teachers who possessed a recognised ability to successfully teach primary visual arts and who included specialist and generalist primary art teachers.  Teachers were designated 'specialists' if they taught art across the school.  If they taught across disciplines within the primary curriculum and taught a single class they were referred to as 'generalist teachers.'  Primary school is the place in which Australian children aged four and twelve years old receive their education.  The accomplished art teachers met for four group discussion sessions termed 'critical friends groups.  These were facilitated by the researcher who then visited schools to observe the teachers in practice. Informal, reflective discussions involving the participants followed.  The teachers' conversations were transcribed and interpreted using a critical appreciative framework that used themes to highlight qualities of practice and beliefs.  These were presented as a collaged narrative including the voices of the accomplished teachers and my reflections as critic.  The analogy of quilting represented the piecing together of teachers' conversations to form blocks and the analysis of these blocks in larger patterns of analysis. This research was underpinned by the belief that teaching is an art, and that accomplished teachers are artists.  Models of criticism were applied to emphasise appreciation of the art teachers and their teaching. Observations, interpretation and presentation were viewed through the eyes of a critic who values the sensitivity and intuition of the creative mind. The results of the study indicated the importance of visual experiences and art appreciation in the formation of accomplished art teachers. These teachers valued individuality, creativity and ownership in children's art and respected the children as artists and visual communicators.    They defined art as a process, grounded in the human need to communicate and contended that this process is teachable and that preservice art education needs to be enhanced to more adequately train future generalist art teachers. The research raised challenges to shift the focus in preservice art teacher education from linear models of instruction to a conception characteristic of risk-taking and flexibility.  A stronger emphasis needs to be given to the place of art appreciation and significant visual encounters within preservice art education.  Similarly, resource and studio management require greater prominence. The accomplished art teachers stressed the need to improve the profile of art education; the need for networks to overcome the isolation characteristic of primary art teachers; and greater training for generalist teachers rather than the wider introduction of specialist art teachers in primary schools.  The art-based methodology of critical appreciation encouraged the development of an ethical and critical research community that enabled significant data to become apparent. The use of collaged narrative yielded a meaningful quilt that may be metaphorically moved and placed in a number of preservice art education contexts.  The critical appreciative method revealed that research could be conducted within a strong aesthetic paradigm.  The research indicated that accomplished primary art teachers possess considerable knowledge, skills and expertise that can be incorporated into preservice art education.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary school teaching.</field><field name="subject">Art teachers.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variability in the Precision of Acupoint Location Methods</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The ability to precisely locate appropriate acupoints is, according to both traditional and contemporary theories, essential to deliver acupuncture treatments. More than half of the acupoints defined in acupuncture literature are sufficiently distant to anatomical landmarks, to require the use of specialised techniques in order to locate them. However no research has been conducted to investigate the precision of any manual method (electrical detection is discussed at detail with reference to numerous conflicting research papers).  This thesis details the design, conduct and results of experimentation carried out to measure the precision of four methods (named the directional, proportional, elastic and ruler methods) used to locate acupoints. The methods include two based upon the traditional Chinese anatomical unit of measurement, the cun, and two based upon the traditionally reported lengths of areas of the human body. The reasons for selecting these methods, and for excluding others, are explained.  Seventy two subjects were involved in testing the precision of the four methods by applying them when locating a fictitious acupoint. The subjects marked the attempts to locate the fictitious acupoint with invisible ink. The marks were transferred to plastic films and measurements made from reference points.  A significant difference was found between the methods (F3,120 = 11.74, p less than 0.0001). No significant difference was found between the two traditional methods of point location (directional mean = 11.35, and proportional mean = 11.17) (p less than 0.998), nor between the two variant methods of point location (elastic mean = 7.63, and ruler mean = 6.34) (p less than 0.68). Significant differences were found between the two traditional methods and the two variant methods. The directional method was less precise than both the elastic method (F3,120 = 11.74, p less than 0.007) and the ruler method (p less than 0.00009). The proportional method was also less precise than both the elastic method (F3,120 = 11.74, p less than 0.011) and the ruler method (p less than 0.0002).  Each subject also completed a short questionnaire regarding ease and comfort of use of the four methods. The two more precise methods were generally not well received by subjects in this study. Their two primary concerns were not with precision, but rather of application of the method, and its perceived appearance to patients.  An analysis was also carried out to describe any variation in acupoint location descriptions reported by prominent authors. 151 clinical research papers reporting acupuncture studies were selected according to a number of criteria. The five most frequently prescribed acupoints in these papers comprised the sample used in the examination of seven acupuncture texts. Variability was found between the texts, and is discussed in consideration of the presently poor understanding of the anatomical make-up of an acupoint.  Also examined was the usefulness of measures of sensitivity to palpation used when locating acupoints. No statistically significant difference was found between any of the acupoints tested and the related control points.  The thesis discusses the implications for acupuncture practice, research and education in light of the lack of precision measured, the subjects' preference for the more imprecise methods, the inability to locate or even verify the location of an acupoint using pressure, variability in reported acupoint locations between reference texts, and the related short-comings in published acupuncture research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acupuncture points.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of a program implemented to reduce surgical wound infection in an acute care hospital in India: A clinical practice improvement project</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This research project investigated the impact of an action research intervention implemented to reducing surgical wound infection in one of the acute care hospitals in India. The study aimed to develop and implement a clinical practice improvement program in reducing surgical wound infection by improving the hand washing and wound dressing practices of nurses. The study also aimed to identify the important contributing factors to a model that predicts surgical wound infection. Pre-post evaluation measures were taken to compare the results of surgical wound infection rate before and after the implementation of the intervention. Surgical wounds of two thousand patients (one thousand before the intervention and another one thousand after) were assessed to determine the wound infection rate and severity of wound infection. The hand washing and wound dressing practices of forty nurses were observed. These same nurses were involved in the intervention using a participatory action research process. The results of the study suggest that there was a marked, significant reduction in the rate and severity of wound infection following the implementation of the intervention. By increasing the hand washing facilities in the ward, educating nurses on the importance of better hygiene, pre-operative shaving and post-operative wound care, the hand washing and wound dressing practices of nurses improved considerably. These improvements resulted in a reduction in the number and severity of patients' surgical wound infections. The study also examined the contribution of different factors to surgical wound infection in a Indian hospital. Significant predictive factors were the patients' age, longer pre-operative hospital stay, extended pre-operative shaving time before surgery, wound class, and co-morbidity of the patient. The identification of risk factors that contributed to increased surgical wound infection for example pre-operative skin preparation, pre-operative hospital stay of the patient would help in taking appropriate measures at the ward level and organisation as a whole. Nosocomial infections extends to an unnecessary lengthy hospital stay, additional treatment increased mortality and morbidity, and increased cost to the patients and the nation as a whole. This project proved that educational mentoring, data surveillance processes and involving the nurses in an action research process were effective in enabling participants to improve their clinical practice and thereby reduce the incidence of patients' surgical wound infections. Establishing infection control teams, ongoing surveillance and feedback to staff of nosocomial infection rates is an urgent need in all Indian hospitals. Organisational management, as a priority, need to provide funding and staff dedicated to undertaking this essential work. Health care professionals can no longer plead ignorance of a situation for which all have a moral and professional responsibility.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hospitals.</field><field name="subject">India.</field><field name="subject">Clinical practice.</field><field name="subject">Surgical wound infections.</field><field name="subject">Nosocomial infections.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the Maximum Entropy Method to X-Ray Profile Analysis</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The analysis of broadened x-ray diffraction profiles provides a useful insight into the structural properties of materials, including crystallite size and inhomogenous strain. In this work a general method for analysing broadened x-ray diffraction profiles is developed. The proposed method consists of a two-fold maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach. Conventional deconvolution/inversion methods presently in common use are analysed and shown not to preserve the positivity of the specimen profile; these methods usually result in ill-conditioning of the solution profile. It is shown that the MaxEnt method preserves the positivity of the specimen profile and the underlying size and strain distributions, while determining the maximally noncommital solution. Moreover, the MaxEnt method incorporates any available a priori information and quantifies the uncertainties of the specimen profile and the size and strain distributions. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate that the MaxEnt method can be applied at two levels: firstly, to determine the specimen profile, and secondly to calculate the size or strain distribution, as well as their average values. The simulations include both sizeand strain-broadened specimen profiles. The experimental conditions under which the data is recorded are also simulated by introducing instrumental broadening, a background level and statistical noise to produce the observed profile. The integrity of the MaxEnt results is checked by comparing them with the traditional results and examining problems such as deconvolving in the presence of noisy data, using non-ideal instrument profiles, and the effects of truncation and background estimation in the observed profile. The MaxEnt analysis is also applied to alumina x-ray diffraction data. It is found that the problems of determining the specimen profile, column-length and strain distributions can be solved using the MaxEnt method, with superior results compared with traditional methods. Finally, the issues of defining the a priori information in each problem and correctly characterising the instrument profile are shown to be critically important in profile analysis.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entropy.</field><field name="subject">X-rays.</field><field name="subject">Diffraction.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Skillmax Program : An Evaluation</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The Skillmax Program was launched by the New South Wales State Government at the end of 1988 as a result of concern about the underutilisation of the skills of overseas qualified and experienced immigrants in the labour force. The program is administered by the NSW Adult Migrant English Service. The aim of this study is to evaluate how well the Skillmax Program is achieving its aim of assisting non-English speaking background immigrants to maximise the use of their overseas experience and skills within the NSW labour market. The main source of data for the evaluation was a questionnaire distributed to all students who had studied in the program from July, 1993 to June, 1994. Those in the final program intake surveyed had just completed courses, those in the first intake surveyed had completed courses nine months previously. The questionnaire was sent to 458 ex-students in August, 1994 and 217 questionnaires were returned. Additional data was obtained from a literature search, a survey distributed to Skillmax program staff and a focus group meeting of the Skillmax Program's teachers, educational and vocational counsellor and program manager. Key research findings are: 71.9% of all respondents had found employment since enrolling in the Skillmax Program and 67.7% were still employed when the study was conducted; 84.9% of those respondents who had completed or partially completed courses ending from six to nine months before the study was conducted had found employment and 78.5% were still employed when the study was conducted; 66.7% of those respondents in employment had found employment at the same occupational level as in their countries of birth; 52% of all respondents were either unemployed (28.1%) or underemployed (23.9%); 85.9% of those respondents in employment considered that the Skillmax Program had contributed significantly to their success in finding employment. The study compares the findings of the current study to those from a previous Skillmax Program evaluation concluded in 1992 (Mograby &amp; Eddie, The Skillmax Program Evaluation Report, 1992). Employment outcomes of participants in the current study are significantly better than those in the previous study. The study argues that improvements in employment outcomes can primarily be attributed to program improvements made since the 1992 evaluation. The study concludes that the Skillmax Program is achieving its aims. Recommendations for program improvement and future directions for the program are made.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language study and teaching.</field><field name="subject">Skilled labour.</field><field name="subject">Skillmax (Program : N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">Migrant labour.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of Virtual Collaboration</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Virtual collaboration-the act of working together across boundaries of space, time, and organization, aided by technology-has become increasingly commonplace in recent years. Doing so, however, presents a number of challenges to those involved. One of these is that because of a lack of experience in collaborating through computer-based collaboration systems, there is little knowledge on how to carry out collaboration virtually. Another is that it is not easy for those not directly involved in the collaboration to know what is, and has been, 'going on' during virtual collaboration. This thesis suggests that both of these challenges can be addressed with the same approach, namely by referring to observations of virtual collaboration. The problem then is how such observations of virtual collaboration can be obtained without requiring those involved in it to document their own actions. To address this problem is the objective of this thesis. The approach proposed here involves three elements: firstly, the collection of data about virtual collaboration; secondly, the modeling of this data; and thirdly, the derivation of increasingly abstract, larger-scale representations of virtual collaboration from this data. These representations are termed patterns of virtual collaboration, which are abstract descriptions of activities of virtual collaboration. A multi-layered conceptual model of information, the Information Pyramid of Virtual Collaboration, is proposed, providing different views of information related to virtual collaboration, at different levels of abstraction. The thesis then suggests how from a given body of data, patterns of virtual collaboration at a corresponding level of the Information Pyramid can be extracted, and how from collections of such patterns more abstract patterns of larger-scale activity can be derived, providing the observations of virtual collaboration sought. In considering how the extraction of patterns of virtual collaboration fits into the larger context of the conception, design, and use of collaboration systems, a Framework for Pattern Extraction and Feedback is proposed. This framework introduces the notion of collaboration memory, a type of organizational memory that contains records of collaborative activity. Moreover, the framework suggests how extracted patterns of virtual collaboration feed back into both ongoing development and use of collaboration systems. Finally, the modeling and extraction of patterns of virtual collaboration is illustrated in a case study involving the LIVENET collaboration system.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Virtual work teams.</field><field name="subject">Communication in organizations.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adult Education as Professional Practice</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The thesis will establish, through philosophical argument, particularly in philosophical psychology, that professional practitioners in adult education are those who see themselves (and indeed are also seen) as agents of the integration of (a) adults' learning from their experiences (the authenticity aspect), with (b) the values of 'education' (the integrity aspect). That is, such practitioners employ 'know how' to bring such integration about, and they may ideally exemplify a kind of wisdom in 'knowing why' they act as they do. We will call this the 'integrationist' model of adult education practice. This integrationist thesis, drawing mainly upon Wittgenstein, Kant and Aristotle: * takes the very phenomenon of the practices of adult educators as its starting point, rather than analyse concepts or language per se, and treats ethical and epistemological dimensions of this practice as interwined and equally central in such phenomena; * requires extensive treatment of the formation of the 'appropriateness' or efficacy of the ethical and epistemological ingredients of professional practice, and subsumes this 'know how' in the significance of sociocultural location; * assumes such people are still 'students' in the broad sense that they are integratively learning from their practical experience and that socio-culturally located workplaces provide the most significant context for their practice (intentionality and competence are especially addressed); * re-examines the emphasis in adult education on the role of experience and the self, and accordingly revitalises a constructivist approach more firmly based in ontological considerations; * accordingly, moves beyond an atomistic conception of professional competence and the sovereignty of the agency of the individual practitioner, * develops an emphasis on teleological considerations - adding 'knowing why' to a more holistic 'know how' and, in that sense, signals a retrieval of the notion of 'vocation', with an orientation towards the attainment of the 'rightness' of practical wisdom (phronesis) as the purpose of adult education as professional practice. Integrationism is thus also constructivist: professionals in any field are expected to make a positive difference. There are general features of the analysis pertinent to any practice where adults' circumstances are up for amelioration.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult education.</field><field name="subject">Educators.</field><field name="subject">Philosophy.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OJS in an Hour</field><field name="creator">OJS, Team</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between team characteristics with team performance in Malaysian teams.</field><field name="creator">Heng, Siok Sim Agatha</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.Faculty of Business.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teams.</field><field name="subject">Workplace.</field><field name="subject">Performance.</field><field name="subject">Malaysian.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coral bleaching: photosynthetic impacts on symbiotic dinoflagellates.</field><field name="creator">Hill, Ross</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

The exact nature and prevalence of these impacts and the processes that underlie their origins remain obscure in part because of the common assumption that measures and criteria developed with adult populations may be applied to youth. Therefore, the approach adopted in this doctoral sequence of empirical studies was to focus on the core addictive construct of self-control (Heather, Miller and Greeley, 1991) using in the first instance a qualitative data analysis of 34 youth who gambled regularly at least once per week. The main cognitive themes from the interviews were used to develop a Limit Maintenance Model which outlined five qualitatively different approaches to the control of gambling. With certain aims in mind, three empirical studies provided a mixed-methods approach to identifying the cognitive, emotional and developmental barriers to self-control of gambling. In so doing, they emphasized the imperative for youth to embark on a learning process to ensure their self-regulatory skills are sufficiently developed to manage the temptation to gamble to excess, and instead, maintain self-controlled and safe gambling behaviours.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gambling</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">addictions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Volatile compounds in some eastern Australian Banksia flowers</field><field name="creator">Tronson, Deidre A.</field><field name="description">This project was the very beginning of research into the chemistry of eastern Australian banksia flowers. Using dynamic headspace sampling (DHS) analysis, differences in volatile components, consistent with detection of differences in odour, were detected among three different species and one commercial cultivar. Infraspecific variation was also observed between two known subspecies of Banksia ericifolia and between differently coloured forms of Banksia spinulosa var. collina. The cultivar, Banksia 'Giant Candles', was shown to have some of the chemical components of each of its supposed ancestors. The absence of known wound-response chemicals indicated that this DHS method was successful in leaving the inflorescences undamaged throughout the sampling procedure. The Likens-Nickerson modification of classical hydrodistillation methods was useful. The static headspace method (SHS) was easily automated and was shown to be chemically robust and sufficiently sensitive to detect volatile compounds from only a few flowers. The milder DHS method, which minimised mechanical and heat damage to the plant tissue, produced a different set of results. From the results of this project, a suite of volatile compounds has been proposed that may be useful in future behavioural studies to help determine whether animals are attracted to components of banksia odours. These candidates include some compounds that have been reported in animal secretions, wound-response chemicals that may be produced by the plant to aid its communication with other organisms, and a compound (suggested to be sulfanylmethyl acetate) not previously reported from natural sources. The mildest of the three analytical methods used, dynamic headspace sampling, was shown to be suitable for the potential chemotaxonomic evaluation of some members of the Banksia genus.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eastern Banksia</field><field name="subject">dynamic headspace sampling (DHS)</field><field name="subject">volatile components</field><field name="subject">static headspace method (SHS)</field><field name="subject">odoriferous compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards ethical 'arts of existence' : through art therapy and narrative therapy</field><field name="creator">Linnell, Sheridan</field><field name="description">This thesis enacts a response, rather than provides an answer, to questions of &#8216;what we are&#8217; and &#8216;what we might become&#8217;, in the context of a poststructural enquiry into (my) practices of art psychotherapy and narrative therapy.

A grounded theory approach using a symbolic interactionist framework was adopted based on 27 in- depth semi structured interviews with adolescents and young adults with diabetes. Respondents described the effects of diabetes management on the physical, emotional, social and related selves. They also described their various illness self representations. It often took an inordinate amount of work for the respondents to manage their diabetes. This ?management? work could be related to problems with their physiological control, emotional stressors, the need to be socially interactive, differing priorities or relational issues. Certainly even the most resilient respondents experienced periods of vulnerability and needed to nurture the ?self?

The basic assumptions underpinning agricultural development in Nepal are that food security can be improved through the application of agricultural technologies and increasing production. The findings of this research question these assumptions.The study demonstrated that external changes which take place in the real world are connected to the internal changes which occur within the individuals and groups involved.An action research methodology was chosen to find alternative strategies to examine the current approaches to addressing the food security situation. The findings revealed three dimensions needing to be addressed to deal with food security at the farming household level. The fact that a collaborative partnership must be established between all the stakeholders involved in order to bring about improvements in the situation was revealed.This called for the conversion of 'experts' into 'co-partners' in the learning process. The learning journey showed that it is possible to initiate change, and the changes achieved indicate a huge potential for researchers and those interested in food security to make a real and lasting difference</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">food supply</field><field name="subject">rural development</field><field name="subject">agricultural productivity</field><field name="subject">hunger</field><field name="subject">Nepal</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of elevated CO2 partial pressure on early growth and development of rice</field><field name="creator">Aben, Silvestre K.</field><field name="description">The rise in atmospheric CO2 partial pressures that is predicted for the 21st Century is likely to increase productivity and alter nutrient of C3 crop plants. Consequently, physiological data on plant growth and nutrition at elevated CO2 are required, because these data underpin simulation models, which are needed for management of crops under the CO2 scenario for the mid to late 21st Century.In particular, information is required about management of nitrogen(N) fertilisation because this mineral nutrient plays a central role in the growh of many crops. Rice was chosen as a model plant because of its widespread consumption throughout the world and its responsiveness to CO2 and N fertilisation. There were three major hypotheses: first, that early exposure of rice plants to high CO2 is required to achieve the maximum growth and tillering response; secondly, that early increases in growth and tillering at high CO2 are associated with the phytohormone, ethylene; and thirdly, that growth at elevated CO2 decreases leaf N concentrations required to support maximum dry mass production and photosynthetic rates (critical concentrations).Several tests and experiments were conducted and results noted. It is likely that grain yield will be greater as the atmospheric CO2 partial pressure rises even when N supplies are low, providing that high CO2 does not cause accelerated tiller abortion at low N.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">greenhouse gases</field><field name="subject">carbon dioxide</field><field name="subject">rice growing</field><field name="subject">climatic factors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Achieving risk congruence in a banking firm</field><field name="creator">Ford, Guy, 1961-</field><field name="description">One of the reasons for firms decentralising aspects of their operations is to enable managers to gain specialised knowledge of local conditions. For credit managers in a banking firm, this may take the form of knowledge of investment opportunities and the risk profiles of each of these opportunities. In light of principal-agent problems that arise when information is asymmetrical, the focal point of this dissertation is the development of incentive-compatible mechanisms that facilitate the free and accurate disclosure of the private information of managers on the risk profile of investments to the centre of the bank at the time investment decisions are being implemented. These mechanisms are required because managers may have strong incentives to misrepresent their private information when doing so has the potential to favourably impact on the size of their remuneration. This, in turn, has a direct impact on the ability of the centre to optimally allocate the capital of the bank and effectively price risk into bank investments. The dissertation commences by examining which internal risk measures act to align the investment decisions of managers in a bank with the risk/return goals of the centre of the bank. This requires knowledge of the bank risk preference function. It is initially assumed that managers have developed specialised knowledge of the opportunity set of available investments, and have no reason to misrepresent this information to the centre. This assumption is later removed and the implications assessed. In order to ensure incentive-compatibility between the centre and managers, a truth-revealing mechanism is employed in the capital allocation process and tied to the compensation payment function of the bank. This mechanism acts to ensure managers disclose their private information on the expected risks and returns in the investments under their control, and facilitates the efficient investment of capital within the bank.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">financial institutions</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">banks and banking</field><field name="subject">moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/12022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cross-cultural appropriation of manga and anime in Australia</field><field name="creator">Norris, Craig Jeffrey</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into the cross-cultural appropriation of manga and anime by fans in Australia. I investigate the way in which fans embark on &#8216;identity&#8217; projects through manga and anime to construct a space where issues of gender politics, identity and culture are explored. I argue that a key reason why many Western fans and scholars perceive manga and anime as &#8216;different&#8217; is its &#8216;Japaneseness&#8217;. The two key problems addressed throughout the thesis are : how can we analyse the significance of the Japanese origins and context of manga and anime, and would the &#8216;identity projects&#8217; that fans construct be possible without an appreciation of manga and anime&#8217;s 'Japaneseness?.' These questions are explored in terms of a number of key forms within manga and anime including cyberpunk, bishonen(beautiful boys), otaku(fans) and anime forms that have had their &#8216;Japaneseness&#8217; softened. I discuss the way in which these manga and anime forms offer different spaces for fans, scholars and cultural industries to contest, rework and reiterate the cultural value of manga and anime.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">cultural diffusion</field><field name="subject">21st century</field><field name="subject">Japanese influence on Australian culture</field><field name="subject">popular culture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/13320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HSC Aboriginal studies : strengths, limitations, and impact upon Aboriginal students' self-concepts and educational outcomes</field><field name="creator">Wray, Debra E.</field><field name="description">Two primary, interdependent goals of the NSW Higher School Certificate Aboriginal Studies course are enhancing Indigenous students&#8217; self-concepts and educational outcome. It was considered that these would lead to increased Indigenous student participation and retention to Year 12. Yet recently there has been a decline in enrolments. Despite the introduction of Aboriginal Studies over a decade ago, no rigorous research has been undertaken to determine the impact of the course or the extent to which the aims of the course have been achieved. Research in Aboriginal Education has identified that Indigenous students are still not achieving at the same level as their non-Indigenous counterparts. However, the majority of studies to date have been theoretical and descriptive in nature. The primary purpose of the present investigation was to address some of the above issues by elucidating the (a) factors that influence Indigenous students&#8217; decisions to participate in the HSC Aboriginal Studies course; (b) impact of the course on Indigenous students&#8217; self-concepts and educational outcomes; and (c) strengths and limitations of the course. The research was undertaken in three NSW Department of Education and Training secondary schools, located in rural, north coast, and south coast areas. Results indicated that Indigenous students choose Aboriginal Studies based on their need to understand more about their own culture. There were also clear educational benefits in that Aboriginal Studies was considered to be a motivational factor that encouraged attendance at school and enhanced their academic self concept. Both staff and students suggested that the academic rigour of the Aboriginal Studies course contributed to declining enrolments. Overall the findings suggest that whilst the current course has some limitations, there are also many strengths; this implies there is a need to continue to refine the course to meet the needs of Indigenous students.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">indigenous students</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">educational leadership</field><field name="subject">self-concepts</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inter-occupational innovation : an exploration of commercial and research occupational subcultures within hybrid industry-research organisations</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Kathryn J.</field><field name="description">This study explores perceptions regarding the existence and influence of occupational subcultures on commercialisation outcomes in four Australian hybrid industry-research organisations. The thesis proposition is that occupational subcultures exist within Australian Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) and impact commercialisation outcomes; the distinctly different knowledge and skills that provide reason for research and commercial groups to collaborate, may simultaneously create obstacles to communication and cooperation. Understanding and considering the impact of occupational cultures that underpin the actions and decisions taken by member organisations and individuals, may be important in hybrid industry-research organisations. The findings of this study extend and challenge some of the management practices recommended by extant innovation research. In particular, the finding that process management techniques functioned to ease the transition from exploration to exploitation activities during commercialisation in one CRC contradicts advice to isolate exploration activities from process management. Directions for future research include the investigation of temporal orientations in research and commercial occupational subcultures in the context of commercialisation in hybrid-industry research organisations. Temporal attributes encompass planning horizons, mono and polychronicity, and attributes towards pace and punctuality. Additionally, the findings regarding the impact of argumentation styles upon commercialisation justify further research to examine different national settings, industry sectors and occupational communities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">research and development partnership</field><field name="subject">diffusion innovations</field><field name="subject">business innovations</field><field name="subject">industrial research</field><field name="subject">business enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The &#8216;Lazarus experience&#8217; : people with HIV making sense of their lives in the post-treatment era</field><field name="creator">Wong, Wai-Kwan Tim</field><field name="description">The medico-scientific advances made in the treatment of HIV and AIDS, which emerged in the mid 1990s, were significant. The Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatments (HAART) or anti- HIV treatments have been positioned as resources that changed the way HIV is now medically and socially constructed. Although HIV remains incurable, it is now constructed as a chronic disease that is treatable, manageable and people are no longer positioned as living with a &#8216;death sentence&#8217;. The research on which this thesis is based explores the subjective lived experiences of people with HIV living in urban Australia in the context of this change. The effects that the treatments have had on corporeality have also changed the ways people are now living with HIV in the post-treatment era. It is an era in which treatments for HIV are taken-for-granted, but issues, doubts and concerns relating to treatment use are firmly embedded in the everyday life of people with HIV. The findings suggest that whilst AIDS-related mortality has decreased since the availability of effective treatments, the notion of &#8216;quality of life&#8217;, as subjectively constituted and defined, is an ongoing negotiation that is predicated on people locating meaningfulness in their everyday lives. Despite the decreased threat of failing health and death, the findings also suggest that people are continuing to be confronted by, and therefore positioned as, having to make sense of complex issues embedded in living with a disease for which there is no cure.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV treatment</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) treatment</field><field name="subject">HIV positive persons</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">anti-HIV treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A literature of modern suffering : suffering in the work of Feodor Dostoevsky, Albert Camus and Milan Kundera</field><field name="creator">Powell, Elisabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the treatment of the theme of suffering by three modern authors: Feodor Dostoevsky, Albert Camus, and Milan Kundera. The analysis proceeds through the identification and examination of three primary concepts which I will argue are at the heart of their work, and which provide the conceptual foundations for their depictions of suffering: the wretched, the absurd, and the banal. These concepts will be used as an avenue through which to explore and articulate their treatment of suffering. It will be argued further that the work of these three authors forms a conceptual series, in that each contributes in an important way to the evolution of a modern secular way of thinking about suffering by producing portraits of suffering informed by concepts appropriate to specific moments in the modern era. The sense of wretchedness which emerges from Dostoevsky&#8217;s work is inextricably linked with the late nineteenth-century crisis-of-faith. The concept of the absurd ties Camus to the early-twentieth-century existentialist tradition, while the sense of banality in Kundera&#8217;s novels locates him in an era which has witnessed both the horrors of World War Two and the decline in the humanist tradition. The factor that unites them and gives order to their differences, however, is a common concern with questions of meaning. The loss of meaning in the modern era, and in particular the loss of meaning in relation to suffering, is a thread which develops progressively throughout the series. It is, as will be argued at the outset, what binds these three disparate authors together and what gives their work and their treatment of suffering a particular modern character.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dostoevsky, Feodor</field><field name="subject">Camus, Albert</field><field name="subject">Kundera, Milan</field><field name="subject">suffering in literature</field><field name="subject">novelists</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">history and criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multinuclear DNA binding ruthenium complexes</field><field name="creator">Brodie, Craig R.</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the synthesis, characterisation and DNA binding of a number of novel ruthenium(II) complexes. Four mononuclear complexes were synthesised. These complexes were resolved using a large scale extraction procedure employing the chiral TRISPHAT anion. The racemic mononuclear complexes containing halogenated ligands were used in the synthesis of the racemic dinuclear complexes. Resolved mononuclear complexes were also used to stereo-selectively synthesise enantiomers of their respective dinuclear complexes. All metal complexes were characterised using fluorescence spectroscopy. Resolved metal complexes were further characterised using CD spectroscopy to determine their molar rotation coefficients and optical purity. Preliminary DNA binding studies were conducted using the racemic dinuclear complexes and their mononuclear equivalent. Titration experiments with calf thymus-DNA were used to determine the DNA binding constant and binding site size. Samples containing a higher NaCl concentration (100 mM) slightly improved the oligonucleotide spectrum resolution, but not to an extent where a complex binding model could be determined. Attempts to determine DNA binding preferences of the dinuclear complexes with oligonucleotides which contain two-adenine bulge sites using a 96-well a fluorescence plate reader were attempted, but were unsuccessful.

It presents the beginnings of a genealogical analysis of &#8216;restorative justice&#8217; as it applies to criminal justice contexts. It comprises a &#8216;backwards-looking&#8217; component, in which accepted historical accounts of &#8216;restorative justice&#8217; are problematised, and a &#8216;forwards-looking&#8217; component, in which a partial history of discourse of &#8216;restorative justice&#8217; is presented. I conclude that these silenced discourses might be read as an incomplete and partial history of discourse of &#8216;restorative justice&#8217;. That is, &#8216;restorative justice&#8217; &#8216;makes sense&#8217; as an approach to criminal justice partly because of the credence of these discourses, upon which it relies, to some extent, for discursive legitimacy. These diverse and divergent discourses cast the &#8216;restorative justice&#8217; project not as the unified and stable &#8216;movement&#8217; as which it is usually portrayed, but as a fragmented and shifting phenomenon, comprised of a loose and heterogeneous assemblage of practices with variegated historical antecedents. Additionally, I conclude that some concerns raised by various scholars in the field &#8211; particularly in relation to the potential of &#8216;restorative practices&#8217; to impact negatively on already marginalised and disadvantaged populations &#8211; are validated by this genealogy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">restorative justice</field><field name="subject">criminals</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">correction philosophy</field><field name="subject">victims of crimes</field><field name="subject">criminal justice, administration of</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/17010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probiotic characteristics of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei and their effects on immune response and gene expression in mice</field><field name="creator">Paturi, Gunaranjan</field><field name="description">Probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are normal inhabitants of healthy gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which may promote beneficial effects on host through limiting the growth of undesirable micro-organisms and modulating the immune system. In the present study, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains were screened for their in vitro acid and bile tolerance, autoaggregation, coaggregation and hydrophobic abilities to identify potential probiotic bacteria. Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10 and Lactobacillus paracasei LAFTI L26 were selected based on their overall tolerance to in vitro acidic conditions to further investigate their influence on various immune functions and gene expression in mice. Immunofluorescent analysis of small intestine in mice fed with L. acidophilus or L. paracasei demonstrated an increase of immunoglobulin (Ig)-A, interleukin (IL)-10 and interferon (IFN)- producing cells compared to control mice. In summary, L. acidophilus and L. paracasei showed tolerance to various gastric conditions and bile salts. Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. paracasei enhanced gut and systemic immune functions, particularly non-specific and specific immune responses in normal and CT mice. Moreover, L. acidophilus regulated the genes involved in various biological functions in small bowel of normal and CT mice, which provided a basis in understanding the pathways through which these bacteria are beneficial to the host.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">probiotics</field><field name="subject">microorganisms</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal system</field><field name="subject">health aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/17783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laser plasma interaction for application to fusion energy</field><field name="creator">Evans, Peter J.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an investigation into inertial confinement fusion through mathematical models and computer simulations.

Models are developed that best suit plasma behaviour. The parameters are presented graphically against time and distance into a small plasma fuel pellet. It is noted how field density and ions form undulations through the plasma. Types of plasma fuels are discussed with regards to their key parameters. Computations are performed using the laser driven inertial energy option based on volume ignition with the natural adiabatic self-similarity compression and expansion hydrodynamics.

These objectives were explored in two sub-catchments within the Liverpool Plains, namely Big Jacks Creek and the Blackville.Soils are predominantly vertosols that crack deeply on drying, resulting in initially high infiltration rates on wetting and high water holding capacity. Field monitoring revealed that biofilters such as grassed waterways, natural grasslands or vegetated filter strips (VFS) positioned at multiple catchment scales can significantly reduce pollutant concentrations in runoff. The use of biofilters is discussed, along with other best management practices that will be needed to manage pesticide loads both at source and in the transport pathway.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">atrazine</field><field name="subject">herbicides</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">agricultural waste</field><field name="subject">groundwater pollution</field><field name="subject">water quality management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/22967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A radio survey of selected fields from the ROSAT All Sky Survey</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Martin William Bruce, 1965-</field><field name="description">The beginning of X-ray astronomy is based on two accidental discoveries made in 1962. A single point source, Scorpio X-1 and remarkable discovery of the diffuse background radiation, three years before the microwave background was discovered. Over the past four decades, X-ray astronomy has matured into a major branch of astronomy, contributing to our understanding of the physical processes operating in many different types of sources, from stars to high redshift quasars. In 1990, the launch of the ROSAT satellite offered to unique opportunity to investigate the radio properties of X-ray emitters. A sample of faint X-ray emitters from a deep pointed observation is used in this thesis to investigate the prediction that sub-mJy radio source are a major contributor to the X-ray background. Another sample of 695 bright X-ray emitters were selected from ROSAT All Sky Survey for optical follow-up as a European Southern Observatory key project. The radio follow-up of the sample was undertaken for this thesis. The aim is to construct a catalogue of radio emitting X-ray (REX) sources to study their quantitative statistical properties and to select out a sample of BL-Lac objects for further study. Based on previous surveys approximately 19% or 130 of the X-ray sources should be directly associated with a radio emitter, of which 90% will be positionally coincident with the most plausible optical candidate for an X-ray source.

Predictions at the time of the research indicated a need for different instructional roles and educational settings within university undergarduate curricula. The ideas for a New University in the USA and a need for improved agriculture curricula in Australia were compatible with the approach of the Hawkesbury experiential agriculture curricula developed in 1978. The research demonstrated the key competency development aspects of the original experiential curriculum could be maintained in the 1995 university curriculum, within fragmented subjects. There was some evidence the curriculum outcomes were narrower in terms of career awareness. Personality type influenced student perceptions of the difficulty and value of the experiential components of their curriculum. The correlation between experiential curricula and personality type suggets that new curricula content should include the concept of personality and also should be used in designing curricula. New courses in Human Resource Development in Rural Communities were suggested. Other opportunities for using experiential curricula including personality typology were University of Western Sydney majors, summer schools for international students and in-service training courses for governemnt organisations and private enterprises.

They take liberties with its form, content and configuration; they include subjects that might be considered insignificant, risqu&#233;, abstract or obscure. Their print run is too limited for ordinary publishing and marketing procedures. This thesis engages with the artists&#8217; book in terms of its various moods as suggested by the bodily humours of Hippocrates and Galen. It argues that humour (in its embodied sense) takes many forms in the artists&#8217; book: from the angry, the despairing or the melancholic to the comic or the joyful. In building a foundation for this approach to the artists&#8217; book the thesis also connects with crucial moments in the evolution of twentieth century conceptual thought about art. Chapter One introduces the idea of humour as a strategy used by book artists to negotiate an art world in which the aesthetic canon is under scrutiny. Up to this point a characteristic feature of this negotiation has been a search for a consistent definition of artists&#8217; book. My concerns are not so much with a fetishization of the book in a digitally challenging age, but, rather with the focus on the artists&#8217; book&#8217;s ironic techniques that are employed to oversee the nature of the form relative to changes in its context, both technological and cultural. In the second chapter, I connect the artists&#8217; book to some of its experimental origins within the literature of humour. I discuss a number of artists&#8217; books that exemplify the sharpness of wit, the use of irony, the depth of melancholy and the place of nonsense among other forms within the spectrum of humorous possibility. The &#8220;anatomy&#8221; of humour is dissected in the third chapter, according to the way in which it embodies the creative process. The concepts of appropriation and d&#233;tournement are basic tools, for the collection of subject matter. Every one of the books discussed use &#8220;wit&#8221; to carve a direct channel to the core of the idea it expresses. The diverse manifestations of irony enable the artists&#8217; book in its various guises to mislead, riddle, surprise and seduce its reader. &#8220;Nonsense&#8221; keeps rationality honest by arguing a case for a productive form of &#8220;uselessness&#8221; that reflects upon an art world burdened by the weight of &#8220;usefulness&#8221; and overproduction. The fourth chapter examines a number of artists&#8217; books and writers who, in various ways tap the rich field of the mundane: here is a source that like a compost heap, nurtures and produces those species of humorous surprise that also rejuvenate. The fifth chapter looks at larger aspects of the world, which shape our consciousness through spectacular images and the media. How these pressures permeate and influence the creative activities of the book artist is mapped in Chapter Six, which examines the shared internal space of the reader and the creator of the artwork. This internal space is the workshop of the book artist. Here the tactics are honed and the dynamics of the exterior world are in effect moulded and shaped into the subject matter and forms of artists&#8217; books. In a culture in which &#8220;success&#8221; is commensurate with the accumulation of wealth, to be unsuccessful is to belong to an under-class, to be invisible. Chapter Seven makes use of an ironic sense of failure as a strategy to support the main objective of the thesis, which is to test the limits for the possibility of an art practice that continues to thrive as it ducks and weaves its way through and under the radar of contemporary cultural conditions. It argues a case for a fugitive practice that even as it is on the move is congruent, and in its selfreflexivity, accountable for its political and aesthetic stance. There has been a considerable resurgence of interest in the artists&#8217; book since the late twentieth century with an increase in small press publications, the development of significant public and private collections of artists&#8217; books and a growing body of critical commentary on them. Digital technology and desk top publishing have enabled many artists to produce books rapidly, cheaply and with qualities ranging in quality from the photocopy through to slick high-end productions. From the 1970s until the present, however, the commentary on artists&#8217; books has been preoccupied with a search for a definition of the genre. Underpinning this endeavour has been a yearning for &#8220;consecration&#8221; (in Pierre Bourdieu&#8217;s sense) where acceptance would elevate the artists&#8217; book to the same level as the &#8220;legitimate&#8221; art forms &#8211; painting, sculpture, photography and the finely crafted art object. By contrast, this thesis considers the artists&#8217; book as an alternative art form and explores its ability to evade the constraints of consecration, to remain fresh and mischievous in creative and subversive ways</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">artists' books</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">themes, motives</field><field name="subject">illustration of books</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/25097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementing global and geographical education</field><field name="creator">Bliss, Sue, 1944-</field><field name="description">This portfolio documents the development and application of a new conceptual framework for the effective implementation of Global Education knowledge, perspectives, values and citizenship in the New South Wales Geography curricula for Years 7-8 (Stage 4), Years 9-10 (Stage 5), and Years 11-12 (Stage 6) (Board of Studies, 1998; 1999; 2003), related teaching and learning resources, and pre-service and in-service courses for teachers.

This work begins by describing the nature of information technology projects from an engineering perspective, particularly in light of the problems that may occur. The existing legal doctrines that are relevant to such projects are then described and expanded into the concept of a micro-agreement. The concept of micro-agreement is supported through the analysis of a number of csae studies relevant to the information technology industry, together with further analysis of legal relationship models. A number of key recommendations are made which provide support for gaining maximum benefits from micro-agreements. These recommendations include: linking information technology contracts to software engineering best practice; using an appropriate legal relationship model; and developing an industry wide Information Technology Code of Conduct.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">law and legislation</field><field name="subject">engineering</field><field name="subject">software</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/25573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mentoring, reflection and learning portfolios : an investigation into practices that contribute to professional learning</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Maggie</field><field name="description">This portfolio provides evidence of sustained activity, research and publications related to the broad area of professional learning. This research examined the construct of professional learning and the ways in which a number of factors can contribute to and assist this learning. The fundamental purpose of this body of work was to challenge current understandings of factors that contribute to professional learning and this research specifically argues that professional learning can be contributed to by a number of factors. The overall research focus for the studies was to explore the nature of the interrelationship between the factors of mentoring, reflection and portfolio development as key aspects of professional learning. Investigation into the practices of mentoring, reflection and portfolio development which underpinned the whole of this research led to the evolution of a conceptual framework. This framework captured the essence of professional learning and the processes that could assist beginning teachers in their learning. The research was set in authentic settings including the Bachelor of Education Primary Program at the University of Western Sydney, Nepean, the New South Wales Department of Education School Leadership Preparation Program and primary schools in Western Sydney. A number of data collection methods were utilised in the studies including document analysis, semi-structured interviews, focus questions, focus group meetings, self reflection and reflective writing and narratives. This research breaks ground by providing a conceptual framework that shows not only the relationship within and between the investigated practices but also the imperative interrelatedness of these practices in developing a sound and resonant professional learning process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">training of</field><field name="subject">mentoring in education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/26631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantification of trace metals in an adsorbent using proton induced x-ray emission</field><field name="creator">Yadav, Nirbhay N.</field><field name="description">High-energy ion beam based proton induced x-ray (PIXE) is an ideal analytical tool suitable for simultaneous quantification of trace elements with high accuracy.

That is, combinations of proper verbs with adverbial and/or prepositional particle(s), which are commonly known as: phrasal verbs. In addition, the thesis attempts to approve the fact that there are fundamental similarities and dissimilarities between English and Arabic phrasal verbs. Such similarities and dissimilarities are investigated at length through a theoretical comparison of these combinations in both languages. The main hypothesis of the study is that there are wide ranges of difficulties posed to Arabic professional translators and Arabic translation students when translating idiomatic English phrasal verbs into Arabic. Exploring such difficulties is the principle aim of the study. The other aim is to propose a number of recommendations for professional translators, lexicographers and pedagogues. Such recommendations are based on a range of findings arrived at from the empirical research carried out in the study. A linguistic contrastive analysis model for the analysis and translation of idiomatic English phrasal verbs into Arabic is devised in order to establish a yardstick by which the translation quality of such idiomatic expressions can be analysed, compared, evaluated and assessed. Translation tests are conducted to identify types of errors and translational pitfalls made by Arabic professional translators and Arabic translation students when handling the most problematic and challenging idiomatic English phrasal verbs. The results revealed that there are in fact lots of difficulties encountered by Arabic professional translators and Arabic translation students when dealing with the phenomenon of idiomatic English phrasal verbs. The most important aspect of such difficulties is the failure to achieve functional-pragmatic equivalents of such verbs. Overtly erroneous errors such as: literal translation, mistranslating, reducing idioms to sense and breaching of the Arabic language system, along with covertly erroneous errors, such as wrong Arabic collocation, shift of register, incorrect delivery of speech acts, usage of paraphrasing and usage of Arabic colloquial and regional dialects, were the major reasons behind the failure of delivering the appropriate functional pragmatic equivalents of the idiomatic English phrasal verbs listed in the translation tests.ABSTRACT</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Arabic language</field><field name="subject">translating into Arabic</field><field name="subject">translating into English</field><field name="subject">translating and interpreting</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/26979</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Nexial-topology' situation modelling : health ecology and other general perspectives</field><field name="creator">Bouchon, Marika</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT: This research generated a formal method for global &#8216;situation modelling&#8217; of near-critical and critical phenomena. The new paradigms and the construction of mental reality or social spaces do not explain the damaged world we leave to our children and the degeneration of health. The &#8216;physical&#8217; was explored experimentally through the reputed imperfection of the body in daily living and the ecology of its health. An &#8216;integral&#8217; methodology allowed combining this with a study of general perspectives in many fields. This theoretical and empirical study was framed according to a third-order logic: (1) The variety and inconsistency of perspectives on the unclear notion of &#8216;health&#8217; required a generalist (meta-)classification or organising principle applicable in particular to health. The method of &#8216;perspectival analysis&#8217; is based on the field- and domain-specific vocabularies, number of categories, and image types used in formulating explanation/ experience in each framework, in both scientific and human domains. This theoretical study was (2) grounded in a &#8216;radical empirical&#8217; study of the effects of nutrition and healing techniques on a low-grade chronic syndrome (not life threatening but connected to stress, inflammation, swelling, tissues wasting). A &#8216;local-case&#8217; experimental research design (representative of an aspect of health), and new topographic &#8216;gauging&#8217; techniques were devised to observe small spatial changes (positioning, distortion, distribution). The results and concrete/ practice models led to the same conclusion as the abstract study: all our perspectives on health, body and space, have some underlying systemic form, and have in common two unifying frames &#8211; duality and polarisation &#8211;, characteristic also of point-set theory derived frameworks. Using them allows &#8216;circumnavigating&#8217; the essential of all possible perspectives, without becoming lost in their details. However, they leave non-local effects, anomalies (or &#8217;bad behaviour&#8217;) and periodical instability unexplained. (3) These were investigated by studying behaviour (irrespective of whether internal or external), and &#8216;not well understood&#8217; induced health manifestations, and by mapping their topologic properties of small deformation through (a) a &#8216;local&#8217; cognitive consideration of experience construction, the research process itself, and the intellectual skill of model-making, (b) etymologic studies to track forward semantic developments and perspectival shifts and inversions, (c) a graphic study of the universal symbolic forms in models, traditions, and dreams, tracing them back to &#8216;world-origin&#8217; models (appearance/occurrence), and shape-icons (mental, cultural), such as tree, ladder, mountain or vortex-vertex spiral. This thesis examines health disturbance, physical distortions and cultural deformations, their usual descriptions as timed changes, and shows how two fundamental parameters of direction and motion (or movement, energy, 'Wind') define geometries of binding, or directional activation (or active projection). These culturo-mental geometries produce generic images of locally induced phenomena, and represent boundary phenomena globally as 'natural' in the spatial-physical world, and as 'hidden' or latent in the human world. Their downside is to introduce systematic instability in our expressions, models of culture/civilisation, as well as in health manifestations. All these are found to be rooted in modelling styles derived from the 'local' geometry of observing &#8211; framing &#8211; a field in 'perspective', mostly based on vision, audition, and skin surface (touch). These geo-Metries are used to explain and justify in particular the instability and recurrent crises of health in chronic syndromes and ageing, and the &#8216;badly behaved&#8217; health of childhood and adult females (eg consequences of pregnancy). The conclusion imposed itself that the &#8216;physical world of humans&#8217; is shaped through critical response and boundaries, and it appears that physical integrity, including sound health, sanity and even safety, cannot be preserved but by conscious alert attention or voluntary practice or effort (eg &#8216;workout&#8217;). Some experiences recounted in this work (some from the literature) led to an opposite presupposition. Three possible logics rule deployments of perspective into flat, spherical, and hyperbolic geometries (a known basis of mathematics). Which is used depends on the &#8216;local&#8217; state of criticality (sense of urgency, emergency, pressure) of the observing body-brain-&#8216;system&#8217;. It correlates with this universally assumed vertical axis, with the exclusive use [instruments too] of the senses of the head and of &#8216;skin-encapsulated&#8217; derived systemic definitions of &#8216;the world&#8217; and &#8216;the observer&#8217; (self or body). These allow localising and attributing properties to one or the other or their combination. However, they can also be considered as undifferentiated properties, &#8216;non-local&#8217; but governing, of the &#8216;physical world of humans&#8217; as it is apprehended in daily living, manifesting in a surface-related sense of swelling and gravity. A simple form of geometric topology &#8216;without hole&#8217; (without discontinuity), here introduced through two cognitive experiments, animations, and images, can describe this. The method of &#8216;nexial-topology&#8217; produces an &#8216;animated imaging&#8217; that can be used to model (but not &#8216;represent&#8217; in word, number, or realistic/ naturalistic images) the situation reaching &#8216;critical boundary&#8217;. It then shows auto-reinforcing self-organisation and auto-destruction in &#8216;passing&#8217; it. Yet, it can also be used as a &#8216;native gauging&#8217; expressed in gesture or body posture, related to intuition, instinct, and the rare &#8216;thinking in image&#8217;. As such, it describes approaching &#8216;critical boundary&#8217; (versus &#8216;reaching&#8217;) as auto-limiting. A crucial finding is that &#8216;spontaneous&#8217; behaviours (non-induced, non-intended) can ensure the integrity of health under operation in most conditions, and stop extremes. Yet, they are usually deemed meaningless, random or useless, and are systematically suppressed by enculturation and prevented by civilised lifestyles. &#8216;Nexial-topology&#8217; gives a clear meaning to them, and can model the &#8216;ease&#8217; of health and of daily living. It gives access to more basic options, with wider effects, more immediate than all our solutions, often ignored because too obvious. For example, &#8216;global warming&#8217; could be addressed as a non-local property and a deployment into crises to &#8216;stop&#8217;, rather than separate problems of water, resources, heated behaviour, inflammatory and &#8216;water diseases&#8217;.

Helmut Reich's theory of relational and contextual reasoning</field><field name="creator">Buchner, Johannes Lothar Felix</field><field name="description">In the history of the Christian religion there may be no parallel to the Worldwide Church of God&#8217;s radical transformation from a marginal sect to a recognized denomination. Formed around Herbert W. Armstrong (1892-1986), the sect became one of the largest religious media ministries, offering the Plain Truth magazine and the World Tomorrow radio and television programs. After Armstrong&#8217;s death, the sect was headed by Joseph W. Tkach who, before his own death in 1996, reformed some beliefs and practices. He was succeeded by his son, Joseph Tkach, who renounced the sect&#8217;s dependence on Armstrong&#8217;s teachings. A significant issue in this transformation was the Worldwide Church of God&#8217;s adoption of the Christian Doctrine of the Holy Trinity. The cognitive developmental theories of Karl Helmut Reich, of Switzerland, outlined in his book Developing the Horizons of the Mind (Cambridge University Press, 2002), are related to the application of the idea of complementarity, drawn from quantum physics, to the resolution of paradoxical ideas , with some reference to the Doctrine of the Trinity. The focus of the research was on how these leaders, as change agents, were able to demonstrate development of their thinking, (as gauged by their understanding of the Trinity Doctrine) according to Reich&#8217;s stage theory. As the first study of this kind, the results were enlightening and raised hope about the ability of Reich&#8217;s theory to explain the phenomenon studied and also revealed progress in the transformation or conversion of Worldwide Church of God leaders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reich, K.

The thesis proposes that there are significant cultural, social and political forces involved in language retention in childhood and that these forces mediate and shape identity construction in bilingual children. Much of the research literature on childhood bilingualism draws on dominant and established psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic theories of bilingualism and language learning. These theories do not fully explain the impact of broader sociological processes that impact on home language retention and identity construction in young children. Consequently, in early childhood and primary education, pedagogical understandings of bilingualism and language retention have focussed narrowly on learnability issues and cognitive development. Established theories of bilingualism have not fully articulated the intersections between language retention and identity construction in the early years of children&#8217;s lives, where the formation of identity is constantly negotiated, transformed and contested amidst a background of hegemonic English-speaking social fields such as in prior-to-school, school and other community settings. This thesis begins in Chapter One by providing an overview of the limitations of these psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic theories in making connections between identity construction and language retention for children of particular immigrant minority groups. Chapter Two reviews the literature and research. There has been little research in Australia into how bilingual families and their children negotiate identity and language retention. The thesis explores the proposition that the dominance of English and discourses of monolingualism legitimise institutional and educational practices that position young bilingual children, families and educators into marginalised situations in everyday social relations. It is against this field that the research reported here investigated how such sociological factors represent a significant force in children&#8217;s lives by impacting on their retention of their home language. Chapter Three introduces the key theoretical concepts used in this study which draws on Bourdieu&#8217;s theory of social practice (1990, 1991) and the theoretical resources of cultural studies informed, in particular, by concepts from Hall (1992, 1996) and Bhabha (1994, 1998). These conceptual tools enable the study to examine ways in which identity construction and bilingualism accumulate social, cultural and linguistic capital in selective cultural fields, and how these may hinder or promote the retention and learning of languages in children. Chapter Four overviewed the research methodology involved in this study. It incorporated quasi-ethnographic, case study and interpretative approaches using questionnaires, informal interviews, participant observations, field notes, children&#8217;s work and the collection of documentation. The research process began as a pilot study in which 5 adults and 3 children participated. Three interrelated phases followed. The participants in the study included 25 children and 29 family members, including grandparents and parents with different family structures from extended, blended, interethnic and interracial families. An additional 34 caregivers and teachers working in prior-to-school and school settings participated. The first phase involved 14 interviews of parents and grandparents. The second phase involved a case study of parents and their children attending an after-school Spanish Community Languages Program. I interviewed and surveyed 26 children, 13 parents, and 2 staff members. Finally, in the third phase, I surveyed 30 practitioners working with Spanish-speaking Latin American children in prior-to-school and school settings were. The investigation involved the documentation and analysis of young children&#8217;s bilingual experiences using Spanish and English in a range of social fields, such as family life, educational and community settings. As the children and their families are the focus of this study, the children&#8217;s views about growing up with two languages, and family perspectives and aspirations about living, working and raising children in multicultural/multilingual communities, form the basis of the investigation. Furthermore, the data analysis involved the examination of the evidence to ascertain how the power relations in educational and community settings shape and influence children&#8217;s negotiation of identity and the retention of Spanish. Likewise, data relating to caregiver and teacher attitudes towards bilingualism and language retention were also analysed. Chapter Five details the links between diaspora, hybridity and diversity apparent in the cultural histories and heterogeneous make-up of the families and their children. Analysis of the links between Spanish language retention and diversity show that diversity in families is a significant but not conclusive factor in what constituted success in language retention in young children. This analysis examines of the multiple ways in which the families and their children constructed their identities. The influences these constructions have on speaking Spanish were analysed to demonstrate the connections between language retention and identity construction. Chapter Seven draws on the children&#8217;s views, experiences and preferences for speaking Spanish to analyse how the linguistic habitus enables the accumulation of cultural and social capital in speaking Spanish across a variety of social fields. Finally, Chapter Eight provides an analysis of how teachers&#8217; and caregivers&#8217; attitudes towards bilingualism and language retention can impede or promote opportunities for children&#8217;s language retention. In particular, the evidence indicates that the lack of institutional and structural support for community languages had a direct impact on children&#8217;s interest in using Spanish in both mainstream and non mainstream educational settings. Four key findings emerged through the data analysis presented in the evidentiary chapters of this thesis. First, diaspora and hybridity highlighted the significance of the heterogeneity in Latin American families. Second, it was revealed that multiple constructions of identity mediated everyday lived experiences of being bilingual. Third, the linguistic habitus was significant in shaping children&#8217;s identity across different social and cultural fields. Fourth, teacher and caregiver attitudes and pedagogical practices towards bilingualism and language retention shaped children&#8217;s identity construction and opportunities for using Spanish. In conclusion, this study revealed that there is a strong connection between identity construction and language retention in young bilingual children. In particular, the study highlights the significance of multiplicity and hybridity in shaping identity which in turn forms dispositions that can enable the formation, reproduction and transformation of cultural and social capital. This study investigated the broader sociological factors associated with growing up bilingual and how these mediate and shape children&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;s understanding of themselves and their families, in terms of how they negotiate two (or more) linguistic codes. Hence, the study has contributed towards a reframing of understandings about bilingualism and language retention in childhood.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bilingualism in children</field><field name="subject">language acquisition</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">Latin Americans</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/30505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The texts of Alice A. Bailey : an inquiry into the role of esotericism in transforming consciousness</field><field name="creator">Wightman, Isobel</field><field name="description">This thesis places for consideration the esoteric teachings of Alice A. Bailey, written between 1919 and 1949, as part of the theosophical current of western esotericism. Bailey&#8217;s overarching concern for human betterment underpins her appropriation of esoteric thought, into a reformulation that incorporates her own version of Christian faith. Bailey argues that humanity faces a major turning point, involving a reorientation towards spiritual living. Alongside the vast number of contemporary writers seeking similar goals, Bailey&#8217;s work constitutes another voice attempting to foster such change. Investigating how well the esoteric contents of Bailey&#8217;s work serve her intention drive this research. The author follows with some critical reflections upon Bailey&#8217;s work with relation to its potential to transform consciousness, reorienting a reader towards spiritual living and human betterment. After exploring aspects of her work considered opposite to transforming consciousness, the author speculates upon how Bailey&#8217;s texts might achieve her goal. In essence, it is found that any transformation that may occur through exposure to Bailey&#8217;s texts results from a reader&#8217;s own efforts at penetrating to the heart of esoteric thought, and not through the adoption or application of esotericism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">philosophical anthropology</field><field name="subject">social change</field><field name="subject">theosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/30507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theoretical and empirical study of stock market development, economic reform and economic growth : a case study of Arab countries</field><field name="creator">Abu-Sharia, Rateb Moh'd Ahmad</field><field name="description">The relationship between stock market development and economic growth has been an important issue of debate. A well functioning stock market can affect economic growth through the channelling of more saving to investment and the improvement of capital productivity with efficient allocation of resources. This contrasts with the view that stock market development has little relevance, or is even unimportant, to real economic activity. In this respect, the majority of the empirical studies are concerned with advanced markets and developed emerging markets, and none exist for Arab markets. The argument of this study is that economic growth is a function of stock market development and economic reform indicators, with the main determinants of growth as the control variables set. The study considered a comprehensive theoretical framework that linked stock market development to economic growth. It presented a comparative assessment on macroeconomic level and stock market development indicators for the Arab countries with the East Asia-Pacific countries and the G-7 economies. The most important finding indicated that Arab stock markets have no significant effect on economic growth due to the lack of transparency and illiquidity that limit the effectiveness of these markets in the economy. In contrast, the results from the East Asia-Pacific countries and the G-7 economies suggested that stock market development has a significant effect on, and is positively correlated with, economic growth.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stock exchanges</field><field name="subject">Arab countries</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="subject">economic policy</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31782</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A gastronomic meditation : on McDonald's</field><field name="creator">Sheringham, Colin J.</field><field name="description">The thesis offers a gastronomic meditation on the ambiguity and complexity of meanings signified by McDonald&#8217;s as one of the most powerful food symbols of the late twentieth-century Western society. Using an advance on the structuralist perspective, the thesis argues that it is important to understand food not simply as a surface representation of the social order but as a product of a constant, constitutive dialectic between order and disorder and a dual perception of order. The search for the complex meanings of McDonald&#8217;s is pursued firstly by bringing the concept of disorder to centre stage to form a dialectic relationship between order and disorder; secondly, by setting McDonald&#8217;s at the interface of modernity and post modernity, positioned in an intersection of two competing versions of the history of food and of order as expressed through food. Here the dominant historical narrative expresses the triumph of the order of the bourgeoisie through the work of Elias and &#8216;the civilizing process&#8217;, with the counter-narrative of Bakhtin&#8217;s theory of the carnivalesque highlighting the continuing importance of disorder. These narratives are explored at two key moments of food history, where the order/disorder dialectic can be seen to play a different role. The first is the interface of medieval &#8216;disorder&#8217; and the coming bourgeois order of modernity, where Rabelais is the key text and secondly; the early nineteenth-century, where Brillat-Savarin is used as a marker of the triumph of eighteenth-century rationalism. It is only by reference to the order/disorder dialectic and the duality of order that the ambiguity of complex food symbols such as McDonald&#8217;s can be better understood, and thus become, importantly, a meditation on the nature of society in the pursuit of an examined existence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">McDonald's Restaurants Ltd</field><field name="subject">fast food restaurants</field><field name="subject">food</field><field name="subject">food habits</field><field name="subject">consumer behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/31861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Total quality management and productivity in industrial corporations in Jordan</field><field name="creator">Al-Khawaldeh, Khleef A.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this analytical study is to determine the degree of application of Total Quality Management (TQM) philosophy and practices in the industrial corporations in Jordan. Through detailed examination of primary and secondary empirical data from these corporations, the study examines the link between TQM and labour productivity. The population of the study consists of all Jordanian shareholding corporations listed under the industrial category in Amman Stock Exchange. In late 1998, this consisted of a total of 90 companies. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analysed in investigating the relationship between TQM implementation and labour productivity. Detailed survey responses from 76 participating companies were classified into two groups: high-level TQM implementation and low-level TQM implementation. About 60% of these companies were classified as companies with high-level TQM. Descriptive analysis of the survey responses plus company report data found that mean labour productivity measurements for companies with high-level TQM were significantly higher than for those with low-level TQM over the years (1993-1998). Also mean growth rates of labour productivity measurements for companies with high-level TQM were higher than for those with low-level of TQM during this period. Regression analysis demonstrated a statistically significant positive relationship between TQM and labour productivity. This relationship showed a high positive slope in companies with ISO 9000 certification, and considerably lower (but still positive) slope in companies without ISO 9000 certification.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">Total Quality Management</field><field name="subject">industrial corporations Jordan</field><field name="subject">labour productivity</field><field name="subject">Jordanian shareholding</field><field name="subject">Amman Stock Exchange</field><field name="subject">corporations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a farming systems approach to tree nut research in Malawi</field><field name="creator">Hancock, Wayne Mitchell</field><field name="description">This thesis covers years of field work in Malawi, Africa by the author as a Research Agronomist (Tree Nuts) for the Government of Malawi. The thesis is an action research type with core and thesis projects which are closely linked. The client group are large estate managers who control the tree nut industries in Malawi. The political, economic and historical perspectives are different from those commonly faced by Australian agronomists and the isolated location of the work make this a unique study. The thesis includes sections on plantation or estate agriculture, farming systems approaches to research and problem solving, systems concepts in agricultural settings and action research concepts. These provide a framework for the study within the constraints of the government research system and industry expectations. The body of the thesis is a review paper presented to estate managers and co-researchers after one year's work. Relevant outcomes of the study are presented. The discussion draws together the outcomes through reflection on the process and methods used.

H.</field><field name="description">This study examines sources of clergy stress and ministers' coping strategies. The aim was to investigate Calvinist worldviews and their effects on Presbyterian ministers' choice of coping and stress levels. Specific hypotheses and questions were derived from process-stress theory and applications in the psychology of religion, as well as from secularisation theory. The author designed and conducted three separate, related studies. The first used 54 theological students comprising the pre-ministry stage. The second, focal study was of 65 parish ministers of the Presbyterian Church in NSW. These groups were chosen for an intensive study of the influence of Calvinist beliefs on stress and coping over two stages of ministry. The third surveyed 363 adult church attenders of Presbyterian congregations in NSW for specific analyses of stress-coping processes. Data were obtained through scales, questionnaires and interviews with parish ministers. Presbyterian students scored high on religious commitment but low in their endorsement of Calvinist beliefs. Presbyterian congregations also scored high on religious commitment and moderately high on their endorsement of Presbyterian beliefs. Major findings related to attributions and religious coping. Congregational members attributed life crises and hassles to God's allowing the situation, together with other human causes. Ministers had high religious commitment and agreement with Calvinist beliefs. One third scored at clinical levels of anxiety and burnout. Stress levels were strongly related to using an external locus of coping and less strongly to deficiencies in training and equipment for ministry. These stress levels were not directly related to role conflict or specific situational measures. Overall, findings pointed to inadequacies in process-stress theory for examining occupational stress. Ministry stress was best explained as a consequence of attempts to live out a Calvinist ideal in the absence of institutional and social legitimation</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Presbyterian</field><field name="subject">minister</field><field name="subject">Calvinist</field><field name="subject">congregation</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">religious</field><field name="subject">secular</field><field name="subject">theology</field><field name="subject">parish</field><field name="subject">clergy</field><field name="subject">belief</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/46</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Going walkabout through the suburbs</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Robbie</field><field name="description">This work explores human consciousness, using a framework of the Structure of Feelings and Experience developed from the work of Raymond Williams and Bernard Smith.

South West Sydney, a major growth region within Sydney, includes the Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Liverpool, Campbelltown, Camden and Wollondilly. This region has absorbed 25% of Sydney&#8217;s population growth in the period from 1991-2001. Although South West Sydney has experienced rapid population growth, this has not been matched by associated employment growth. In some sectors such as business services employment growth has been minimal in the previous decade, this is particularly the case in Liverpool, the regional centre of South West Sydney. Population growth is estimated to continue at the current rate (in excess of 5% per annum) for at least the next fifteen years. In this environment, local government authorities in the region are seeking ways in which to develop the regional economy of South West Sydney and increase the amount of sustainable employment commensurably with current population and labour force increases. The role of innovative activity has a central place in economic development. This thesis uses a &#8216;systems of innovation&#8217; (SI) approach to examine innovative activity in the South West Sydney region. SI understands innovation as a socially embedded process of transforming ideas and knowledge into novel products, processes and services through the processes of learning and searching. The approach recognises that innovative activity is determined by various actors (firms and institutions) and the interactivity between these actors and the cumulative base of knowledge in which they operate. The Regional Innovations Systems (RIS) framework develops from an acknowledgement that innovation is primarily a geographically bounded phenomenon. The RIS approach sees that specific local resources are important in determining and encouraging the innovative activities carried out by local firms and hence, the competitiveness of these areas. The RIS literature provides two fields of understanding of what constitutes a regional innovation system. The first takes the global examples of highly innovative regions such as Silicon Valley and Route 128 in the United States of America (Saxenian 1994), South West England (Cooke and Morgan 1998), Baden Wurttemberg in Germany (Cooke 2001; Braczyk, Cooke et al. 2004), Northern Italy (Piore and Sabel 1984) and in Australia, the North Ryde corridor (Searle and Pritchard 2005). These regions represent &#8216;ideal&#8217; or &#8216;star&#8217; RIS, with highly specialised and networked clusters of firms, many forms of supporting regional infrastructure, and high levels of interactivity. The second and emerging field understands RIS to be in existence in all regions and individual RIS are identified on a scale from weak to strong (Wiig and Wood 1995; Cooke and Morgan 1998; Cooke 2001). This second stream includes the analysis of regions seeking to encourage innovative activity by using the RIS approach to examine their local resources and connectedness. It seeks to determine how not only local resources but also their connectedness could be enhanced to increase firm competitiveness. The innovation systems represented in the &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;ideal&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; regions are largely a world away from what is available and what is necessary in the encouragement of RIS in most other regions. However, the conceptual framework for examining and interpreting RIS is derived from the analysis of these &#8216;ideal&#8217; regions. This framework does not provide for measurement and effective interpretation of a range of activities that may be present in less exceptional regions. This research contributes to this endeavour by providing a method that allows for interpretation of a wider range of innovation activities through the analysis of knowledge intensive services activities (KISA). The focus on knowledge gathering, particularly through the KISA analysis, provides an examination of the relationship between innovation, learning and knowledge, much more so than more traditional measures of innovative activity e.g. patents and research and development (RandD) expenditure. KISA analysis is an emerging field of innovation research. KISA are closely linked to firm innovative activity (OECD 2006) and through an analysis of regional KISA usage, an understanding of innovation and knowledge activities within the region can be constructed. This analysis applies equally across various regions and provides an opportunity to guide regional economic development policy intervention at the local government level in South West Sydney.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regional planning</field><field name="subject">regional economics</field><field name="subject">technological innovations</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Western Sydney (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="subject">industries</field><field name="subject">KISA</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/36077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a more effective agricultural graduate : a curriculum conceptual framework</field><field name="creator">Langford, Kenneth V.</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses overtly, on developing undergraduate curricula both generally and specifically in agriculture and related fields and covertly, on an appeal to raise the status, quality and products of undergraduate education. A closer examination is made of the relationship between the structure, function and purpose of tertiary education, the immediate and long-term professional needs of the undergraduate student and the current and future requirements of the communities in which graduates will study, lead, live, learn and work. It is my contention that the reality and challenge of the undergraduate student&#8217;s on and off-campus community experiences should be the catalyst, motivation and transformational cauldron for their professional and personal development and that their curriculum should be designed, delivered, assessed and reported to reflect this individual development. I argue that currently this is not the case and consequently students graduating from more traditionally designed and delivered courses are less prepared for a changing and changeable world. Primary and secondary research evidence presented supports this position. A universal remedial model, schema or conceptual framework emerging from the assimilation of primary and secondary research, is presented and substantially explained. The schema is so designed that a wide variety of core curricula could be developed based on context, need and circumstance. The intricate design of the schema as a &#8220;mandala&#8221; was inspired by a creative fusing of ancient western, ancient eastern and modern philosophies however, a wide range of essential underpinning &#8216;developmental&#8217;, &#8216;educational&#8217; and &#8216;learning&#8217; theories are integrated into its structure and function. The &#8220;Twilight Curriculum&#8221;, a unique component of the schema was inspired by theories relating to the &#8220;Hidden Curriculum&#8221; and &#8220;Self Determined Learning&#8221;. It focuses on the development of wisdom through interest and needs-based action research / action learning projects. Wisdom in this argument emerges in the student as attributes such as professionalism, cognisance, compotency, autonomy, synergism, perspicacity, persistence and expertise all of which contribute to the student&#8217;s overall character. Contextually relative praxis development central to the student&#8217;s personal and professional transformation, is presented as the generator of wisdom. An argument is made in Chapter 1 that universities generally have two sides &#8220;an espoused&#8221; and &#8220;an actual&#8221; this duplicity tends to diminish the veracity of the university&#8217;s purpose and subsequently stifles undergraduate curricular innovation and development. This confusion ultimately reduces a graduate&#8217;s professional effectiveness. Chapter 2 focuses on the role of the agricultural graduate in helping the community1 cope with an increasingly complex and changeable world. Chapter 3 presents 1 Community refers to collectives based on many uniting properties, forces and boundaries, some of which are: locale, family, social networks, culture, religion, ethnicity, norms and habits, common purpose, professional pursuits.(Smith, 2001) the primary research process focusing on the research question &#8216;What are the conceptual framework design properties for an undergraduate, agricultural core curriculum that is grounded in community?&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; The Research Methodology is discussed and theoretically underpinned. The three quantitative and qualitative research instruments and their respective theoretical foundations are explained and validated. The research was conducted with staff and students in two agricultural institutions, one in India and the other in the United States of America. The research results for the three instruments are presented in Chapter 4. The results across the three research instruments indicate a desire by both staff and students for a general change in the structure, function, delivery and assessment of the undergraduate agricultural curriculum. Staff and students&#8217; indicated a change from the current generic, teacher/subject based, theoretical approach to curriculum design, delivery and assessment, to a preferred specific, student / needs based and applied approach. These research results are analysed and discussed at length in Chapter 5. An overview argument is proposed suggesting that learning is a personal journey and that knowledge resides in the experience of the learner, however that journey can be enhanced by not only the nature of the experience but also the critical sense made. Chapter 5 also provides clarity for the results in the form of secondary research. This mainly focuses on a variety of learning theories, student development theory, community engagement theory and preferred graduate attributes as well as an array of the author&#8217;s professional experiences that related directly to the research. Assimilating the primary and secondary results provide not only an answer to the research question, but also partially lay the foundation for the core curriculum schema design. The conceptual framework design properties for designing the core curriculum schema are: individualised personal and professional transformative learning cultivated within relevant on and off campus community engaged environments and facilitated by concerned academics, that incorporate mutually beneficial relationships between self, others and the setting using praxis development as the central educative process resulting in the development through action learning and action research projects of generic and specific attributes that are periodically formatively and summatively assessed. The properties identified in Chapters 5 and 6 are applied in the development of a unique undergraduate agricultural core curriculum schema or model in Chapter 7. Curriculum Theory, Educational Theory, Community Engagement Theory, Rural Development Theory, Graduate Attribute Theory, ancient history and Eastern Philosophy, the author&#8217;s secondary and tertiary teaching experiences, his professional and rural development activities are discussed and provide an underpinning for the schema development process. In this chapter a philosophical argument about &#8216;who owns the curriculum, who owns the learning&#8217; is presented, drawing upon ancient Chinese Taoist ideas in a generic and specific quest for wisdom. The Taoist Yin and Yang are symbolically converted into a scholarly relationship between theory and practice, as praxis. The author&#8217;s praxis development of the core curriculum schema has also generated several innovative concepts, models, expressions and processes, such as: &#8226; The Twilight Curriculum&#8212;the individual student&#8217;s self-initiated personal and professional development. &#8226; The concept of &#8216;compotency&#8217;&#8212;a hybridisation of concepts such as capability, capacity and competency. &#8226; A model for Praxis Development incorporating a figure eight loop that integrates research, experience and compotency. &#8226; The notion of Career Constructivism&#8212;building effectiveness initiated through critical on and off-campus community experience. &#8226; Presenting a curriculum model as Mandala&#8212;an ancient Sanscrit geoglyph style based on intricate, interconnected and convoluted circles with priority positioning towards the centre. &#8226; The notion of a Venn Trigram as a model for describing student development pathways from epistemic framework to personal and professional attributes. &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; The notion of integrated three stage development modes as nested ellipsoids. In Chapter 8 the Undergraduate Core Curriculum Mandala constructed in Chapter 6 is &#8216;reverse engineered&#8217; in order to more fully explain the components in particular, the developmental process as an evolution from epistemic sources to effective student attributes producing job ready graduates who have truly learnt how to learn. Chapter 9 presents a conclusion to the thesis. The research outcomes are briefly re-outlined and attention is drawn to the plight of rural communities and the need for a different kind of graduate&#8212;a need that could be satisfied by utilising the proposed Core Curriculum Schema to inform undergraduate curriculum design. Reservations are expressed about challenges to the status quo in modern commercial universities in that staff and student cultures are so ingrained that adoption of the proposed schema or any such diversion from a traditional model,would not be an easy. I believe that a transformational journey of approaches to undergraduate education is inevitable if undergraduate agriculture in particular is to remain viable as a tertiary field of study. Chapter 9 is concluded with a personal reflection of the scope and focus of this thesis. A plea is made for raising the status of the undergraduate curriculum as a finale to the argument.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agricultural education</field><field name="subject">curriculum planning</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/18804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiation synthesis of polymeric hydrogels for swelling-controlled drug release studies</field><field name="creator">Swami, Salesh N.</field><field name="description">Hydrogels are three dimensional networks of hydrophilic homopolymers or copolymers generally covalently or ionically crosslinked.

This study concerns the investigation of the swelling and the controlled drug release behaviour of hydrogels synthesized via the photopolymerisation process. The study of hydrogels in this project was oriented towards their biomedical applications as controlled drug delivery devices. It is a known fact that the complete conversion of monomers to polymers may not be achieved in the polymerisation process thus there is always a certain component of unreacted toxic monomers still remained in the polymer matrix. These monomers have the tendency to leach out of the polymer matrices when the polymers are in contact with an aqueous medium thus rendering the hydrogel to be nonbiocompatable. The polymers synthesized in this work were washed thoroughly in milli-Q-water and then evaluated in vitro for any possible toxic effect on human keratinocyte (HaCaT)v cells using a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diaphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assay. The cytotoxicity results indicated that the hydrogels understudy sustained and allowed a positive growth of the HaCat cells in the duration of the cytotoxicity experiment, thus proving to be satisfactorily compatible.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polymeric drug delivery systems</field><field name="subject">colloids</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A participative learning approach to agricultural development : a Ghanaian case</field><field name="creator">Amezah, Agbenyega</field><field name="description">This dissertation is the documentation of a participative learning project with the purpose of facilitating improvement in farming and agricultural development work in the Hohoe district of Ghana.

Continuous innovation is a concept that requires a methodical, programmed, incremental and/or radical approach to business improvement involving employees at all levels in the organisational structure. Theories and models of innovation were analysed in the literature, at the outset of this research. As found by previous authors, specific characteristics of service forms did not allow direct application of traditional models of innovation. Most of these traditional models were constructed from the manufacturing perspective. As a result, a new innovation model was designed for this study. It can be used as a guide for understanding the components necessary in service forms to embark on continuous innovation. This model describes the process of service innovation and incorporates theories from literature, and some variables from the CIMA model. The study is exploratory in nature, using empirical data. The study identified, evaluated, compared and contrasted the factors in ten Distribution Centres in Australia and in Singapore that affected the use of continuous innovation in their operations and processes. The focus of the study investigated the drivers, capabilities, behaviours, contingencies, individual competencies and performance measures of innovation in Distribution Centres with logistics services. Overall, this study has made significant contributions in terms of the theoretical investigation adding to the body of literature. This study was exploratory, using case studies as a first hand approach in gaining an understanding of Distribution Centres. There are areas that would merit further investigation and future research. It suggested that additional work should be carried out to expand on this research and refine the model to meet the needs of a wider range of organisations in various service industries. In addition, there are recommendations flowing from this study concerning the practical management of logistics operations. They are addressed mainly to senior management who typically take lead in the implementation of innovative programmes within the organisation. Firms should address continuous innovation as a planned and integrated approach, taking into account many interacting factors that are essential for successful innovation. The challenge facing Distribution Centres is to develop efficient and flexible processes and systems, by continuously innovating to sustain a leading edge in the logistics industry</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">logistics</field><field name="subject">distribution centres</field><field name="subject">innovation, Australia</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">data</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Queuing disciplines on Linux made easy</field><field name="creator">Braithwaite, Stephen</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This is a project to implement a Mice and Elephants queueing discipline, which favoursshort flows over long flows, on Linux.

In the Australian context, research investigating mature consumers is an emerging area with limited knowledge relating to their use of SSTs.Through extending the original technology acceptance model (TAM), a well-established model from the information technology domain, this thesis incorporated six external variables into the model and investigated the use of SSTs among mature consumers in the financial services context. The thesis also examined the moderating effects of demographic characteristics on the relationships within the extended TAM (ETAM).Using cross sectional data from a sample of 208 mature consumers in Study 1, the original TAM and ETAM were tested. Based on these findings, improvements were made for Study 2, where the modified models were tested on data from a national sample of 2,253 mature consumers. Path analysis indicated that self-efficacy, technology discomfort, perceived risk and personal contact made a significant unique contribution to predicting attitude and behaviour over and above the two belief variables in TAM, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. The four variables in the ETAM were significant predictors of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Results also suggested that age and education act as moderating variables in this model. These findings can serve as a basis for designing educational and communication strategies to foster greater use of SSTs in the financial context among mature consumers.A second aim of this thesis was to explore usage patterns of self-service banking technologies (SSBTs) among different segments of the mature consumer market in Australia. The diversity of the mature consumer market was reflected through establishing three behavioural segments, namely non-users, low users and medium-to-high users of SSBTs, providing a deeper understanding of mature consumers&#8217; knowledge and patterns of behaviour towards using these technologies and personal services in the financial context.The findings contributed to the understanding of mature consumers&#8217; behaviour towards SSBTs for academics, financial practice and policy formation by government and not-for-profit senior organisations responsible for improving financial literacy and productive ageing among mature consumers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mature</field><field name="subject">consumers;</field><field name="subject">attitudes;</field><field name="subject">self-service</field><field name="subject">banking</field><field name="subject">technologies;</field><field name="subject">self-service</field><field name="subject">technologies;</field><field name="subject">financial</field><field name="subject">services;</field><field name="subject">consumer</field><field name="subject">resistance;</field><field name="subject">consumer</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003554/</field></doc><doc><field name="title" /><field name="creator">O'Brien, Maxine</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Only a minority of Australian women continue to breastfeed for what is known to be the optimal duration for the health of the mother and her baby.

This two-phase study was conducted in Toowoomba, Queensland and began with a qualitative enquiry involving three groups of mothers separated according to their various experiences of breastfeeding, and one group of experienced breastfeeding clinicians (n = 21). Using the nominal group technique, these women were asked to generate a list of the psychological factors they believed influenced the duration of breastfeeding. Group results were considered individually and collectively, and comparisons between groups were made. The groups generated a list of 53 psychological factors they believed may have an influence on the duration of breastfeeding. In Phase 2, these data and the extant literature were used to inform the content of a questionnaire constructed to measure the relevant individual psychological characteristics of a sample of postnatal women, and the relationship between these factors and breastfeeding duration to 6 months postpartum. Participants for Phase 2 were recruited from one public and one private hospital in the regional city of Toowoomba, Queensland (n = 372), and completed a self-report questionnaire during the 14 days following the birth. Telephone interviews at 6 months postpartum gathered data regarding the woman&#8217;s current feeding method and time of weaning. The duration of breastfeeding was associated with psychological factors including dispositional optimism, breastfeeding self-efficacy, faith in breastmilk, breastfeeding expectations, anxiety, planned duration of breastfeeding and the time of the infant feeding decision. After removing the effect of socio-demographic variables, the woman&#8217;s faith in breastmilk and her planned breastfeeding duration were unique predictors of the duration of Fully breastfeeding. Analysis of the data for the duration of Any breastfeeding revealed three unique predictors including faith in breastmilk, planned breastfeeding duration and breastfeeding self-efficacy. The data also showed that 44% of the sample experienced some form of postnatal distress in the 14 days following the birth in the form of anxiety, stress and/or depression. Of these three distinct states, only anxiety was associated with breastfeeding duration. This enhanced knowledge of the psychological variables which influence breastfeeding duration may be used to construct a tool capable of identifying women at risk of early weaning for additional support or interventions. Additionally, this knowledge may form the basis of an intervention designed to modify psychological variables known to place breastfeeding at risk, thereby assisting women to breastfeed for longer.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">determinants;</field><field name="subject">breastfeeding;</field><field name="subject">duration;</field><field name="subject">breastfeeding</field><field name="subject">duration;</field><field name="subject">breast</field><field name="subject">feeding;</field><field name="subject">psychological</field><field name="subject">factors;</field><field name="subject">Toowoomba</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003626/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward real-time control of surface irrigation</field><field name="creator">Khatri, K. L.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: The performance of surface irrigation is a function of the field design, infiltration characteristic of the soil, and the irrigation management practice. However, the complexity of the interactions makes it difficult for irrigators to identify optimaldesign or management practices. The infiltration characteristic of the soil is the most crucial of all the factors affecting the performance of surface irrigation and both spatial and temporal variations in the infiltration characteristic are a major physicalconstraint to achieving higher irrigation application efficiencies. Real-time optimisation and control has the potential to overcome these spatial and temporalvariations and return highly significant improvements in performance. Calculation of the infiltration parameters from irrigation advance data is now the preferred method.If the process is to be included in a real time control system it must be done accurately, reliably and rapidly, and with a minimum of field data. Substantial workhas been directed towards developing methods to estimate the infiltration characteristics of soil from irrigation advance data. However, none of the existing methods are entirely suitable for use in real time control. The greatest limitation is that they are data intensive and or unreliable and provide soil infiltration propertiesafter an irrigation event.A simple real-time control system for furrow irrigation is proposed that: predicts the infiltration characteristics of the soil in real-time using data measured during anirrigation event, simulates the irrigation, and determines the optimum time to cut-off for that irrigation. The basis of the system is a new method for the Real-timeEstimation of the Infiltration Parameters (REIP) under furrow irrigation, developed during this research study, and that uses a model infiltration curve, and a scalingprocess to predict the infiltration characteristics for each furrow and each irrigation event. The underlying hypothesis for the method is that the shape of the infiltration characteristic for a particular field or soil is relatively constant (across the field andwith time), despite variations in the magnitude of the infiltration rate or amount. A typical furrow in the field is selected for evaluation (known as the model furrow)and its infiltration parameters (a, k, fo) in the Kostiakov&#8211;Lewis equation are determined by a model such as INFILT or IPARM using inflow, advance and runoffdata. Subsequently the infiltration parameters for this model furrow can be scaled to give the cumulative infiltration curves for the whole field. In this process a scaling factor (F) is formulated from rearrangement of the volume balance equation and is calculated for each furrow/event using the model infiltration parameters and the single advance point. The performance of each furrow can then be simulated and optimised using an appropriate simulation model to determine the preferred time tocut-off.Using this new method, infiltration parameters were calculated for two different fields T &amp; C. The SIRMOD simulation model was then used to simulate irrigationperformance (application efficiency, requirement efficiency and uniformity) under different model strategies. These strategies were framed to assess the feasibility of and demonstrate the gains from the real-time control strategy. The infiltration evaluation results revealed that the infiltration curves produced by the proposed method were of similar shape and hence gave a distribution of cumulative depths of infiltration for the whole field that was statistically equivalent to that given using the complete set of advance data for each furrow. The advance trajectories produced bythe proposed method also matched favourably to the measured advances.The simulation results showed firstly that the scaled infiltration gave predictions of the irrigation performance similar to the actual performance. They also indicated that by adopting the simple real time control system, irrigation application efficiencies forthe two fields could be improved from 76% for field T and 39% for field C (under usual farm management) to 83% and 70% for the fields T &amp; C, respectively. Savingsof 1239 m3 in the total volume of water applied per irrigation over the area of 7.1 ha of both fields were indicated, which can be used beneficially to grow more crop. The proposed real-time control system is shown to be feasible. It requires few data for itsoperation and provides the infiltration characteristics for each furrow without significant loss of accuracy. The irrigation performance is improved greatly from thatachieved under current farmer management and a substantial reduction in the volume of water applied per irrigation is achievable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface</field><field name="subject">irrigation;</field><field name="subject">irrigation</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">systems;</field><field name="subject">real-time</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004109/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining web data mining techniques for web page access prediction</field><field name="creator">Khalil, Faten</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Web page access prediction gained its importance from the ever increasing number of e-commerce Web information systems and e-businesses. Web page prediction, that involves personalising the Web users&#8217; browsing experiences, assists Web masters in the improvement of the Web site structure and helps Web users in navigating the site and accessing the information they need. The most widely used approach for this purpose is the pattern discovery process of Web usage mining that entails many techniques like Markov model, association rules and clustering. Implementing pattern discovery techniques as such helps predict the next page tobe accessed by theWeb user based on the user&#8217;s previous browsing patterns. However, each of the aforementioned techniques has its own limitations, especiallywhen it comes to accuracy and space complexity. This dissertation achieves better accuracy as well as less state space complexity and rules generated by performingthe following combinations. First, we combine low-order Markov model and association rules. Markov model analysis are performed on the data sets. If the Markov model prediction results in a tie or no state, association rules are used for prediction. The outcome of this integration is better accuracy, less Markov model state space complexity and less number of generated rules than using each of the methods individually. Second, we integrate low-order Markov model and clustering. The data sets are clustered and Markov model analysis are performed oneach cluster instead of the whole data sets. The outcome of the integration is better accuracy than the first combination with less state space complexity than higherorder Markov model. The last integration model involves combining all three techniques together: clustering, association rules and low-order Markov model. The data sets are clustered and Markov model analysis are performed on each cluster. If the Markov model prediction results in close accuracies for the same item, association rules are used for prediction. This integration model achievesbetter Web page access prediction accuracy, less Markov model state space complexity and less number of rules generated than the previous two models.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">web</field><field name="subject">page</field><field name="subject">access</field><field name="subject">prediction;</field><field name="subject">web</field><field name="subject">usage</field><field name="subject">mining;</field><field name="subject">Markov</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004341/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crossing borders: a Formosan's postcolonial

Annie Heloise Abel (1873&#150;1947) was one of only thirty American women to earn
a PhD in history prior to the First World War. She was the first academically
trained historian in the United States to consider the development of Indian&#150;white
relations and, although her focus was narrowly political and her methodology
almost entirely archival-based, in this she was a pioneer. Raised in the bucolic
atmosphere of a late-Victorian Sussex village, at the age of twelve she became an actual pioneer when her parents moved to the Kansas frontier in the 1880s. She was the third
child and eldest daughter among seven remarkable siblings, children of a Scottish
gardener, each of whom obtained a college education and fulfilled the American
dream of financial stability and status.
Annie Abel&#146;s academic career was one of rare success for a woman of the
period and she studied at Kansas, Cornell, Yale, and Johns Hopkins universities.
She was the first woman to win a Bulkley scholarship to Yale, where her doctoral
thesis won her an American Historical Association award and was published in its
annual report. As well as college teaching, for a short time she was historian at the
Office (now Bureau) of Indian Affairs in Washington, DC, and was also involved
in women&#146;s suffrage issues. She reached the peak of her academic teaching career
as a history professor at Smith College in Massachusetts, one of the country&#146;s
most prestigious women&#146;s institutions of higher learning.
She combined her teaching with research and wrote some minor pieces prior
to her major work, a three-volume political history of the Indian Territory during
the American Civil War, which was published between 1915 and 1925. Her life
took an unexpected turn while on a research sabbatical in Australia when, aged
nearly fifty, she found romance and then experienced a disastrous, short-lived
marriage. Undeterred, she returned to America and continued to pursue her
primary professional interest as an independent researcher, winning grants that
took her to England and Canada, until her retirement to Aberdeen, Washington, in
the 1930s. During this latter period of her life Annie Abel-Henderson (as she now
styled herself) produced no original works but continued to publish editions of
historically important manuscripts, work she had begun early in her career. Her
research interests also covered early North American exploration narratives and,
as an extension of her work on Indian&#150;white relations, she had planned an
ambitious, comparative study of United States and British Dominion policy
towards colonised peoples. As a reviewer, her historical expertise was long sought
by the leading academic history journals of the day. Before her death at seventy four
from carcinoma, her final years were busy with war relief work and
occasional writing.
No full-length work has yet appeared on this pioneer historian and this
dissertation seeks to evaluate Annie Heloise Abel&#146;s work by a close reading of her
textual legacy&#151;original, editorial and commentarial&#151;and to assess her
importance in American historiography.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Historiography</field><field name="subject">US Indian Policy</field><field name="subject">Women Historians</field><field name="subject">Biography</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060713.154515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY OF MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS: A Case Study of Village Credit Institutions in Gianyar, Bali, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Arsyad, Lincolin</field><field name="description">Microfinance institutions have evolved as an economic development tool intended to benefit low-income people. The benefit, however, can only be achieved if the institutions have a good financial and outreach performance. This study has three objectives. The first objective is to assess the influences of informal and formal institutions and their interrelationships on the practical operational arrangement of Village Credit Institutions of Bali (Lembaga Perkreditan Desa or LPD). Second, to evaluate the financial performance and outreach indicators of the institutions and to assess the influence of informal and formal institution on the sustainability of the institutions, which has received little attention from previous studies. Finally, to outline some elements of a strategic business plan for two selected village credit institutions (LPDs) in Gianyar district, LPD Mas and LPD Kerta. 

By using a case study approach, this study finds that the informal institutions (such as social values, norms, and sanctions) have significant influences on the practical arrangements of the LPDs, including the organisation, recruitment procedure, delivery mechanism, and remuneration system. Along with the influence of informal institutions, the formal institutions have also had some direct influences on the practical operational arrangements of the LPDs that are reflected in the supervision and guidance system of LPDs, an obligation to apply prudential principles of banking, and the remuneration system. The findings also show that the local government regulations (formal institutions) concerning the LPDs have accommodated the informal institutions of the Balinese in the background of their establishment, status and ownership, and organisation of the LPDs. 

Based on the performance indicators - portfolio quality, leverage, capital adequacy ratio (CAR), productivity, efficiency, profitability, self-sufficiency, and outreach &#239;&#191;&#189; the LPDs in Gianyar district could be considered as success microfinance institutions. The success is influenced by some important factors. First, the use of local people in managing the LPDs and the application of character-based lending system in screening the clients. This has resulted in a high clients&#239;&#191;&#189; sense of belonging and moral obligation to support the development of the LPD Second, the use of social (custom) sanctions in the contractual enforcement has forced the borrowers to comply with their credit contract in a timely fashion. Third, the use of local community personnel whose remuneration is based on performance and low transaction costs has resulted in the high efficiency of LPDs. Fourth, a growing economy and supporting government policy at all levels through provision of a legal basis for the LPDs and the Central Bank regulation (formal institutions) have also contributed to the success of the LPDs. Thus, based on the necessary conditions of sustainable microfinance institution proposed by some scholars(Yaron 1994; Christen 1998), it can be concluded that the Gianyar district LPDs have been sustainable, and by that implication they have positive net social benefits for their clients. 

Any attempt, however, to replicate the achievements of the LPDs by imitating its mode of operations should be conducted with great caution. A mechanism that works well in one socioeconomic environment (in this instance, in Bali) will not necessarily work in another, where the social system including social norms and values are different.  But, the experience of the LPDs is a valuable thing since it has highlighted some critical issues that should be considered when handling the complex issue providing financial services to rural people.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microfinance institutions</field><field name="subject">low incomes</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">Village Credit Institutions of Bali</field><field name="subject">Lembaga Perkreditan Desa</field><field name="subject">LPD</field><field name="subject">strategic business plan</field><field name="subject">Gianyar district</field><field name="subject">informal institutions</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060621.142512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectral shift function in von Neumann algebras</field><field name="creator">Azamov, Nurulla</field><field name="description">The main subsect of this thesis is the theory of Lifshits-Krein spectral shift function in semifinite von Neumann algebras and its connection with the theory of spectral flow.

Managing Accountability in Community Service Organisations</field><field name="creator">Baulderstone, Joanne Mary</field><field name="description">Community service organisations play a crucial role in the delivery of many social services while functioning from a strong values base often associated with a particular religion. They attempt to respond to the needs of multiple stakeholders. This creates a complex and sometimes ambiguous set of accountability relationships.
Government contributes significantly to the funding of most community service organisations, and often this is reflected in close working relationships between public servants in funding departments and managers of community service organisations. The nature of this relationship was changed as a consequence of a wave of public sector reforms beginning in the 1980s. These reforms aimed to increase the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of government departments. Strategies adopted included funder-purchaser-provider models of service delivery, leading to the contracting out of some services previously provided by government and the adoption of more contract-like agreements with existing external service providers. This led to the development of additional mechanisms for measuring and monitoring performance. These were directed both internally towards public sector staff and externally to funded programs.  
The community services sector&#146;s concern about the impact of reform on their functioning and survival provided the impetus for undertaking this qualitative study of the management of accountability in community service organisations in South Australia. Data were collected in 2000-2001 through interviews with community service organisation and public service staff, and through analysis of organisational documents related to accountability. Staff from twelve community service organisations, and state and federal public servants participated. While the analysis shows the costs to community service organisations and the damage to their relationship with government resulting from reform, it also identifies improvements to the management of accountability in some organisations.
Governments at both state and federal levels have since adopted the language of partnership and collaboration. This occurred partly in recognition of the negative impacts of an over-zealous emphasis on distanced purchaser-provider relationships and partly from an increasing recognition of the failure of existing systems to resolve complex social issues. 
Follow-up data were collected in 2004 that identified changes in the relationships between the community service organisations and funding departments, and in the community service organisations&#146; management of their own accountability. Analysis of these data found a significance increase in formal relationships between community service organisations but limited change in the relationship with government.
Through an analysis of the impact of public sector change on community service organisations in South Australia, this thesis contributes to the understanding of inter-sectoral relationships and the management of accountability in community service organisations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accountability</field><field name="subject">contracting</field><field name="subject">non-profit</field><field name="subject">community service organisations</field><field name="subject">public sector</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20051212.163812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LIFE HISTORY AND CHEMOSENSORY COMMUNICATION IN THE SOCIAL AUSTRALIAN LIZARD,  EGERNIA WHITII</field><field name="creator">Bellamy, Robyn Lyle</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT

Social relationships, habitat utilisation and life history characteristics provide a framework which enables the survival of populations in fluctuating ecological conditions.  An understanding of behavioural ecology is critical to the implementation of Natural Resource Management strategies if they are to succeed in their conservation efforts during the emergence of climate change.  Egernia whitii from Wedge Island in the Spencer Gulf of South Australia were used as a model system to investigate the interaction of life history traits, scat piling behaviour and chemosensory communication in social lizards.  
Juveniles typically took &#161;&#221; 3 years to reach sexual maturity and the results of skeletochronological studies suggested longevity of &#161;&#221; 13 years.  Combined with a mean litter size of 2.2, a pregnancy rate estimated at 75% of eligible females during short-term studies, and highly stable groups, this information suggests several life history features.  
Prolonged juvenile development and adult longevity may be prerequisite to the development of parental care.  Parental care may, in turn, be the determining factor that facilitates the formation of small family groups.  In E. whitii parental care takes the form of foetal and neonatal provisioning and tolerance of juveniles by small family or social groups within established resource areas.  Presumably, resident juveniles also benefit from adult territorialism.  Research on birds suggests that low adult mortality predisposes cooperative breeding or social grouping in birds, and life history traits and ecological factors appear to act together to facilitate cooperative systems.  
E. whitii practice scat piling both individually and in small groups.  Social benefits arising from signalling could confer both cooperative and competitive benefits.  Permanent territorial markers have the potential to benefit conspecifics, congenerics and other species.  The high incidence of a skink species (E. whitii) refuging with a gecko species (N. milii) on Wedge Island provides an example of interspecific cooperation.  The diurnal refuge of the nocturnal gecko is a useful transient shelter for the diurnal skink.  Scat piling may release a species &#161;&#174;signature&#161;&#175; for each group that allows mutual recognition.  
Scat piling also facilitates intraspecific scent marking by individual members, which has the potential to indicate relatedness, or social or sexual status within the group.  The discovery of cloacal scent marking activity is new to the Egernia genus.  E. Whitii differentiate between 

their own scats, and conspecific and congeneric scats.  They scent mark at the site of conspecific scats, and males and females differ in their response to scent cues over time.  Scat piling has the potential to make information concerning the social environment available to dispersing transient and potential immigrant conspecifics, enabling settlement choices to be made.  
This thesis explores some of the behavioural strategies employed by E. whitii to reduce risks to individuals within groups and between groups.  Scents eliciting a range of behavioural responses relevant to the formation of adaptive social groupings, reproductive activity, and juvenile protection until maturity and dispersal are likely to be present in this species.  Tests confirming chemosensory cues that differentiate sex, kin and age would be an interesting addition to current knowledge.  The interaction of delayed maturity, parental care, sociality, chemosensory communication and scat piling highlights the sophistication of this species&#161;&#175; behaviour.  
An alternative method for permanently marking lizards was developed.  Persistence, reliability and individual discrimination were demonstrated using photographic identification and the method was shown to be reliable for broad-scale application by researchers.  Naturally occurring toe loss in the field provided a context against which to examine this alternative identification method and revealed the need to further investigate the consequences of routine toe clipping, as this practice appears to diminish survivorship.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sociality</field><field name="subject">skink</field><field name="subject">life history</field><field name="subject">chemosensory communication</field><field name="subject">scat piling</field><field name="subject">Egernia whitii</field><field name="subject">lizard</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Wedge Island</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">parental care</field><field name="subject">juveniles</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">scent marking</field><field name="subject">territorial markers</field><field name="subject">interspecific cooperation</field><field name="subject">signals</field><field name="subject">markers</field><field name="subject">latrines</field><field name="subject">tongue flick assay</field><field name="subject">social interactions</field><field name="subject">agonism avoidance</field><field name="subject">refuge sharing</field><field name="subject">scent stimuli</field><field name="subject">pattern markings</field><field name="subject">toe-clipping</field><field name="subject">juvenile survival</field><field name="subject">autophagy</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">morphology</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">diet</field><field name="subject">behaviour.</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070514.163902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RESOURCE PARTITIONING BETWEEN

________________________________________</field><field name="creator">Bellamy, Stephen</field><field name="description">When species compete for resources, in a stable homogeneous environment, there are two possible outcomes. The first is that one species will out-compete the other and exclude it from the environment. This is known as the competitive exclusion principle. The second is that both species will manage to coexist. Coexistence can only occur if the species&#146; niches are differentiated such that interspecific competition is minimised, or eliminated. This outcome is known as resource partitioning.
Two closely related Australian skink species of the Egernia genus, Egernia multiscutata and Egernia whitii, are abundant and sympatric on Wedge Island in South Australia&#146;s Spencer Gulf. The species are morphologically very similar and appear to have very similar life histories and habitat requirements. Ostensibly, they would compete for limiting resources in this environment.
This thesis is the first investigation into resource partitioning in this previously unstudied model organism. I report the results of multi-faceted investigations into the coexistence of the skinks, E. multiscutata and E. whitii on Wedge Island and the evidence for, and mechanisms of, any facultative resource partitioning between them.
Study methods involved a transect survey of most of Wedge Island to determine the species&#146; distributions and any evidence for resource partitioning; a morphological comparison to investigate any potential competitive advantages of either species; a habitat choice experiment to establish retreat-site preferences in the absence of interspecific interference; and, a series of staged dyadic encounter experiments to investigate interspecific competitive interactions.
Resource partitioning was evidenced by differential distributions of the species among substrates containing the elements required for permanent refuge shelters. This partitioning was not mediated by avoidance of particular substrates but by the presence of the opponent species, combined with attraction to suitable substrates. Asymmetries in some morphological characters were found to confer a potential competitive advantage to E. multiscutata in agonistic encounters with E. whitii. Both species were found to have the same refuge site preferences when interference competition was experimentally removed. This result was not concordant with observed resource partitioning in the field and suggests that the habitat choices of both species are modified by the presence of the opponent species. Analyses of staged dyadic encounter experiments showed that E. multiscutata was more likely to gain greater access to a contested habitat resource and more likely to exclude E. whitii from the resource than vice-versa. Nevertheless, the outcome of competitive interactions was not completely deterministic and there was some tolerance of co-habitation. E. multiscutata&#146;s competitive advantage was attributable largely to its greater mass and head dimensions relative to snout to vent length. However, differential behavioural responses to the threat of larger opponent size also played an important part in resource partitioning between the species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Egernia</field><field name="subject">whitii</field><field name="subject">multiscutata</field><field name="subject">sympatric</field><field name="subject">resource partitioning</field><field name="subject">skink</field><field name="subject">Wedge Island</field><field name="subject">Spencer Gulf</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">isolating mechanism</field><field name="subject">reptile</field><field name="subject">settlement choice</field><field name="subject">competition</field><field name="subject">logistic regression</field><field name="subject">habitat features</field><field name="subject">habitat differentiation</field><field name="subject">refuge</field><field name="subject">morphological comparisons</field><field name="subject">refuge acquisition</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070124.145924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">METAL ION ACTIVATED ANION SENSORS</field><field name="creator">Bradbury, Adam John</field><field name="description">A series of new, octadentate, fluorescent, macrocyclic ligands have been prepared with a view to using them to study aromatic anion sequestration.

Non-linear least squares regression analysis of the resulting titration curves leads to the determination of binding constants in 20% aqueous 1,4-dioxane which lie in the range 10^2.3 M-1 (benzoate) to 10^7.5 M-1 (2,6-dihydroxybenzoate). By reference to the X-ray determined structures of related, but non-fluorescent inclusion complexes, the primary anion retention force is known to arise from hydrogen bonding between the anion and four convergent hydroxy groups that exist at the base of a cavity that develops in the complexes as their aromatic groups juxtapose upon coordination. This work reveals significant stability enhancement when hydroxy groups are positioned on the anion at points where O-H...pi hydrogen bonding to the aromatic rings that constitute the walls of the cavity becomes geometrically possible.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fluorescence</field><field name="subject">anion</field><field name="subject">host</field><field name="subject">guest</field><field name="subject">anthryl</field><field name="subject">inclusion</field><field name="subject">cyclen</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080319.125059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Travelling Colonial Architecture:


Home and Nation
in
Selected Works by Patrick White,
Peter Carey, Xavier Herbert and James Bardon</field><field name="creator">Brock, Stephen James Thomas</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of constructions of home and nation in selected works by Patrick White, Peter Carey, Xavier Herbert and James Bardon. Drawing on the work of postcolonial theorists, it examines ways in which the selected texts engage with national mythologies in the imagining of the Australian nation. It notes the deployment of racial discourses informing constructions of national identity that work to marginalise Indigenous Australians and other cultural minority groups.
The texts are arranged in thematic rather than chronological order. White&#146;s treatment of the overland journey, and his representations of Aboriginality, discussed in Chapter One, are contrasted with Carey&#146;s revisiting of the overland journey motif in Oscar and Lucinda in Chapter Two. Whereas White&#146;s representations of Indigenous culture in Voss are static and essentialised, as is the case in Riders in the Chariot and A Fringe of Leaves, Carey&#146;s representation of Australia&#146;s contact history is characterised by a cultural hybridity. In White&#146;s texts, Indigenous culture is depicted as an anachronism in the contemporary Australian nation, while in Carey&#146;s, the words of the coloniser are appropriated and employed to subvert the ideological colonial paradigm.
Carey&#146;s use of heteroglossia is examined further in the analysis of Illywhacker in Chapter Three. Whereas Carey treats Australian types ironically in Illywhacker&#146;s pet emporium, the protagonist of Xavier Herbert&#146;s Poor Fellow My Country, Jeremy Delacy, is depicted as an expert on Australian types. The intertextuality between Herbert&#146;s novel and the work of social Darwinist anthropologists in the 1930s and 1940s is discussed in Chapter Four, providing a historical context to appreciate a shift from modernist to postmodernist narrative strategies in Carey&#146;s fiction. 
James Bardon&#146;s fictional treatment of the Papunya Tula painting movement in Revolution by Night is seen to continue to frame Indigenous culture in a modernist grammar of representation through its portrayal of the work of Papunya Tula artists in the terms of &#145;the fourth dimension&#146;. Bardon&#146;s novel is nevertheless a fascinating postcolonial engagement with Sturt&#146;s architectural construction of landscape in his maps and journals, a discussion of which leads to Tony Birch&#146;s analysis of the politics of name reclamation in contemporary tourism discourses.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian literature</field><field name="subject">postcolonial theory</field><field name="subject">race and nation</field><field name="subject">home and nation</field><field name="subject">nationalism</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">representations of Indigenous culture</field><field name="subject">racism</field><field name="subject">national mythologies</field><field name="subject">contact history</field><field name="subject">explorers</field><field name="subject">overland journey</field><field name="subject">constructions of Aboriginality</field><field name="subject">imagining nation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070424.101150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">gamma-Lactones in wine: Synthesis, quantification and sensory studies</field><field name="creator">Brown, Rachel Christine</field><field name="description">gamma-Lactones are found in a wide variety of food and beverage products, in particular grapes and wine.  This thesis details the work completed on some gamma-lactones in wine: their synthetic preparation, development of quantification methodologies and sensory studies.

Chapter 1 outlines the history of the Australian wine industry from the arrival of the first vines on the First Fleet in 1788 with Captain Arthur Philip.  This chapter provides: an overview of Australia&#146;s position in the world of grape and wine production; an analysis of the export arm of the industry; and a look at the different wine producing regions around the country.  The latter part of the chapter focuses on the different volatile compounds found in wine.

Part A:

Chapter 2 provides an overview on the history of barrel manufacture and the use of oak wood in cooperage, with an emphasis on oak&#146;s well known ability to impart desirable characteristics to wine through the extraction of volatile aroma compounds.  This chapter provides a summary of these odorants with a particular emphasis on the oak lactones.  Previous sensory studies and synthetic work are discussed.  Of great importance to this work are the recent advancements in 1,2-dioxine chemistry, highlighted in this chapter.

Chapter 3 details the synthetic work completed for the preparation of all four possible oak lactone stereoisomers.  A suitably substituted racemic 1,2-dioxine featured as the common intermediate and enabled preparation of the gamma-lactone moiety upon reaction with a chiral malonate diester and separation of the diastereomers by column chromatography.  A key step involved the decarboxylation of the ester cleaved gamma-lactone diastereomers, which could be directed to give either the cis- or trans-products.  Standard chemical transformations were then utilised to produce the desired stereoisomers of oak lactone.

Chapter 4 describes the results from the sensory studies that were completed on the synthetic oak lactone samples.  Odour detection thresholds were measured in both a white and a red wine.  The thresholds in the former medium were calculated to be 24 ug/L, 172 ug/L, 132 ug/L and 305 ug/L, while in the latter medium the thresholds were calculated to be 57 ug/L, 380 ug/L, 175 ug/L and 285 ug/L, for (4S,5S)-cis-, (4S,5R)-trans-, (4R,5R)-cis- and (4R,5S)-trans-oak lactone, respectively.  Difference testings were completed on the pairs of enantiomers and also on mixtures of the nature-identical isomers: between the cis-enantiomers a significant difference was found at the 99% confidence level, while between the trans-enantiomers and also the mixtures of cis- and trans-isomers little difference was observed. 

Chapter 5 contains the experimental procedures for Part A.

Part B:

Chapter 6 discusses the sensory properties of some gamma- and delta-lactones, with the focus on a series of five-alkyl substituted gamma-lactones: gamma-octalactone, gamma-nonalactone, gamma-decalactone and gamma-dodecalactone.  Topics covered in this chapter include chirality, biosynthetic pathways and quantification results in wine from previous studies for these gamma-lactones.

Chapter 7 concerns the method development for the quantification of gamma-lactones in wine using a stable isotope dilution assay (SIDA).  Deuterated analogues were prepared from commercially available racemic gamma-lactones for use as internal standards.  Initially a head space solid-phase microextraction (HS SPME) method was developed using d5-standards; however, analysis of bottled wine samples revealed the presence of co-eluting compounds that contained several of the selected ions.  Thus an alternative method was developed using d7-standards, with a specific focus on sample clean-up, via solid-phase extraction (SPE).  Using this procedure, 44 white and 120 red wines were analysed for their gamma-lactone content.  The lactones were found to be significantly more common in the red wines, with gamma-nonalactone the most abundant lactone in this series.

Chapter 8 deals with the extension of the SIDA method, as developed in Chapter 7, for use with a chiral gas chromatography column.  Optically pure standards were prepared, from either L- or D-glutamic acid, and used to determine the order of elution of the enantiomers.  A method was developed for the quantification of the individual enantiomers of gamma-octalactone, gamma-nonalactone, gamma-decalactone and gamma-dodecalactone.  The enantiomeric distribution of gamma-nonalactone was investigated in 34 red wines; the (R)-stereoisomer was found to be dominant with an average of 59%, although there were wines analysed that did contain the (S)-stereoisomer in greater amounts.

Chapter 9 describes the results from the sensory studies that were completed on the individual enantiomers of the gamma-lactones.  Odour detection thresholds were measured in a red wine.  The thresholds were calculated to be 238 ug/L, 285 ug/L, 34 ug/L and 8 ug/L for the (R)-enantiomers, while the thresholds were calculated to be 135 ug/L, 91 ug/L, 47 ug/L and 39 ug/L for the (S)-enantiomers, of gamma-octalactone, gamma-nonalactone, gamma-decalactone and gamma-dodecalactone, respectively.

anaphylaxis in Australia. Whereas honeybee and wasp venom allergy can be treated by venom
immunotherapy (VIT), no such treatment is available for ant sting allergy. In addition, information on the natural history of JJA sting allergy is required to identify those most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. The main objectives of this research were to establish: (i) the prevalence, natural history and determinants of reaction severity for JJA allergy, and; (ii) the efficacy and tolerability of JJA VIT. 

Methods: A search of the Royal Hobart Hospital (RHH) forensic register, a random telephone survey, and a review of emergency department (ED) presentations were performed. Three hundred eighty-eight JJA allergic volunteers were assessed, including serum venom-specific IgE
RAST, and then followed up for accidental stings over a 4-year period. Finally, a randomised
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of JJA VIT was performed. Laboratory parameters
measured during the trial were; leukocyte stimulation index (SI), IL-4 production, IgE RAST, histamine release test (HRT), leukotriene release test (LRT) and basophil activation test (BAT). Intradermal venom skin testing (VST) was also performed at trial entry. 

Findings: The prevalence of JJA sting allergy was 2.7% in the Tasmanian population, compared to 1.4% for honeybee. People aged 35 or older had a greater risk of both sting allergy and hypotensive reactions. Four deaths were identified, all in adults with significant comorbidities. During follow-up, 79 (70%) of 113 accidental jack jumper stings caused systemic reactions. Only prior worst reaction severity predicted the severity of follow-up reactions, with the majority of people experiencing similar or less severe reactions when stung again. Sixty-eight otherwise healthy JJA allergic adult volunteers were enrolled in the clinical trial. Systemic reactions to therapy were recorded in 34% during VIT. Objectively defined systemic reactions to sting challenges arose in 1/35 after VIT (mild self-limiting urticaria only) versus 21/29 in the placebo group. Treatment with oxygen, intravenous adrenaline infusion and volume resuscitation was effective and well tolerated. Hypotension was always accompanied by a relative bradycardia, which was severe and treated with atropine in two patients. In the placebo group, only VST and HRT were predictive of sting challenge results. Although IgE RAST, leukocyte SI and IL-4 production, LRT and BAT all correlated well with VST, they did not predict sting challenge outcome. After successful VIT, venom-induced leukocyte IL-4 production tended to fall, whereas IgE RAST increased and a natural decline in HRT reactivity was reversed. 

Interpretation: VIT is highly effective in prevention of JJA sting anaphylaxis and is likely to be of most benefit to people with a history of severe systemic reactions, which usually occur in people aged over 35. Neurocardiogenic mechanisms &amp;/or direct cardiac effects may be important factors in some anaphylaxis deaths. Systemic reactions to immunotherapy are common and require immediate access to resuscitation facilities. The HRT warrants further investigation as a test for selecting those most likely to benefit from VIT. None of the tests evaluated appear to be reliable markers of successful VIT.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anaphylaxis</field><field name="subject">jack jumper ant</field><field name="subject">Myrmecia pilosula</field><field name="subject">venom allergy</field><field name="subject">venom immunotherapy</field><field name="subject">desensitisation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20050707.103356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond agency and rights: capability, migration and livelihood in Filipina experiences of domestic work in Paris and Hong Kong.</field><field name="creator">Briones, Leah</field><field name="description">More and more women from poor areas of the world are migrating to rich countries for domestic work. Given the increasing published research on their exploitation and &#145;slavery,&#146; much policy action has been oriented towards their protection as victims. Far from protecting the livelihood needs of these migrant workers, however, this victim-based approach has instead resulted in legitimising the protection of rich countries&#146; borders. An emerging perspective underscoring migrant women&#146;s agency is producing a counter-approach that fights for migrant workers&#146; rights: not as victims but as workers. Yet despite this important development in research and policy agendas, increasing inequality in the global economy and stringent immigration policies render a rights-based approach ineffective. From poor countries, and with very limited livelihood options, these migrant women choose overseas domestic work often at the expense of their human rights. As migrants, they are outsiders whose rights are superseded by the rights of the sovereign, receiving-state.  

How is it possible then, to protect the rights of these workers? This thesis employs Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum&#146;s Capability Approach to evaluate the efficacy of these women&#146;s agency in overcoming victimisation. This evaluation gives equal consideration to the victim and rights-based perspectives. It synthesises the Capability Approach with Anthony Giddens&#146; Structuration Theory in order to reconcile the polarised theories underlying the victim and rights-based perspectives - feminist structural theory and migration agency theory, respectively. In so doing, the study is able to refine the conceptualisation of agency from the highly ambiguous rights-based approach, to a more theoretically sound and feasible capability approach. The main hypothesis is that agency requires capability to successfully mediate victimisation; agency in itself is insufficient. The study draws on the experiences of Filipina overseas domestic workers in Paris and Hong Kong to test this hypothesis, and demonstrates how it is &#145;capability&#146; that can turn the &#145;slave&#146; into &#145;the worker&#146;, and protect &#145;the worker&#146; from turning into a &#145;slave.&#146;</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">Capability Approach</field><field name="subject">agency</field><field name="subject">women migrant domestic workers</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">Paris</field><field name="subject">Hong Kong</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070129.080025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparing, measuring and capturing
G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)
signalling complexes for future
development of cell-free assay technologies</field><field name="creator">Bucco, Olgatina</field><field name="description">G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins which
represent primary cellular targets for intracellular signalling. Many of these receptors
are altered in disease states and hence are the target for over 50% of marketed drugs.
Despite their physiological importance, high-throughput, cell-free assays which
measure functional or signalling activity are only recently being investigated. The
current approach by the pharmaceutical industry to initially screen compounds for
functionality is to use heterologous cell-based assay formats. The aim of this work
was to reconstitute a cell-free GPCR signalling system on an appropriate platform
(surface) as a prototype for future rapid drug screening and other applications. The
proof-of-concept approach involved using the &#239;&#191;&#189;2A-adrenergic receptor (&#239;&#191;&#189;2A-AR)
containing cell membrane preparations as the model GPCR, reconstituted with a set
of heterotrimeric G-proteins; G&#239;&#191;&#189;i1 and &#239;&#191;&#189;1&#239;&#191;&#189;2 (the signal transducing complex being
termed a &#239;&#191;&#189;transductosome&#239;&#191;&#189;). However, other receptors and G-proteins were also
investigated. Receptors were initially obtained from natural (tissue) sources, however
in the later stages they were expressed in a heterologous system (insect or
mammalian expression system). G-proteins were expressed in Spodoptera
frugiperida (Sf9) insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Receptor
expression was verified by radioligand binding assays and endogenous G-proteins
were removed from membrane preparations using the chaotropic agent urea to allow
for reconstitution with purified G-proteins. Signal transduction through the
transductosome was measured using the [35S]GTP&#239;&#191;&#189;S binding assay. Receptor
activated [35S]GTP&#239;&#191;&#189;S binding was used to determine functional reconstitution and to
validate that the system was working in the normal physiological manner both on and
off a surface (with surface attachment being via histidine attachment on the G&#239;&#191;&#189;i1
(6xHIS) subunit). Using the captured (surface-attached) transductosomes, the IC50 values for Rauwolscine, Yohimbine (potent &#239;&#191;&#189;2-AR antagonists), Prazosin (potent &#239;&#191;&#189;1-
AR antagonist) and Propranolol (&#239;&#191;&#189;-AR antagonist) displayed the appropriate rank
order for this class of receptor. This cell-free, surface-attached signalling complex
prototype may have use in the future development of drug screening and discovery
assay technologies as well as other applications as an alternative to cell-based assays
which are not readily amendable to miniaturisation, long term storage and therefore
stable robust microarray formats.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GPCR</field><field name="subject">G-protein</field><field name="subject">Assay platform</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060703.114912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MELIOIDOSIS: EPIDEMIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Allen Cheuk-Seng</field><field name="description">In under a century, melioidosis, the infection due to Burkholderia pseudomallei, has emerged from Whitmore&#146;s series of glanders-like infections amongst the morphia addicts in Burma to a major cause of mortality in northeastern Thailand and northern Australia.  Also endemic in other parts of south-east Asia, melioidosis may have varied presentations ranging from severe, overwhelming infection to chronic, low grade disease. 
Observational evidence had suggested that granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), a naturally occurring substance produced by the body in response to infection, may have been useful in reducing the high mortality associated with the more severe forms of this infection. Other observations linked the occurrence of this disease to various environmental factors, such as contamination of drinking water and the annual rainfall. This thesis explores and attempts to quantify these associations.
There are three parts to this thesis. In the first part, I reviewed the epidemiology and management of patients with melioidosis. The use of G-CSF and meropenem was associated with a fall in mortality, although other factors may have at least partially contributed to this effect. 
In the second part, I progressed towards a clinical trial of G-CSF. There was no other evidence supporting the use of G-CSF in severe sepsis and ethical issues precluded a trial in Darwin. There was not evidence from laboratory models of G-CSF action in melioidosis to support the use of G-CSF in patients, although there remained some doubt regarding the applicability of such models to human disease. I examined clinical methods to identify patients at high risk of death from melioidosis. A simple scoring system based on clinical and laboratory parameters was developed and externally validated. However, clinical definitions of severe sepsis appeared to be better predictors of mortality. A clinical trial based on clinical definitions was commenced in Thailand. 
In the final part, I explored the question of whether different strains or B. pseudomallei or different environmental conditions caused different patterns of infection. There was no evidence that strain types of this bacterium determine the pattern or severity of disease, but weather conditions appeared to influence the distribution of disease in northern Australia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">melioidosis</field><field name="subject">Burkholderia pseudomallei</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)</field><field name="subject">sepsis</field><field name="subject">drug therapy</field><field name="subject">bacterial typing techniques</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20051121.141305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Explosions in the Narrative: Action films with Lacan</field><field name="creator">Christie, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Since the late seventies, the violence, speed and spectacle associated with the genres of war films, Westerns and the spectacular melodramas of early cinema have developed into a distinct genre of its own &#150; the action film. With the development of the stylistic language at the core of this generic universe came derogatory generalisations and a tendency to categorise simplistically.  To overcome these simplifications, this thesis explores the shifts in generic language to distinguish its subtleties and complexities of logic.  Overwhelmingly the genre is considered masculine, but the purpose of this thesis is to explore the logic of this masculinity and analyse the effect of the feminine upon it.

Beginning with overviews of the theoretical attempts to grasp the concept of genre that focus primarily on the limitations of the view of their having distinct boundaries, the theory that genre theory has failed is investigated.  Leaving this view of boundaries through an exploration of symbolic universes that have translucent boundaries, the filmic movement of genre passes back and forth through the theoretical frameworks. The intention is not to analyse the overall concept of genre, but to focus on the symbolic universe and the language intrinsic to action films.  The rules of action cannot be simply transposed onto other generic categories but stand-alone.  Genre theory does not fail if approached from a perspective of discourse analysis focusing on the development of symbolic universes.  Using Jacques Lacan&#146;s theory of the four discourses, and focusing primarily on the oppositions of the Master&#146;s and the Analyst&#146;s discourse, the question moves from the listing of conventions as the markers of the boundaries of genre, to exploring why the combination of certain conventions and signifiers coming together created the genre.  

Through Lacanian discourse analysis it becomes apparent that the generally acknowledged logic of masculine and feminine are limited.  The masculine is the &#145;norm&#146; that appears to need no explanation, but the feminine has transgressed the norm and shown the construction of fantasy inherent in the genre.  This has led to post-action films that are ambiguous both in their generic structure and symbolic language.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Action films</field><field name="subject">genre</field><field name="subject">Jacques Lacan</field><field name="subject">four discourses</field><field name="subject">film genre theory</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20071121.092301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Interactions of Endophytic
Actinobacteria in Wheat and Arabidopsis</field><field name="creator">Conn, Vanessa Michelle</field><field name="description">Wheat is the most economically important crop forming one quarter of Australian farm production. The wheat industry is severely affected by diseases, with fungal pathogens causing the most important economic losses in Australia. The application of fungicides and chemicals can control crop diseases to a certain extent, however, it is expensive and public concern for the environment has led to alternative methods of disease control to be sought, including the use of microorganisms as biological control agents. Microorganisms are abundant in the soil adjacent to plant roots (rhizosphere) and within healthy plant tissue (endophytic) and a proportion possess plant growth promotion and disease resistance properties. 
Actinobacteria are gram-positive, filamentous bacteria capable of secondary metabolite production such as antibiotics and antifungal compounds. A number of the biologically active endophytes belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum were isolated in our laboratory. A number of these isolates were capable of suppressing the wheat fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium sp. and Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, both in vitro and in planta indicating the potential for the actinobacteria to be used as biocontrol agents. The aim of this research was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this plant-microbe interaction.
The indigenous microbial populations present in the rhizosphere and endophytic environment are critical to plant health and disruptions of these populations are detrimental. The culture-independent technique Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) was used to characterise the endophytic actinobacteria population of wheat roots under different conditions. Soils which support a higher number of indigenous microorganisms result in wheat roots with higher endophytic actinobacterial diversity and level of colonisation. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene clones, obtained using the same actinobacteria-biased PCR primers that were used in the T-RFLP analysis, confirmed the presence of the actinobacterial diversity, and identified a number of Mycobacterium and Streptomyces species. It was found that the endophytic actinobacterial population of the wheat plants contained a higher diversity of endophytic actinobacteria than reported previously, and that this diversity varied significantly among different field soils.
The endophytic actinobacteria have previously been shown to protect wheat from disease and enhance growth when coated onto the seed before sowing. As the endophytes isolated were recognised as potential biocontrol agents, the impact on the indigenous endophytic microbial population was investigated. Utilising the T-RFLP technique it was established that the use of a commercial microbial inoculant, containing a large number of soil bacterial and fungal strains applied to the soil, disrupts the indigenous endophyte population present in the wheat roots. The hypothesis is that non-indigenous microbes proliferate and dominate in the soil preventing a number of endophytic-competent actinobacterial genera from access to the seed and ultimately endophytic colonisation of the wheat roots. This dramatically reduces diversity of endophytes and level of colonisation. In contrast the use of a single endophytic actinobacteria endophyte inoculant results in a 3-fold increase in colonisation by the added inoculant, but does not significantly affect this indigenous population.
Colonisation of healthy plant tissues with fungal endophytes has been shown to improve the competitive fitness with enhanced tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress and improved resistance to pathogens and herbivores. In this study the fungal endophyte population of wheat plants grown in four different soils was analysed using partial sequencing of 18S rRNA gene sequences. Sequence anlaysis of clones revealed a diverse range of fungal endophytes. In this diverse range of fungal endophytes a number sequences were highly similar to those of previously known fungal phytopathogens. A number of sequences detected were similar to fungal species previously identified in soil or plant material but not as endophytes. The remaining sequences were similar to fungal species without a known relationship with plants.
Plants have developed an inducible mechanism of defence against pathogens. In addition to local responses plants have developed a mechanism to protect uninfected tissue through a signal that spreads systemically inducing changes in gene expression. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana activation of the Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) pathway and the Jasmonate (JA)/Ethylene (ET) pathway is characterised by the production of pathogenesis-related (PR) and antimicrobial proteins resulting in systemic pathogen resistance. Endophytic actinobacteria, isolated from healthy wheat roots in our laboratory, have been shown to enhance disease resistance to multiple pathogens in wheat when coated onto the seed before sowing. Real Time RT-PCR was used to determine if key genes in the SAR and JA/ET pathways were induced in response to inoculation with endophytic actinobacteria.
Inoculation of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana with selected strains of endophytic actinobacteria was able to &#239;&#191;&#189;prime&#239;&#191;&#189; the defence pathways by inducing low level expression of SAR and JA/ET genes. Upon pathogen infection the defence-genes are strongly up-regulated and the endophyte coated plants had significantly higher expression of these genes compared to un-inoculated plants. Resistance to the bacterial pathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora was mediated by the JA/ET pathway whereas the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum triggered primarily the SAR pathway. 
Further analysis of the endophytic actinobacteria-mediated resistance was performed using the Streptomyces sp. EN27 and Arabidopsis defence-compromised mutants. It was found that resistance to E. carotovora subsp. carotovora mediated by Streptomyces sp. EN27 occurred via a NPR1-independent pathway and required salicylic acid whereas the jasmonic acid and ethylene signalling molecules were not essential. In contrast resistance to F. oxysporum mediated by Streptomyces sp. EN27 occurred via a NPR1-dependent pathway but also required salicylic acid and was JA- and ET-independent.

In coastal waters there can be an increased risk of infection to humans due to the possible re-suspension of these microorganisms during recreational activities. This research attempts to more accurately identify environmental exposure in the first stage of a health risk assessment in recreational coastal waters. Techniques were developed to successfully separate microorganisms from sediment particles. Of the methods investigated, subjecting diluted sediment samples to a sonication bath for 10 minutes was found to be the most efficient separation technique over a range of sediment types. This method was therefore used in the subsequent studies to enumerate organisms from the surface sediment layer, as distinct from the water column. Faecal coliforms were enumerated by membrane filtration in both water and sediment from three Adelaide metropolitan recreational coastal sites, chosen to represent different physical sediment characteristics, over a 12-month period. All sites investigated met current National Health and Medical Research Council Guidelines for primary contact recreation. Faecal coliform concentrations were generally greater in sediment compared with overlying water for all samples. This was most evident in sediment consisting of greater silt/clay and organic carbon content (with up to 1000 times higher concentrations in the surface sediment layer compared with overlying water). For coastal recreational sites impacted by stormwater or river discharges, high faecal coliform concentrations were found to be associated with rainfall. A laboratory-based microcosm study utilising intact sediment cores was undertaken to determine the decay rates of faecal indicator organisms (E. coli, enterococci and somatic coliphage) and pathogens (Salmonella derby and S. typhimurium) in both overlying water and in various sediment types. For all organisms tested, temperature had an inverse relationship with survival. Greater decay was observed in the overlying water compared to the surface sediment layer. Small particle size and high organic carbon content was found to be more conducive to microbial survival. In general, decay rates of E. coli were significantly greater than enterococci and coliphage. Although no significant correlations were observed between decay rates of the pathogens and indicator organisms, decay of Salmonella spp. in overlying water more closely resembled that of E. coli than that of other indicators. Using decay rates measured in the microcosm study and available dose-response data, a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) utilising Monte Carlo simulation was undertaken to estimate the risk of infection to Salmonella spp. and rotavirus following exposure to recreational coastal water subject to a range of faecal contamination levels. For modelling purposes, the assumption was made that rotavirus decay was equivalent to coliphage decay. The probability of infection from rotavirus due to exposure to contaminated recreational coastal water was greater than that for Salmonella spp. under all scenarios. This increased probability of infection is linked to the high infectivity of rotavirus compared to Salmonella spp. Results of this research highlight the limited effectiveness of using prescribed faecal coliform concentrations in the water column alone to estimate the risk of exposure to pathogenic microorganisms during recreational activity at coastal areas. It demonstrated that coastal sediments act as a reservoir for both indicator and pathogenic organisms released into the coastal environment. This suggests an increased exposure risk if these organisms are resuspended back into the water column during recreational activity. A combined risk-based monitoring program would provide a more robust and reliable estimate of health risk associated with coastal recreational areas.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microcosm</field><field name="subject">recreational waters</field><field name="subject">coastal waters</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20051108.093750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomimetic Approaches to the Synthesis of Polyketide Derived Marine Natural Products; (-)-Maurenone and the Spiculoic Acids</field><field name="creator">Crossman, Julia Stephanie</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the total synthesis of the polyketide derived marine natural product (-)-maurenone (14) and synthetic studies of a model system for the marine polyketides, the spiculoic acids (20, 22-24). A biomimetic approach involving cyclisation of linear polyketide precursors to install the complex chemical frameworks was employed. 
 

Maurenone is a polypropionate derived metabolite isolated from pulmonate molluscs collected off the coast of Costa Rica. While structural assignment following isolation revealed a relatively uncommon tetra-substituted dihydropyrone moiety the only stereochemical information deduced was the trans-relative relationship between the C8 and C9 protons. The total synthesis of a series of eight stereoisomeric putative structures was achieved in order to assign the stereochemistry of (-)-maurenone (14), as that depicted above. A time and cost efficient strategy was developed utilising common intermediates providing access to the eight stereoisomeric structures in a convergent manner. Six key fragments, four aldehydes (109) and two ketones (110), were synthesised using highly diastereoselective syn- and anti-boron aldol reactions and were coupled using a lithium-mediated aldol reaction. Trifluoroacetic acid-promoted cyclisation/dehydration enabled installation the &#131;&#215;-dihydropyrone ring. All eight isomers of one enantiomeric series were synthesised by coupling two ketones with each of four aldehydes. By comparison of the NMR data for the eight isomers with that reported for the natural product, the relative stereochemistry was established as shown. The (-)-enantiomer of maurenone was synthesised in nine linear steps (13 % overall yield) from (R)-2-benzylpentan-3-one ((R)-40) and (R)-2-benzoyloxypentan-3-one ((R)-39).

 

The spiculoic acid family of polyketide derived natural products, isolated from plakortis sponges, possess a unique [4.3.0]-bicyclic core which is proposed to be formed via an enzyme catalysed Intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA) cycloaddition reaction of linear polyene precursors 25. Model linear precursors (114), possessing various olefin geometries at C2 and both stereochemical orientations of the C5 stereocentre, were synthesised in order to examine stereoselectivity of the thermally induced IMDA cycloaddition reaction. 
 
The two alternative C4-C6 stereotriads of the linear precursors 114 were achieved by employing highly diastereoselective substrate-controlled aldol reactions; an anti-boron aldol reaction, controlled by the facial preference of (R)-2-benzoyloxypentan-3-one ((R)-39), and a syn-titanium aldol reaction, under the control of chiral N-acylthiazolidinethione ((R)-43a). The diene and dienophile moieties were installed using either standard Wittig, H.W.E. or &#161;&#167;modified&#161;&#168; Julia olefination reactions. 
 
A thorough stereochemical assignment of the cycloadducts of the thermally induced IMDA reaction of each linear precursor was accomplished employing 2D NMR techniques. Comparison of the stereochemistry of each of the cycloadducts with the spiculoic acids revealed that the linear precursor (2E,5S)-114 produced a cycloadduct 232 with stereochemistry analogous to the natural products in 94 % diastereoselectivity. Thus, a synthetic approach to the spiculoic acids via synthesis of a linear precursor 285 possessing a TBS ether at C5 in the S configuration was proposed. Unfortunately, problems encountered in the synthesis of the proposed linear precursors to the spiculoic acids ultimately prevented the total synthesis from being achieved.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stereoselective synthesis</field><field name="subject">total synthesis</field><field name="subject">Diels-Alder Reaction</field><field name="subject">Aldol Reaction</field><field name="subject">marine natural products</field><field name="subject">biomimetic synthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080212.134949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of growth factors on T-lymphocyte induced keratinocyte apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Daehn, Ilse Sofia</field><field name="description">Atopic eczema is a T-lymphocyte mediated chronic inflammatory skin disorder. The
interaction of CD4+ T-lymphocytes with epidermal keratinocytes results in
dysregulated, chronic inflammation and altered barrier function. T-lymphocyte induced
keratinocyte apoptosis has been proposed as a mechanism by which epidermal integrity
is impaired in eczema. Apoptosis of keratinocytes is thought to result from Tlymphocyte
associated Fas ligand (FasL) binding to the death receptor Fas on
keratinocytes. The primary aim of this project was to characterize the induction of
keratinocyte apoptosis by T-lymphocytes and address the hypothesis that insulin-like
growth factor-I (IGF-1), transforming growth factor [beta]1 (TGF[beta]1) and a milk derived
growth factor extract containing TGF[beta] and IGF-I (whey growth factor extract; WGFE)
protect keratinocytes from T-lymphocyte mediated apoptosis.

To address the aims of this project, an in vitro co-culture model was developed combining T-lymphocytes with keratinocytes. Co-cultures were initially established using human Jurkat T-lymphocytes and human HaCaT keratinocytes with more extensive characterisation undertaken using primary CD4+ T-lymphocytes together with HaCaTs or normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). Annexin V and propidium iodide staining was established as the primary method for measuring keratinocyte apoptosis with this validated using sodium butyrate a known inducer of apoptosis. Changes in nuclear fragmentation and cell morphology were also examined as a key feature of apoptosis. The involvement of the Fas pathway was investigated by assessing T-lymphocyte FasL expression, keratinocyte Fas expression and downstream caspase activation. Inflammatory cytokines IFN[gamma] and TNF[alpha] were also examined due to their ability to induce Fas expression.

Studies performed with T-lymphocytes demonstrated that keratinocyte apoptosis was induced, with this due primarily to direct T-lymphocytes and keratinocytes interactions, rather than soluble mediators in the co-culture milieu. Activated T-lymphocytes were found to have high levels of FasL and to upregulate keratinocyte Fas expression. The increased keratinocyte Fas was associated with increased IFN[gamma] levels in the co-culture media and activation of the caspase cascade. A Fas blocking antibody prevented T-lymphocyte induced keratinocyte apoptosis demonstrating that this was a Fas dependent event.  

As the primary function of keratinocytes is to terminally differentiate, the differentiation status of the cells induced to undergo apoptosis was examined. It was demonstrated that T-lymphocytes decrease the intensity of ?6 integrin expression by the keratinocytes. This marker identifies undifferentiated basal cells as high expressors of [alpha]6, with cells in the early stages of differentiation pathway found to be low expressors of [alpha]6. Co-staining with Annexin V demonstrated that the apoptotic keratinocytes were low expressors of [alpha]6 and thus cells committed to the early stages of differentiation. This suggested that the T-lymphocytes initiated the onset of keratinocyte terminal differentiation with this linked to the cells being more susceptible to death induced by T-lymphocyte by activation of the Fas pathway. 

The ability of TGF[beta]1, IGF-I and WGFE to inhibit T-lymphocyte induced keratinocyte apoptosis was examined. A combination of recombinant TGF[beta] (10ng) &amp; IGF-I (100ng) was able to significantly inhibit keratinocyte apoptosis. A similar result was obtained with WGFE, and although these growth factor treatments were able to reduce the elevated IFN[gamma] levels in the co-culture media, they did not reduce T-lymphocyte induced Fas upregulation. The TGF?1 and IGF-I combination as well as WGFE did however prevent the T-lymphocyte induced shift from [alpha]6 bright to dim expressing keratinocytes. As such, the growth factor combinations appeared to protect the keratinocytes from T-lymphocyte mediated apoptosis by preventing them from committing to terminal differentiation. 

The studies in this thesis have characterised the Fas associated mechanisms by which T-lymphocytes induce keratinocyte apoptosis and suggest specific growth factor combinations may have the potential to ameliorate the reduced barrier function associated with inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic eczema.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">keratinocyte</field><field name="subject">apoptosis</field><field name="subject">eczema</field><field name="subject">growth factors</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20071215.233705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bullying, Victimisation, Self-Esteem, and Narcissism in Adolescents</field><field name="creator">Daly, Anthony Leslie</field><field name="description">OBJECTIVES: The general aim of this research was to analyse the relationships between bullying (as a distinct form of aggression), victimisation, personal and collective self-esteem, and narcissism in adolescents. Baumeister et al. (1996) refuted the conventionally accepted view that low self-esteem is a cause of violence whereby, for example, those who lack self-esteem may use aggression as a means of dominating others and thereby gaining self-esteem. Instead, it may be that aggression is related to high self-esteem such that individuals with a combination of high levels of both self-esteem and narcissism are more likely to react aggressively to a perceived threat. Design: After a conducting a small pilot study (n = 112), the main study employed a large-scale cross-sectional survey with self-report questionnaires administered to school students during class. METHODS: Participants were drawn from six metropolitan high schools in Adelaide (South Australia), resulting in 1,628 adolescents (665 females &amp; 963 males, aged 12-17 years) completing the survey. The questionnaire battery comprised modified self-report bully and victim versions of the Direct and Indirect Aggression Scales (Bjorkqvist et al., 1992), personal (Rosenberg, 1979) and collective self-esteem (Luhtanen &amp; Crocker, 1992) scales, the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (Raskin &amp; Hall, 1981), and a measure of socially desirable responding (i.e., Impression Management; Paulhus, 1991). RESULTS: A variety of multivariate analyses controlling for socially desirable responses was employed to test and explore hypothesised relationships. Results showed no relationship between age and any form of bullying or victimisation. Boys reported significantly higher mean levels of direct and total bullying and victimisation, whereas girls reported higher levels of indirect bullying and victimisation. Victimisation was negatively correlated with personal self-esteem, and positively correlated with collective self-esteem. In contrast, bullying was positively correlated with personal self-esteem, with no significant relationship found with collective self-esteem. Collective and personal self-esteem did not differentially predict different types of bullying or victimisation. Narcissism was positively correlated with bullying. The predicted interaction between personal self-esteem, narcissism and bullying was evident, although the predicted collective self-esteem interaction was not found. Impression Management (social desirability) was significantly negatively correlated with bullying and, to a lesser extent, with victimisation. CONCLUSION: Research such as this into the possible causes and correlates of aggression and bullying will assist in the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective interventions. For example, as results corresponded with Baumeister et al.'s (1996) assertion in that bullying was related to high self-esteem, interventions that are designed to increase self-esteem might in reality be counterproductive and possibly contribute to an increase in bullying behaviour. Additionally, victims reported higher collective self-esteem than their non-victimised peers, clearly a novel finding worthy of further research. Findings suggested that, rather than running the risk of underreporting of socially undesirable behaviours, self-report methods provide a useful and valid means of measuring prevalence rates and internal states. Rather than underreporting aggressive behaviours, it is likely that respondents were being honest as they did not feel that these behaviours were, in fact, socially undesirable. The present sample reported bullying and victimisation prevalence rates that were comparatively high, despite using relatively conservative criteria, possibly due to an increased awareness of what constitutes bullying as a result of government and school anti-bullying policies and initiatives. The findings generally correspond with and build upon previous research. In addition, a number of the results are novel, providing numerous opportunities for future researchers to further explore and test the relationships between self-esteem, bullying, and victimisation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adolescent</field><field name="subject">bullying</field><field name="subject">victimisation</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="subject">collective self-esteem</field><field name="subject">impression management</field><field name="subject">socially desirable responding</field><field name="subject">gender differences</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20061130.193920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behind Open Doors - A Construct of Nursing Practice in an Australian Residential Aged Care Facility</field><field name="creator">De Bellis, Anita Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis explored the relationship between the discourses of nursing care, the nursing care provision, and the perceived nursing care needs of three highly dependent residents in a residential aged care facility in Australia. Residential aged care in this country has undergone major reforms since 1987 and the nursing profession has struggled with these changes because of the documentation, validation, and accreditation requirements; the inadequate determination of dependency on nursing care for funding; the Registered Nurse (RN) being removed from the bedside to a role of scribe and delegator; the increasing acuity and complexity of the residents' needs; an increase in the turnover of residents; a rise in the nursing staff attrition rate; the delivery of care by untrained and unqualified persons; the RN being accountable and responsible for the care given by 'non-nurses' from a distance; and, the inadequate skill mix and staff to resident ratios provided in these institutions. The interest of this thesis was to research gerontological nursing practice in the context of residential aged care.

Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs) in Australia that care for the highly dependent elderly were identified in the thesis as disciplinary institutions that used 'subjectivation' as a means to control the efficiency and effectiveness of the labour force and the 'docile' bodies of the residents, whilst at the same time the government rhetoric is that of the quality of life standards and the rights of residents in these institutions. As well as the discourse analysis, an historical overview of the aged care reforms in Australia was undertaken for the period from 1975 to 2006 that demonstrated the effects the reforms have had on the voice of nurses and nursing care in these institutions. This analysis highlighted where nurses have been silenced and found the federal government determining what is nursing care and what is not nursing care, and also who is providing this nursing care. 

Using a case study approach and discourse analysis each of the three residents was studied using data from five sources namely the resident or relative, a RN, a careworker (CW), the current documentation pertaining to the resident's nursing care, and the non-participant observation of the nursing care provided. These discourses on the nursing care and perceived residents' nursing care needs were analysed using the theoretical base developed from the philosophy and research interest of Michel Foucault (1926-1984), who questioned the apparatus and institutions of Western cultures and searched for discontinuities in the practices of what he termed 'disciplines'. 

The results of the discourse analysis found nursing care practices that were alarming around the residents' perceived nursing care needs, the documentation of the nursing care provision, and the observed 'actual' nursing care provided. A questionable standard of nursing care was evidenced even though this facility had recently been accredited. A custodial level of mechanistic care was provided to residents in an extremely noisy and public environment within a culture of haste and bustle by unknowledgeable CWs, under the distant gaze of a RN, and the direction of the government documentation requirements. This resulted in unsafe, unethical, unprofessional, and negligent practices, as well as fraudulent, illegal, and dangerously out of date documentation practices. This was ultimately affecting each resident's quality of life, nursing care, and wellbeing and was an added burden on the residents' relatives. Many discontinuities, dissonances, conflicts, and contradictions in nursing practice were uncovered for these three highly dependent residents that may be transferable and similar to other highly dependent residents in this and other institutions. Indeed it may mirror other disciplines that provide care services, such as mental health care, acute care, and disability care provision.

The concerns for the nursing profession have epistemological, ethical, and political ramifications for the residents and their relatives, the nurses, the non-nurses doing nursing work, the government, and the industry. Epistemologically new nursing 'knowledges' were being developed that were not resident focussed or based on evidence. Ethically, the legislated rights of residents were not being supported, despite the accreditation, funding, and complaint mechanisms in place - and this has the potential to have punitive ramifications for the industry. Professionally and politically, CWs were identified as non-nurses doing nursing work of a poor standard. This care was not based on accepted nursing practice, but developed through the documentation requirements of the federal government department, the applied constraints, and the CWs themselves. Furthermore, the documentation requirements were found to be a pretence in regard to funding through validation and accreditation, as well as a charade in nursing practice. 

There is presently a substantial third level of nurses who are identified legally and political as non-nurses doing non-nursing work (known as 'personal' care); but these non-nurses are doing nursing work and are identified by the nursing profession and the public as 'nurses' doing nursing work. These non-nurses who provided nursing care are not educated, licensed, or regulated, and are not accountable professionally to nurses or legally to the public. It is proposed that CWs are in need of licensing under nurses' boards requiring at the very least a minimum of training and education. It is further proposed that documentation requirements resort back to professional nursing documentation; funding be dependent on an predetermined minimum skill mix and staff/resident ratio; and the funding of residents be based on a minimum data set and untied from nursing practice. The professional nursing practice of assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation of nursing care needs resorting to a nursing domain of knowledge, practice, accountability, responsibility, and documentation.

If an acceptable quality of life is to be realised for residents in the residential aged care system, given that highly dependent residents are reliant on quality nursing care that is fundamentally imperative to their very quantity and quality of life, then changes in the residential aged care system and the nursing profession will be necessary. This thesis will contribute to opening up such dialogue between the government, the industry, and the nursing profession in Australia, and it also highlights areas of aged care nursing practice in need of further research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aged care</field><field name="subject">nursing practice</field><field name="subject">quality of nursing care</field><field name="subject">aged care policy</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20061107.122002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinematics and Heat Budget of the Leeuwin Current</field><field name="creator">Domingues, Catia Motta</field><field name="description">This study investigates the upper ocean circulation along the west Australian coast, based
on recent observations (WOCE ICM6, 1994/96) and numerical output from the 1/6 degree Parallel Ocean
Program model (POP11B 1993/97). Particularly, we identify the source regions of the Leeuwin
Current, quantify its mean and seasonal variability in terms of volume, heat and salt transports,
and examine its heat balance (cooling mechanism). This also leads to further understanding of the
regional circulation associated with the Leeuwin Undercurrent, the Eastern Gyral Current and the
southeast Indian Subtropical Gyre.
The tropical and subtropical sources of the Leeuwin Current are understood from an
online numerical particle tracking. Some of the new findings are the Tropical Indian Ocean source
of the Leeuwin Current (in addition to the Indonesian Throughflow/Pacific); the Eastern Gyral
Current as a recirculation of the South Equatorial Current; the subtropical source of the Leeuwin
Current fed by relatively narrow subsurface-intensified eastward jets in the Subtropical Gyre, which
are also a major source for the Subtropical Water (salinity maximum) as observed in the Leeuwin
Undercurrent along the ICM6 section at 22 degrees S.
The ICM6 current meter array reveals a rich vertical current structure near North West
Cape (22 degrees S). The coastal part of the Leeuwin Current has dominant synoptic variability and
occasionally contains large spikes in its transport time series arising from the passage of tropical
cyclones. On the mean, it is weaker and shallower compared to further downstream, and it only
transports Tropical Water, of a variable content. The Leeuwin Undercurrent carries Subtropical
Water, South Indian Central Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water equatorward between
150/250 to 500/750 m. There is a poleward flow just below the undercurrent which advects a
mixed Intermediate Water, partially associated with outflows from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf.
Narrow bottom-intensified currents are also observed.
The 5-year mean model Leeuwin Current is a year-round poleward flow between 22 degrees S and
34 degrees S. It progressively deepens, from 150 to 300 m depth. Latitudinal variations in its volume
transport are a response to lateral inflows/outflows. It has double the transport at 34 degrees S (-2.2 Sv)
compared to at 22 degrees S (-1.2 Sv). These model estimates, however, may underestimate the transport
of the Leeuwin Current by 50%. Along its path, the current becomes cooler (6 degrees C), saltier (0.6 psu)
and denser (2 kg m -3). At seasonal scales, a stronger poleward flow in May-June advects the
warmest and freshest waters along the west Australian coast. This advection is apparently spun up
by the arrival of a poleward Kelvin wave in April, and reinforced by a minimum in the equatorward
wind stress during July.
In the model heat balance, the Leeuwin Current is significantly cooled by the eddy heat
flux divergence (4 degrees C out of 6 degrees C), associated with mechanisms operating at submonthly time scales.
However, exactly which mechanisms it is not yet clear. Air-sea fluxes only account for ~30% of the
cooling and seasonal rectification is negligible. The eddy heat divergence, originating over a narrow
region along the outer edge of the Leeuwin Current, is responsible for a considerable warming of a
vast area of the adjacent ocean interior, which is then associated with strong heat losses to the
atmosphere. The model westward eddy heat flux estimates are considerably larger than those
associated with long lived warm core eddies detaching from the Leeuwin Current and moving
offshore. This suggests that these mesoscale features are not the main mechanism responsible for
the cooling of the Leeuwin Current. We suspect instead that short lived warm core eddies might
play an important role.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leeuwin Current</field><field name="subject">Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">ocean circulation</field><field name="subject">eastern boundary current</field><field name="subject">current variability</field><field name="subject">seasonal cycle</field><field name="subject">water mass</field><field name="subject">water property</field><field name="subject">transport</field><field name="subject">heat balance</field><field name="subject">eddy heat flux</field><field name="subject">POP model</field><field name="subject">WOCE ICM6</field><field name="subject">Lagrangian particle tracking</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060612.211358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer Aided Long-Bone Segmentation and Fracture Detection</field><field name="creator">Donnelley, Martin</field><field name="description">Medical imaging has advanced at a tremendous rate since x-rays were discovered in 1895. Today, x-ray machines produce extremely high-quality images for radiologists to interpret. However, the methods of interpretation have only recently begun to be augmented by advances in computer technology. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems that guide healthcare professionals to making the correct diagnosis are slowly becoming more prevalent throughout the medical field.

Bone fractures are a relatively common occurrence. In most developed countries the number of fractures associated with age-related bone loss is increasing rapidly. Regardless of the treating physician's level of experience, accurate detection and evaluation of musculoskeletal trauma is often problematic. Each year, the presence of many fractures is missed during x-ray diagnosis. For a trauma patient, a mis-diagnosis can lead to ineffective patient management, increased dissatisfaction, and expensive litigation. As a result, detection of long-bone fractures is an important orthopaedic and radiologic problem, and it is proposed that a novel CAD system could help lower the miss rate. This thesis examines the development of such a system, for the detection of long-bone fractures. 

A number of image processing software algorithms useful for automating the fracture detection process have been created. The first algorithm is a non-linear scale-space smoothing technique that allows edge information to be extracted from the x-ray image. The degree of smoothing is controlled by the scale parameter, and allows the amount of image detail that should be retained to be adjusted for each stage of the analysis. The result is demonstrated to be superior to the Canny edge detection algorithm. The second utilises the edge information to determine a set of parameters that approximate the shaft of the long-bone. This is achieved using a modified Hough Transform, and specially designed peak and line endpoint detectors.

The third stage uses the shaft approximation data to locate the bone centre-lines and then perform diaphysis segmentation to separate the diaphysis from the epiphyses. Two segmentation algorithms are presented and one is shown to not only produce better results, but also be suitable for application to all long-bone images. The final stage applies a gradient based fracture detection algorithm to the segmented regions. This algorithm utilises a tool called the gradient composite measure to identify abnormal regions, including fractures, within the image. These regions are then identified and highlighted if they are deemed to be part of a fracture.

A database of fracture images from trauma patients was collected from the emergency department at the Flinders Medical Centre. From this complete set of images, a development set and test set were created. Experiments on the test set show that diaphysis segmentation and fracture detection are both performed with an accuracy of 83%. Therefore these tools can consistently identify the boundaries between the bone segments, and then accurately highlight midshaft long-bone fractures within the marked diaphysis.

Two of the algorithms---the non-linear smoothing and Hough Transform---are relatively slow to compute. Methods of decreasing the diagnosis time were investigated, and a set of parallelised algorithms were designed. These algorithms significantly reduced the total calculation time, making use of the algorithm much more feasible.

The thesis concludes with an outline of future research and proposed techniques that---along with the methods and results presented---will improve CAD systems for fracture detection, resulting in more accurate diagnosis of fractures, and a reduction of the fracture miss rate.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medical Imaging</field><field name="subject">Computer Aided Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Edge Detection</field><field name="subject">AMSS</field><field name="subject">Hough Transform</field><field name="subject">Bone</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080115.222927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Courage and Truthfulness:  Ethical Strategies and the Creative Process in the Novels of Iris Murdoch, Doris Lessing and V.S.

Naipaul are studied in the light of statements they have made in essays and interviews regarding the ethical implications of writing fiction.  The purpose of this research is to examine the nature of the problems they have identified in the creative process of writing and the strategies each has used to address the ethical problems they perceive, and to assess the relative success of their chosen methods.
It can be seen that, although for each of them the quest for truth is their highest concern, they have each developed very different ways of dealing with the problems they believe are connected with writing truthfully, and in addition, they have defined the particulars of these problems in different ways.  It is concluded that the more carefully examined and individually defined these problems are, the greater the internal consistency and credibility which is achieved by the strategies they have developed to address the problems, and the more their work has developed in the course of their careers.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ethics in literature</field><field name="subject">Iris Murdoch</field><field name="subject">Doris Lessing</field><field name="subject">VS Naipaul</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20050530.150240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Health Professionals in the Prevention of Smoking- and Alcohol-Related Harms: Application of the Theory of Planned Behaviour to Work Behaviours</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Toby</field><field name="description">Professional practice change and the transfer of research into practice are critical issues for the public health field. The program of research presented here investigated the potential for practice change in dental hygienists&#146; and Emergency Department nurses&#146; provision of brief interventions targeting smoking (of tobacco) and alcohol consumption respectively. Smoking and risky alcohol consumption are two high prevalence public health issues that have a substantial impact on the burden of death and illness in Australia.

Research on dental hygienists&#146; and nurses&#146; uptake of these interventions is limited and has largely focused on descriptions of perceived barriers. Little research has been conducted on the attitudes and motivations of health professionals to engage in these interventions. The present research was designed to address that gap. Specifically, two behaviours by dental hygienists and Emergency Department nurses were investigated: identification of patients at risk and provision of assistance to such patients.
The program of research applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour to these behaviours in order to:
1) examine the role of dental hygienists and Emergency Department nurses in the provision of brief interventions for smoking and alcohol consumption respectively,
2) assess the ability of the Theory of Planned Behaviour to understand and predict health professionals&#146; identifying and assisting behaviour,
3) assess the ability of the theory to account for the influence of organisational factors on workers&#146; behaviour, and
4) design and evaluate a Theory of Planned Behaviour-based professional practice change intervention.

This is the first research to apply the Theory of Planned Behaviour to these behaviours, to examine the potential of the theory to account for the influence of organisational factors on workers&#146; behaviour, and to trial an intervention targeting behaviour in an organisational setting.

The four studies undertaken provided a comprehensive application of the Theory of Planned Behaviour.

In the first study, a meta-analysis of published research examined the ability of the Theory of Planned Behaviour to predict behaviours in an organisational setting. This was the first meta-analysis of studies applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour applications to organisational settings. The findings were comparable to results of a meta-analysis of studies applying the theory to social and health behaviours, supporting the application of the theory to the organisational setting, and also highlighted the potential importance of perceived behavioural control for work behaviours. Studies 2 to 4 were designed to follow Ajzen and Fishbein&#146;s (1975) 3-step methodology for applying the theory.

In Study 2, the behavioural, normative, and control beliefs held by dental hygienists and Emergency Department nurses, and potentially relevant organisational factors, such as workload and available support, were identified through in-depth qualitative interviews.

Study 3 measured the ability of the Theory of Planned Behaviour to predict dental hygienists&#146; and Emergency Department nurses&#146; frequency of identifying and assisting. The theory was most successful in predicting dental hygienists&#146; frequency of assisting patients who smoke. The self-efficacy dimension of perceived behavioural control was the strongest predictor of this behaviour. The findings for Emergency Department nurses indicated that subjective norms were an important predictor of intentions to identify and assist patients. The Theory of Planned Behaviour accounted for the influence of organisational factors on behaviour for both dental hygienists and nurses.

Study 4 involved a randomised controlled trial which evaluated a professional intervention targeting dental hygienists&#146; assistance of patients who smoke. Trends indicated potential benefits of the intervention, but overall no significant changes in dental hygienists&#146; role adequacy, role legitimacy, and targeted control beliefs emerged. This outcome was attributed to ceiling effects and the influence of a media campaign that coincided with the intervention.

The research presented here provides partial support for the application of the Theory of Planned Behaviour to professional practice change efforts. Specifically, the ability of the theory to explain the impact of organisational factors and identify variables most predictive of behaviour may provide valuable insight for prioritising future professional practice change efforts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tobacco</field><field name="subject">brief intervention</field><field name="subject">dentistry</field><field name="subject">oral health</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">accident and emergency</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070703.133715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FAMILY-FOCUSED MANAGEMENT OF OVERWEIGHT IN PRE-PUBERTAL CHILDREN &#150; A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL</field><field name="creator">Golley, Rebecca Kirsty</field><field name="description">Over a quarter of children and two thirds of adults in Australia are overweight, with these estimates reflecting global trends.  The literature review in Chapter 1 highlights that treatment of childhood overweight is an important part of the public health approach required to address the obesity epidemic.  Energy moderation, behaviour modification and family support are the cornerstones of treatment of childhood overweight.  However the evidence to guide best practice is limited, with a call being made for well designed studies to inform age-appropriate effective, long term child weight management.  Studies are needed in a range of populations and to assess a range of health outcomes.  This thesis tested the hypothesis that, pre-pubertal children whose parents participate in a parent-led, family-focused child weight management intervention comprising parent skills training and intensive lifestyle education will have adiposity, metabolic profiles and indicators of physical and psychosocial functioning after 12 months that are a) improved compared to children wait listed for intervention and b) no different to children whose parents participate in parenting skills training alone (without intensive lifestyle education).  

Methods of the randomised controlled trial undertaken with 111 overweight, pre-pubertal 6-9 year olds to test this hypothesis are detailed in Chapter 2.  Parents were defined as the agents of change, responsible for attending intervention sessions and implementing family-focused lifestyle change to support child weight management.  Two interventions, both utilising parenting skills training, but differing in the presence or absence of intensive lifestyle eduction were compared to a group waitlisted for intervention with a brief pamphlet.  Program effectiveness was defined in terms of adiposity together with broader health and evaluation outcomes.  

 
Chapter 3 describes the study population, their flow through the study, the primary outcome BMI z score and waist circumference z score.  With parenting plus intensive lifestyle education there was a 10% reduction in BMI z score over 12 months.  However this was not statistically different to the 5% reduction observed with parenting alone or intervention waitlisting.  There was a significant reduction in waist circumference between baseline and 12 months with parenting alone and parenting plus lifestyle education, but not waitlisting.  There was a group, time and gender interaction, with boys receiving intervention having greater reductions in adiposity.  In determining intervention effectiveness, growth, metabolic profile and psychosocial outcomes are presented in Chapter 4.  While there were limited improvements in metabolic profile and body dissatisfaction, significant improvements were observed in parent-perceived HR-QOL relating to psychosocial and family functioning.  Improvements were confined to the intervention groups, parenting plus lifestyle education more than parenting alone.  Chapter 5 presents the study process and impact evaluation.  Parents were satisfied with the program and reported that it provided the type of help they wanted.  Personal, rather than program factors such as work and family commitments limited intervention attendance to 60%.  Child health behaviours and parental weight status show positive change in all groups, but favour intervention.  Chapter 6 highlights key findings, study strengths/limitations and areas for further research.  In conclusion, a parent-led family-focused intervention utilising parenting skills training and healthy family lifestyle is a promising intervention for young overweight children.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child weight management</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">parenting skills</field><field name="subject">healthy lifestyle</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20061018.021848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN INVESTIGATION OF FACTORS THAT DETERMINE
SELF-REPORTED KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES,
AND CLINICAL BEHAVIOURS OF PRACTISING
REGISTERED NURSES TOWARDS PEOPLE WITH
ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND OTHER DRUG-RELATED
PROBLEMS</field><field name="creator">Goodin, William John</field><field name="description">There is an enduring and prevailing disparity between the clinical prevalence of
alcohol, tobacco and other drug-related problems and the frequency that nurses
recognise and intervene in these common problems. The extant nursing literature has
long determined an urgent need for further investigation into why nurses do not
respond to patients with ATOD-related problems in the consistent and effective
manner that the prevalence of these costly health problems require, or in a manner that
reflects the opportunities that nurses have to offer brief and timely intervention.
This thesis reports and discusses the investigation of factors that determine
identification, assessment and interventions of patients with alcohol, tobacco and
other drug-related problems by a randomly selected sample of Registered Nurses
[n=1281] in practice in New South Wales, Australia. Of particular interest was the
relationship between nurses' ATOD knowledge, therapeutic attitudes and clinical
activity.
Multiple quantitative and qualitative methods were used, firstly to systematically
investigate factors within the nurse and their clinical setting that might predict desired
clinical behaviour towards addressing ATOD-related problems, and secondly, to
analyse and describe nurses' self-reported perceptions, views and experiences of the
issue and what aids or impedes it.
The research instrument - a 72 item self-completed questionnaire was developed and
refined within a process of three (3) pilot studies and test-retest method.
A multiple regression model was developed to establish the predictors of key clinical
behaviours. Thematic coding was used to analyse the perceptions of these nurses as
to the factors that affect their ability to intervene with patients who have ATODrelated
problems. Convergent and divergent concerns between quantitative and
qualitative findings became apparent.
Thematic analysis of open-ended responses demonstrated that nurses report a complex
of factors that affect their ability and capacity to intervene with patients who have
ATOD-related problems. Among these are factors located within nurses themselves,
within their patient(s), within their workplace, within other health professionals and
within the broader social/cultural context.
The latter part of the thesis systematically considers the relationships between the
quantitative and qualitative findings within this large sample of registered nurses.
From this comprehensive level of analysis, workforce implications for ATOD
education, training and organisational support for nurses, the most numerous group of
health care workers, have been readily identified.
The major empirical finding of this investigation is that there is a significant
difference between positive attitudinal sets and motivation of practicing registered
nurses to perform desired ATOD-related clinical activities, and the lower reported
frequency at which this occurs. The qualitative findings are highly convergent with
the empirical ones. It is the nurse's self-identified lack of knowledge, skills,
experience and confidence that is now reported as having the greatest effect on their
ability to assess, identify and offer brief and timely intervention for patients with
ATOD-related problems, rather than any prevailing beliefs and attitudes that these
patients were not worthy of their care, or outside the legitimate framework of their
nursing role.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcohol</field><field name="subject">Tobacco and Other Drug-related problems</field><field name="subject">Registered Nurses</field><field name="subject">Clinical Behaviours</field><field name="subject">Early Intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20061110.120239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of the ecology and behaviour of 
parthenogenetic and sexual taxa
of the Australian skink, Menetia greyii: implications for coexistence.</field><field name="creator">Griffin, Clare Louise</field><field name="description">Menetia greyii, a small Australian skink, has recently been determined to be a species complex that consists of both sexual and parthenogenetic taxa (Adams et al. 2003). In total, seven distinct taxa have been identified in the south-central region of Australia. This includes three sexual taxa, three apparent parthenogen lineages, and one lizard of uncertain status 

The study population occurs near Bundey Bore station in the semi-arid region of South Australia (approximately 160km north east of Adelaide). At this site, one sexual taxon (SAS) and two all-female parthenogenetic taxa (WP and RP3) were found to occur in sympatry. In a search for ecological differences, I examined spatial, thermal, physiological and morphological niche relationships in the parthenogenetic and sexual forms. Capture rates were used to determine microhabitat and macrohabitat use in the field. The use of different microhabitats and the amount of time spent occupying different exposures (sun vs. shade) were also examined under laboratory conditions. Thermal preferences, physiological performance (sprint speed ability) and daily activity periods were investigated in the laboratory. The study failed to find any major differences among the different taxa that would indicate they are partitioning resources and therefore explain how the sexual and parthenogenetic forms are coexisting. The only difference observed was that the parthenogens expressed superior sprinting ability, running faster than the sexuals over a range of temperatures. In addition, I found that sexual and parthenogenetic females within this population differed very little in their reproductive effort and output, indicating that RP3 and WP parthenogens possess a reproductive advantage over sexual females as a result of not having to produce males (Williams 1975, Maynard-Smith 1978, Bell 1982). In staged interactions between pairs of sexual and parthenogen individuals, the parthenogens were more aggressive and dominated the sexuals. As a result, the parthenogens were able to outcompete the sexuals for food items. This had serious consequences on fitness, with the sexuals losing significantly more weight than the parthenogens. All of these factors would suggest that the parthenogens should eliminate the sexuals at Bundey Bore. Despite this, the parthenogenetic females at Bundey Bore do not outnumber the sexual subpopulation. This raises the question of how the sexuals are persisting. An examination of endoparasites in the scats of parthenogen and sexual M. greyii found that WP parthenogens had significantly higher parasite prevalence than sexuals. Further to this, there is evidence of matings occurring within the study population between sexual males and WP parthenogen females with five tetraploid males being captured. Therefore, WP parthenogens may be suffering from destabilising hybridization. These factors may account for why the parthenogens (or at least the WP parthenogens) have not competitively excluded sexual M. greyii from Bundey Bore. Other possible reasons are discussed in the general discussion in Chapter 8.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parthenogenesis</field><field name="subject">asexual</field><field name="subject">Menetia greyii</field><field name="subject">competition</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070202.132116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">POLITICS AND PLUNDER:
Civil war and regional intervention in Africa</field><field name="creator">Gross, Deanna Katherine</field><field name="description">Over recent decades, civil wars in Africa have taken millions of lives and caused widespread destruction of whole states and regions. The living standards of peoples residing in such states in Africa which have been devastated by war are often deplorable, with violence, disease and poverty characterising life there. Lawlessness is another feature of such wars, making these states optimal places for international terrorist groups to operate in, and from. For both the above reasons, the West should not turn a blind eye to this issue. 

These wars that have occurred in a number of African states, including Rwanda, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Sudan, have often become regionalised with surrounding states increasingly becoming involved. This is particularly the case when economic gain can be sought through involvement in the civil war. The introduction of regional actors into domestic civil wars frequently serves to intensify and prolong the conflict, through an increase of arms and troops entering the fighting. The surrounding state actors largely claim to be involved for political reasons, namely to provide security to their own state. However, numerous credible reports have shown that vast plundering of natural resources has been carried out in war-time by surrounding states in the war-torn state. Consequently, this thesis examines the motives of surrounding state actors when deciding to participate in domestic civil wars of their neighbours. To do this, I compile case studies on both Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo since both states had been ravaged by violent and drawn-out civil wars involving regional actors. Furthermore, the regional actors in both cases (Liberia in Sierra Leone, and particularly Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe in the DRC) have been accused of participating in the wars for economic gain. 

The case studies showed that while political motivations largely drive the initial decision by regional actors to participate in civil wars in their region, it is subsequently economic gain that both allows and compels them to continue their involvement in the civil war. Henceforth, in the final chapter, I put investigate policy suggestions for the future including: prevention of resources being used to fuel warfare through controlling their access to legitimate channels; the use of aid to reduce the likelihood of those in poverty turning to war in pursuit of sustenance, including opportunities to target aid and use compliance with particular peace agreements as a prerequisite for attaining the funding; diversification of the economies of these weak states through development assistance to  reduce risks produced by a high dependency on primary commodity exports for income and financial sanctions in the form of freezing of assets or asset blocking. These policy suggestions seek to address both the political and economic motivations of the surrounding state actors in participating in civil wars in Africa.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sierra leone</field><field name="subject">democratic republic of congo</field><field name="subject">resources</field><field name="subject">war</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">regional</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080502.111658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ancestral Narratives in History and Fiction:
Transforming Identities</field><field name="creator">Habel, Chad Sean</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of ancestral narratives in the fiction of Thomas Keneally and Christopher Koch. Initially, ancestry in literature creates an historical relationship which articulates the link between the past and the present. In this sense ancestry functions as a type of cultural memory where various issues of inheritance can be negotiated. However, the real value of ancestral narratives lies in their power to aid in the construction of both personal and communal identities. They have the potential to transform these identities, to transgress &#147;natural&#148; boundaries and to reshape conventional identities in the light of historical experience.

For Keneally, ancestral narratives depict national forbears who &#147;narrate the nation&#148; into being. His earlier fictions present ancestors of the nation within a mythic and symbolic framework to outline Australian national identity. This identity is static, oppositional, and characterized by the delineation of boundaries which set nations apart from one another. However, Keneally&#146;s more recent work transforms this conventional construction of national identity. It depicts an Irish-Australian diasporic identity which is hyphenated and transgressive: it transcends the conventional notion of nations as separate entities pitted against one another. In this way Keneally&#146;s ancestral narratives enact the potential for transforming identity through ancestral narrative.

On the other hand, Koch&#146;s work is primarily concerned with the intergenerational trauma causes by losing or forgetting one&#146;s ancestral narrative. His novels are concerned with male gender identity and the fragmentation which characterizes a self-destructive idea of maleness. While Keneally&#146;s characters recover their lost ancestries in an effort to reshape their idea of what it is to be Australian, Koch&#146;s main protagonist lives in ignorance of his ancestor&#146;s life. He is thus unable to take the opportunity to transform his masculinity due to the pervasive cultural amnesia surrounding his family history and its role in Tasmania&#146;s past.

While Keneally and Koch depict different outcomes in their fictional ancestral narratives they are both deeply concerned with the potential to transform national and gender identities through ancestry.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chad Sean Habel</field><field name="subject">Flinders University</field><field name="subject">Robert Phiddian</field><field name="subject">Richard Hosking</field><field name="subject">John McLaren</field><field name="subject">Peter Pierce</field><field name="subject">ancestry</field><field name="subject">ancestral</field><field name="subject">ancestors</field><field name="subject">genealogy</field><field name="subject">genealogical</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">cultural memory</field><field name="subject">amnesia</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">social history</field><field name="subject">family history</field><field name="subject">historical fiction</field><field name="subject">adventure fiction</field><field name="subject">Australian Studies</field><field name="subject">Cultural Studies</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">novels</field><field name="subject">historical novels</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Ireland</field><field name="subject">Irish-Australian</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">diaspora</field><field name="subject">roots</field><field name="subject">rhizomes</field><field name="subject">Thomas Keneally</field><field name="subject">Bring Larks and Heroes</field><field name="subject">The Playmaker</field><field name="subject">Bettany's Book</field><field name="subject">Schindler's Ark</field><field name="subject">Our Republic</field><field name="subject">Homebush Boy</field><field name="subject">Christopher Koch</field><field name="subject">Out of Ireland</field><field name="subject">Highways to a War</field><field name="subject">Boys in the Island</field><field name="subject">Crossing the Gap</field><field name="subject">The Doubleman</field><field name="subject">Across the Sea Wall</field><field name="subject">The Many-Coloured Land: A Return to Ireland</field><field name="subject">convicts</field><field name="subject">Tasmania</field><field name="subject">the Stain</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">identification</field><field name="subject">nation</field><field name="subject">nationalism</field><field name="subject">national identity</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">gender identity</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">male</field><field name="subject">male-ness</field><field name="subject">transformation</field><field name="subject">reconciliation</field><field name="subject">post-colonial</field><field name="subject">post-colonialism</field><field name="subject">anti-colonial</field><field name="subject">literary criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20071108.133216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Absolute Electron Scattering Cross Sections for the CF2 Radical</field><field name="creator">Hargreaves, Leigh Randall</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an experimental study of elastic electron scattering from
CF2 radicals, in the intermediate energy regime. Measurements of the absolute
differential, integral and momentum transfer cross sections for CF2 are presented.
These measurements were performed using a new crossed beam spectrometer,
incorporating a supersonic gas source and normalised using a new technique,
with both of these features being extensively developed as a major part of this
study.

The organisation of this thesis is as follows: A brief justification for this research
is presented in Chapter 1, together with a review of the spectroscopy and
electron collision cross sections which are currently available for the CF2 radical.
The crossed beamed apparatus and experimental techniques used to perform the
present cross section measurements are then described in detail in Chapter 2, and
the theory behind the new normalisation technique is subsequently presented in
Chapter 3.

Results from the present study are given in Chapter 4. Firstly, differential cross
sections measurements for stable molecules are presented, to validate the new
normalisation method. Characterisation data for the dissociation dynamics of
C2F4 into CF2 radicals are then presented and, finally, differential cross section
measurements for the CF2 radical are explored. Where possible, the measured
data for CF2 are compared against results from theoretical calculations and the
implications of the present results are discussed. The major findings of this
research are then summarised in Chapter 5, and directions for future research
using the present apparatus are also discussed here. Finally, some additional
findings from this research and calibration data for the current apparatus are
given in the appendices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electron scattering</field><field name="subject">cross sections</field><field name="subject">radicals</field><field name="subject">SSRDM</field><field name="subject">CF2</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080430.103821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">B Cell antigen D8/17 as a marker of susceptibility to rheumatic fever in Australians
and
The sharp end of the needle:
Rheumatic fever prophylaxis and concepts of care for Yolngu patients

A thesis in two parts</field><field name="creator">Harrington, Zinta</field><field name="description">Aboriginal Australians have some of the world&#239;&#191;&#189;s highest rates of rheumatic fever. Two approaches to reducing the burden of rheumatic fever are discussed in this thesis. The B cell antigen D8/17 has a strong association with rheumatic heart disease and may be a universal marker of inherited susceptibility to rheumatic fever. Identifying a population at increased risk of rheumatic fever provides an opportunity to focus primary prevention measures. In part one of the thesis I evaluate the accuracy of D8/17 as a marker of past rheumatic fever amongst Australians from the Northern Territory. D8/17 levels were measured and compared in patients with acute rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease or past rheumatic fever, first-degree relatives and healthy, unrelated controls. The mean percentage of B cells positive for D8/17 was 83.7%, 38.9%, 20.2% and 11.6% respectively. The difference between the groups was significant (p-value less than 0.0001). A receiver operator curve analysis indicated that 22.1% of B cells positive for D8/17 was the most accurate cut-off to distinguish patients with acute or past rheumatic fever from healthy subjects. These results indicated that the B cell antigen D8/17 is an accurate marker of past rheumatic fever in Aboriginal Australians and could be a helpful addition to the Jones Criteria for strengthening or excluding a diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever. The intermediate levels of D8/17 expression in the relatives of index cases supports the hypothesis that D8/17 is a marker of an inherited susceptibility to rheumatic fever, although prospective trials are required to provide conclusive proof of this hypothesis. 

Non-compliance with secondary prophylaxis was suspected to be the cause of increasing rates of rheumatic fever in the Top End. In part two of the thesis I discuss the &#239;&#191;&#189;problem of compliance&#239;&#191;&#189; with respect to Aboriginal patients, and investigate the factors that affected the delivery and uptake of prophylaxis for rheumatic fever in an Aboriginal community. Patients, relatives and health practitioners were interviewed on the topic of the care of patients with rheumatic heart disease. The data were analysed using the principles of grounded theory. 

The main finding was the desire for more personalised care and support for patients with rheumatic heart disease from the community clinic, rather than simple medical care. These ideas crystallised through two Yolngu terms to describe care: djaka (to physically care for) and gungayun  (to encourage). Thus even from the outset there was divergence in the focus of the &#239;&#191;&#189;consumer&#239;&#191;&#189;- holistic care - and that of the health-care professional/ researcher &#239;&#191;&#189; improving the rate of secondary prophylaxis coverage. 

With regards to service provision, a significant reason for failure to receive secondary prophylaxis was the differing approaches of urban and community health services, patient mobility, and a differing understanding of the responsibilities of patients and health service providers in the different settings. Other factors pertaining to service provision, such as staff motivation, administrative issues and program coordination affected the uptake of secondary prophylaxis to a lesser extent. With regards to treatment uptake, individual patient factors inhibiting uptake of treatment were apparent in some cases, but treatment refusal was rare. Pain was not found to be a deterrent.  No simple relationship was found between treatment compliance and biomedical knowledge of the disease. There was no simple relationship between patient passivity and sense of responsibility that guaranteed compliance.

This study demonstrated that the failure to achieve good uptake of prophylaxis for rheumatic fever related as much to factors of service provision as patient factors and that providing holistic care within a familiar and supportive framework is important to Yolngu patients. However, there are real difficulties for health services as they are currently structured to meet the expectations of patients and families.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">compliance</field><field name="subject">aboriginal</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060219.200649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development Contact Zone: Practitioner Perspectives on Culture, Power and Participation</field><field name="creator">Harris, Vandra</field><field name="description">This research examines the function of culture and power in Development praxis, as defined by Post-Development theory, the Participation approach to Development, and Development workers in Cambodia and the Philippines.  Practitioner perspectives have been gathered by means of informal interviews conducted in Cambodia and the Philippines.  The primary inquiry of this thesis is whether Development is culturally destructive, whether the current paradigm can deliver effective results, and what effect power relations have on these outcomes.  

The research approaches Development as a contact zone, in which Southern Development workers function as border crossers, moving between the cultures of funders and local communities as they work to implement Development projects and programs.  This affords practitioners privileged insight into the cultural negotiations of this contact, making their input critical to this inquiry.  Their input is placed in the context of Post-Development theorists&#239;&#191;&#189; assertion that Development is a culturally destructive discourse, and the proposal by other theorists that a participatory approach to Development adequately addresses Post-Development&#239;&#191;&#189;s key concerns. Participation addresses issues of power and context in Development practice from a different perspective from the Post-Development theorists, and outlines a series of strategies designed to overcome well-recognised limitations of Development practice.

Practitioner responses are grouped into three discussions, addressing their overall perspective on Development and Participation, their attitudes to cultural change and Development&#239;&#191;&#189;s role within that, and their experience of power in Development funding relationships.  Their responses were overwhelmingly supportive of participatory approaches to Development, and advocated a stronger role for the grassroots organisations that are pivotal to the Post-Development approach.  Different attitudes to cultural change were expressed by practitioners in the two countries, however they consistently named Development as a source of positive cultural change, naming this as a key aim of their work.  Finally, practitioners were critical of their relationships with funding organisations, which they felt were unduly controlled by the funders.

This research concludes that participatory Development fosters cultural liberty by reinforcing collaborative cultural traits and strengthening communities to make choices about culture.  While Post-Development provides important critiques of Development, its proposed alternative of turning to the grassroots is not supported by practitioners, who seek ongoing relationships with Northern organisations and individuals.  In particular, practitioners desire a model of funding relationship that reflects their own practice, by conforming to the paradigm of people that underpins the participatory approach to Development.

This thesis contributes to Development debates by presenting Southern perspectives that contrast with Post-Development, and by proposing a framework that can underpin further development of funding partnerships.  Furthermore, it demonstrates that practitioners believe that Development is a reinforcing factor at a time when cultures are exposed to increasingly diverse cultural influences.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">development studies</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">post-development</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">Cambodia</field><field name="subject">NGOs</field><field name="subject">aid</field><field name="subject">development workers</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060315.221724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Comparative Study of Community Participation in the Philippines</field><field name="creator">Heyward, Benjamin Rex</field><field name="description">Community participation takes place when community members act together as subjects.  It is argued here that community participation empowers when community members take decisions, or negotiate an equitable share in making the decisions that affect them. However, since participation takes place within a network of power relations it is not necessarily empowering but can take a range of forms from enforcement to empowerment, whereby empowerment may involve not only willing cooperation, but also resistance to outsider project objectives.  This thesis explores these issues through a study of how people in three Philippine upland communities participated in soil conservation and livelihood restoration projects initiated by three different NGOs.

The principal aim of the study was to identify and examine the changing discourses of development and participation held by the NGOs and by the members of the subject communities. The development discourses revolved around socio-ecology, described as the relationship between the culture and society of Filipino subsistence smallholders and the ecological units of their local environment. The failure of this existing socio-ecology under the pressure of increasing population density on a limited upland resource base was the stimulus for change in the study communities.  The thesis compares the NGOs&#146; practice of engaging with the communities with their discourses of participation, and examines the importance of the relationships between the NGOs, government agencies and the communities for the success of the projects. 

The study identified several key factors in the empowerment of subject groups.  Firstly, the need for a discourse that enables them to embark on socio-ecological change.  For the Filipino communities examined here, the discourse of sustainability was validated by enabling the restoration of their livelihoods. Secondly, outside agencies, either NGO or government, may be needed to catalyse community change processes.  Thirdly, the subjects need leaders who have the vision and skills to work for the desired livelihood and social development outcomes.  Training activities of livelihood restoration proved highly significant in expanding women&#146;s political space that led to opportunities for them to take up leadership, as well as giving capacity-building training for existing and future leaders which helped to equalize gender relations between men and women.  Fourthly, the policy and program initiatives of host government agencies can synergize with community and partner agency activities at several levels, including resourcing and building the capacities of leadership.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">community based organizations</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">sustainability discourse</field><field name="subject">socio-ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070328.131827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Another world is possible:  Tourism, globalisation and the responsible alternative</field><field name="creator">Higgins-Desbiolles, B. Freya</field><field name="description">Utilising a critical theoretical perspective, this work examines contemporary corporatised tourism and capitalist globalisation.  This analysis suggests that marketisation limits the understanding of the purposes of tourism to its commercial and &#147;industrial&#148; features, thereby marginalising wider understandings of the social importance of tourism.  

Sklair&#146;s conceptualisation of capitalist globalisation and its dynamics, as expressed in his &#147;sociology of the global system&#148; (2002), is employed to understand the corporatised tourism phenomenon.  This thesis explains how a corporatised tourism sector has been created by transnational tourism and travel corporations, professionals in the travel and tourism sector, transnational practices such as the liberalisation being imposed through the General Agreement on Trade in Services negotiations and the culture-ideology of consumerism that tourists have adopted.  This thesis argues that this reaps profits for industry and exclusive holidays for privileged tourists, but generates social and ecological costs which inspire vigorous challenge and resistance.  

This challenge is most clearly evident in the alternative tourism movement which seeks to provide the equity and environmental sustainability undermined by the dynamics of corporatised tourism.  Alternative tourism niches with a capacity to foster an &#147;eco-humanism&#148; are examined by focusing on ecotourism, sustainable tourism, pro-poor tourism, fair trade in tourism, community-based tourism, peace through tourism, volunteer tourism and justice tourism.  While each of these demonstrates certain transformative capacities, some prove to be mild reformist efforts and others promise more significant transformative capacity.  In particular, the niches of volunteer tourism and justice tourism demonstrate capacities to mount a vigorous challenge to both corporatised tourism and capitalist globalisation.  Since the formation of the Global Tourism Interventions Forum (GTIF) at the World Social Forum gathering in Mumbai in 2004, justice tourism has an agenda focused on overturning corporatised tourism and capitalist globalisation, and inaugurating a new alternative globalisation which is both &#147;pro-people&#148; and sustainable.

Following the development of these original, macro-level conceptualisations of tourism and globalisation, this thesis presents a micro-level case study of an Indigenous Australian tourism enterprise which illustrates some of these dynamics in a local context.  Camp Coorong Race Relations and Cultural Education Centre established and run by the Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal community of South Australia has utilised tourism to foster greater equity and sustainability by working towards reconciliation through tourism.  The Ngarrindjeri have also experienced conflicts generated from the pressures of inappropriate tourism development which has necessitated an additional strategy of asserting their Indigenous rights in order to secure Ngarrindjeri lifeways.  

The case study analysis suggests that for alternative tourism to create the transformations that contemporary circumstances require, significant political change may be necessary.  This includes fulfilment of economic, social and cultural rights to which a majority of nations have committed but have to date failed to implement.  While this is a challenge for nation-states and is beyond the capacities of tourism alone, tourism nonetheless can be geared toward greater equity and sustainability if the perspective that corporatised tourism is the only option is resisted.  This thesis demonstrates that another tourism is possible; one that is geared to public welfare, human fulfilment, solidarity and ecological living.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">alternative tourism</field><field name="subject">corporatised tourism</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">Indigenous tourism</field><field name="subject">Indigenous rights</field><field name="subject">eco-humanism</field><field name="subject">justice tourism</field><field name="subject">Camp Coorong</field><field name="subject">tourism as a social force</field><field name="subject">reconciliation tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20061218.155946</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Salafism and the Internet in Contemporary Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Iqbal, Asep Muhamad</field><field name="description">This study deals with the relationship between religious fundamentalism and the internet. It aims to be a critique of the conception that religion and modernization are inherently incompatible; that modernization leads to the death of religion, as advocated the secularization theorists. It argues that the notion is an inaccurate characterization and understanding of the interplay between the forces of religion and modernization; rather, both co-exist and mutually reinforce one another.  It also argues that it is inappropriate to label religious fundamentalism as an anti-modern movement; it might be true that it is ideologically ultra-orthodox, but it is technologically a modern movement. The value of this study lies in its findings that the most conservative religious groups like the Salafi community not only persist in the face of modernization, but also transform realities of modernity like the internet into a new form of modern product that serves well their religious needs and interests. To support this, I analysed Salafism, a transnational Islamic fundamentalist movement, and its use of the internet within the Indonesian context to uncover how they employ the technology.  I examined the ways the Salafis use the internet in accordance with their ideological purposes in the frameworks of &#145;cultured technology&#146;, localization process of global force of information technology, appropriation of global media, and spiritualizing technology. Textual analysis was mainly employed as a method to understand the Salafi web contents and uncover the ways the Salafi use the internet.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salafism</field><field name="subject">Salaf</field><field name="subject">the Salafi movement</field><field name="subject">the internet</field><field name="subject">religious fundamentalism</field><field name="subject">modernization</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080722.111604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating Surface-Atmosphere Exchange at Regional Scales</field><field name="creator">Isaac, Peter Robert</field><field name="description">This thesis examines a method for estimating the daytime fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide at regional scales by using simple models to combine spatially resolved surface properties with bulk meteorological quantities measured at a central location.  The central themes of this thesis are that the spatial and temporal variability of regional scale fluxes are contained in the surface properties and meteorology respectively and that the surface properties can be interpolated across a heterogeneous landscape using remotely sensed data.  The regional scale fluxes estimated using this technique are compared to the values from three other methods and this allows some conclusions to be made regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method.  The surface property approach yields robust estimates of the fluxes that will be useful in researching exchange processes at regional scales, providing input parameters for, and validation of, the biosphere components of General Circulation Models and testing inventory estimates of CO2 budgets.
The surface properties are derived using data from 33 aircraft flights and eight ground-based sites along a 96 km transect established during the 1995 Observations At Several Interacting Scales experiment held near Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia.  Surface properties examined are the evaporative fraction (ratio of evapotranspiration to available energy), the Bowen ratio (ratio of sensible heat flux to evapotranspiration), the maximum stomatal conductance (maximum stomatal opening under optimal conditions) and the water-use efficiency (ratio of CO2 flux to evapotranspiration).  Maximum stomatal conductance is calculated using a simple model of the stomatal response to light and water vapour deficit assuming soil evaporation occurs at the equilibrium rate.  The diurnal trend and day-to-day variability in the surface properties is found to be significantly less than the spatial variability.  All of the surface properties examined show some sensitivity to the synoptic conditions.
The relationships between the surface properties and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are examined using a 130 km by 50 km sub-scene from a Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image obtained five days before the start of the experiment period.  The ground-based and aircraft observations are used to calculate the source-area influencing each measurement and this is combined with the Landsat 5 TM data to produce an average, source-area weighted NDVI for each ground-based site and each aircraft location.  The source-area model is important because it provides the link between the observations and the remotely sensed data by identifying the surface patch that influences the measurements.  Linear relationships are found between the source-area weighted NDVI and the surface properties.  The observed relationships are used to interpolate the surface properties over the region covered by the satellite image and spatial variations in water loss and CO2 uptake by the surface vegetation are identified that are not resolved by the ground-based network.
Analysis of the ground-based data showed that the spatial variability of the bulk meteorological quantities used in the surface property approach was much less than the diurnal trend in these data.  With the small temporal variation in the surface properties noted before, this confirms the utility of assigning the spatial and temporal variability of the fluxes to the surface properties and the meteorology respectively.
The combination of surface properties derived from the aircraft data and meteorology measured at a single location at the centre of the transect shows good skill in predicting the observed fluxes.  Furthermore, the discrepancies between the predictions and the observations are explained by the different source-areas of the aircraft and ground-based data and much of the bias is removed when the surface properties are scaled from the NDVI of the aircraft source-area to the NDVI of the ground-based sites.  Regional scale fluxes of heat and water vapour calculated using the surface property approach agree with averages of the ground-based data and this indicates that the ground-based network was representative of the OASIS region.  Estimates of regional scale CO2 fluxes are not available from the ground-based network due to the lack of measurements at the driest ground-based site but the surface property approach yields plausible values.  The results demonstrate the utility of extrapolating surface properties across heterogeneous landscapes using remotely sensed data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface fluxes</field><field name="subject">regional scale</field><field name="subject">ground-based</field><field name="subject">tower</field><field name="subject">aircraft</field><field name="subject">remote sensing</field><field name="subject">OASIS</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060412.170700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Total Synthesis of the Putative Structure of Tridachiahydropyrone</field><field name="creator">Jeffery, David William</field><field name="description">Polypropionate marine natural products have emerged as a class of compounds that display a high degree of structural diversity. Specifically, metabolites such as that reported as tridachiahydropyrone (7), isolated from sacoglossan molluscs, display novel ring systems. The introductory chapter gives some background on tridachione marine natural products and outlines the isolation of metabolites from several species of sacoglossan mollusc. Chapter One also gives examples of the utility of the tandem conjugate addition-Dieckmann condensation approach being applied to the synthesis of these compounds.

Chapter Two describes the development of the tandem conjugate addition-Dieckmann condensation and subsequent trans methylation approach to cyclohexenone rings. The synthetic strategy utilised chiral, functionalised cyclohexenone rings as synthons in the formation of bicyclic ring systems, so development of the carbocyclic ring formation was of vital importance to the overall strategy. Examples are given which confirm the viability of the proposed synthetic route to cyclohexenones such as 91, 92 and 104 from the reaction of [alpha,beta]-unsaturated carbonyl compounds 39 and 59 with dialkyl and dialkenyl Gilman cuprates.

Chapter Three describes the incorporation of chiral cyclohexenone 117 into the bicyclic framework of model compound 105, analogous to the marine natural product reported as tridachiahydropyrone (7). The chapter explores the use of cyclohexenone precursor 43 that contained the total carbon framework of the bicyclic core of the desired pyrone. Once again, a tandem conjugate addition-cyclisation reaction was employed using a dialkyl Gilman cuprate, followed by trans methylation to give the requisite cyclohexenone synthon 117. A novel Eaton&#146;s reagent-promoted intramolecular cyclisation of acid 122 to pyrone 123 was then effected. Subsequent O-methylation afforded [alpha]-methoxy-[beta]-methyl-[gamma]-pyrone 105 as a single enantiomer, which had the identical core structure to the natural product. The structure, including relative stereochemistry of 105, was confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis.

Chapter Four builds on the previous two chapters and describes the conjugate addition-cyclisation with a higher order Gilman cuprate derived from vinyl bromide 44, which would deliver the vinyl side-chain required for the synthesis of reported natural product 7. The same acyclic precursor 43 as used in Chapter Three was cyclised and methylated to yield yet another cyclohexenone synthon 41. A single crystal X-ray analysis of related alcohol 162 confirmed the relative stereochemistry and structure. Another novel P2O5-mediated intramolecular cyclisation was achieved to give pyrone 168 and O-methylation provided a compound with the reported structure of natural product 7 as a single enantiomer. The structure of synthetic 7 was established unequivocally through extensive NMR studies. Comparisons of spectral data confirmed that natural tridachiahydropyrone was not the same as synthetic compound 7, so revision of the assigned natural product structure is warranted. Several other analogues were also synthesised using this methodology, highlighting the versatility of the method under development.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine polypropionates</field><field name="subject">tridachiahydropyrone</field><field name="subject">conjugate addition</field><field name="subject">Dieckmann condensation</field><field name="subject">Eaton's reagent</field><field name="subject">P2O5-mediated cyclisation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20050603.095257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biocentric Theology: Christianity celebrating humans as an ephemeral part of life, not the centre of it</field><field name="creator">John, Jason Robert</field><field name="description">When the Uniting Church formed in 1977, its Basis of Union envisaged a final reconciliation and renewal for all creation, not just humans.  It did, nonetheless, reflect the anthropocentric assumptions of its day, as did other official documents released in the first decade of the Uniting Church&#146;s life.  

Anthropocentrism assumes that human beings alone are created in the image of God, charged with dominion over Earth, and responsible for the fallenness of creation, though not necessarily through the actions of a literal Adam and Eve.  This basic framework did not shift in the first decade, even though Earth began to be talked about not as an inanimate resource for human consumption, but something good and valuable in and of itself.

In 1990 this anthropocentric paradigm began to be challenged, and during 2000-2002 two quite irreconcilable understandings of the relationship between God and Earth, and thus humans and other animals existed side by side in Uniting Church worship resources.

Having listened carefully to the story of life as told by ecological and evolutionary scientists, I conclude that the traditional anthropocentric paradigm is no longer tenable.  Instead I propose that all of life is the image of God, in its evolutionary past, ecological present and unknown future.  All of life is in direct relationship with God, and exercises dominion of Earth.  Evidence traditionally used as evidence of the fallenness of creation is instead affirmed as an essential part of life, though life on Earth has experienced a number of significant &#147;falls&#148; in biodiversity.  

Even the more biocentric thought in recent Uniting Church resources is inadequate, because its language implies that life is simple, static, benign, and to some extent designed by God.  In order to be adequately consonant with the life sciences, theology must be able to accept that finitude (pain, suffering and death) is a good part of creation, for without it there could be no life.  This is an emphasis of ecofeminism, which I extend to affirm not only individual death, but the extinction of whole species, including humans.  

I argue that the purpose of creation was not the evolution of humans, but to make possible God&#146;s desire for richness of experience, primarily mediated through relationships.  Whilst this idea is well established in process theology, it must be purged of its individualistic and consciousness-centric biases to be adequately consonant with the scientific story of life.

The resulting biocentric paradigm has several implications for our understanding of Jesus.  I argue that he offers salvation from the overwhelming fear of finitude, rather than finitude itself.  Against the trend in ecotheology, I propose that this saving work is directed in the first instance to humans only.  I tentatively propose that it is directed to only some humans.  This, paradoxically, is more affirming of God&#146;s relationship with the rest of creation than most ecotheology, which proclaims Jesus as a global or universal saviour.  Salvation for some humans, and all non human creatures, happens only in a secondary sense, because this is the only sense in which they need saving.  I then speculate on whether and how it might be possible for a Christian biocentric community to live out its salvation.
 
Finally, I revisit the Basis of Union and argue that although the biocentric theology I have proposed goes well beyond the Basis, it is not at odds with the Basis&#146; directions and intentions.  Biocentric theology is, rather, an extension of the trajectories already contained within the Basis, with its trust in the eventual reconciliation and renewal of all creation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecotheology</field><field name="subject">anthropocentrism</field><field name="subject">progressive christianity</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20051212.182616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Changing of the Guard: conceptualisations of
prison officers' work in three South Australian
prisons</field><field name="creator">King, Susan Therese</field><field name="description">The prison officer is central to prison life, yet understandings of this role are limited.
This thesis argues that the two overarching (and often competitive)conceptualisations of prison officers' work as custodial work or human services work are limited. Eight conceptualisations of prison officers' work from the correctional literature are identified - Para-military officer, Security Officer, Warehouser of
prisoners, Public Servant /bureaucrat, Professional, Manager of Prisoners ,
Therapist and Case Manager. These conceptualisations are defined and related to one another by examining their
construction through discourses of prison purpose and prison process (Adler and
Longhurst 1994).

The thesis develops the analysis of du Gay (1996) that organisations use discourse as a means of constructing work identities for their employees and the work of Halford and Leonard (1999) who argue that workers are active agents in this process and do not always take on the identity the organisation is seeking to promote.

The thesis addresses three research questions
 How has the role of the prison officer been conceptualised by the South Australian Department for Correctional Services over time?
 How is the role of the prison officer currently conceptualised by personnel working within South Australian prisons, what influences the way the role is conceptualised and what purposes do these conceptualisations serve?
 To what extent have the new conceptualisations of the role of the prison officer,
articulated by the Department for Correctional Services in the last ten years, been adopted by staff within prisons and what determines the influence of these new conceptualisations? These questions are addressed using qualitative research techniques of document
analysis and semi-structured interviews.

The thesis identifies that in recent decades the Department has emphasised conceptualisations of the role constructed from normalisation and rehabilitative discourses. Interviewees, forty-four working in three South Australian prisons, (both departmental and privately managed), conceptualised the work of a prison officer as
complex and unique and identified three influential audiences for the performance of
prison officers' work &#150; prisoners, officers and their colleagues, and the Departmental
hierarchy. Interviewees constructed the role of the prison officer in terms that would
earn respect for the work from each of these audiences and manage the vulnerability of the officer as a worker and a prison officer. Half of those interviewed conceptualised the prison officer based on a Manager of Prisoners. Other
interviewees, critical of the role within their prison, described it as a Warehouser and
saw the competition between custodial and human services roles as irreconcilable.

The thesis argues that Departmental discourse can be seen to have a significant influence on the conceptualisation of the prison officer&#146;s role by those working within prisons, but that it competes for influence with the discourse of the other powerful audiences for the performance of prison officers' work &#150; prisoners and
other staff.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">correctional officers</field><field name="subject">warders</field><field name="subject">correctional services</field><field name="subject">prisoners</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070313.175216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and Generating Complex Emergent Behaviour</field><field name="creator">Kitto, Kirsty</field><field name="description">Despite a general recognition of the importance of complex systems, there is a dearth of general models capable of describing their dynamics. This is attributed to a complexity scale; the models are attempting to describe systems at different parts of the scale and are hence not compatible. We require new models capable of describing complex behaviour at different points of the complexity scale. This work identifies, and proceeds to examine systems at the high end of the complexity scale, those which have not to date been well understood by our current modelling
methodology. It is shown that many such models exhibit what might be termed contextual dependency, and that it is precisely this feature which is not well understood by our current modelling methodology. A particular problem is
discussed; our apparent inability to generate systems which display high end complexity, exhibited by for example
the general failure of strong ALife. A new model, Process Physics, that has been developed at Flinders University is discussed, and arguments are presented that it exhibits high end complexity. The features of this model that
lead to its displaying such behaviour are discussed, and the generalisation of this model to a broader range of complex systems is attempted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">contextuality</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">reductive failure</field><field name="subject">Process Physics</field><field name="subject">quantum theories as models of complexity</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060626.132947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Process Physics: Bootstrapping Reality from the Limitations of Logic</field><field name="creator">Klinger, Christopher Martin</field><field name="description">For all the successes of the two edifices of modern physics, quantum theory and Einstein's relativity, a fundamental description of the Universe as a whole -- a theory that informs as to the true nature of reality -- has continued to elude science. This thesis describes the development and evolution of a new paradigm called Process Physics, a radical information-theoretic modelling of reality. It is argued that the failure of the extant approaches in physics is the direct consequence of limitations stemming from the mathematization, language and methodology of theoretical physics: the limitations of the postulated background spatial concepts and geometric modelling of time, the limitations of quantum theory in its failure to account for the measurement process and classicality; and the limitations of formal systems. In contrast, Process Physics utilizes the limitations of logic first identified by Godel and asserts the priority of process and relational endophysics, realized via a stochastic, autopoietic bootstrap system whose properties emerge a posteriori rather than being assumed a priori. The work is arranged in two parts. Part I discusses the historical, philosophical, and metaphysical foundations of physics to consider how the prevailing views in modern physics arose and what this revealed and contributed to the development of Process Physics. Part II describes the fundamentals of the new theory and its implementation, and demonstrates the viability of looking outside the current paradigms by showing that Process Physics yields unified emergent phenomena that permit an understanding of fundamental processes and penultimately motivate both quantum theory and relativity as relevant higher-level descriptors within their respective domains.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Process Physics</field><field name="subject">cosmology</field><field name="subject">pre-geometry</field><field name="subject">bootstrap</field><field name="subject">endophysics</field><field name="subject">stochastic</field><field name="subject">Godel</field><field name="subject">limitations of logic</field><field name="subject">autopoiesis</field><field name="subject">randomness</field><field name="subject">emergence</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080430.132508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biodegradation of High Molecular Weight Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Soils by Defined Bacterial and Fungal Cocultures</field><field name="creator">Lease, Christopher William Minto</field><field name="description">Despite microbial degradation being the primary route of degradation of PAHs in soils, high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzo[a]pyrene) have consistently proven to e resistant to microbial attack. However, recent research has demonstrated the potential for bacterial-fungal co-cultures to achieve biodegradation of high molecular weight PAHs. The aim of this research was to determine the efficacy of co-culture bioaugmentation for the remediation of high molecular weight PAHcontaminated soils.

PAH degrading bacteria were enriched on multiple PAHs and isolated on pyrene from both contaminated (soil from a former manufactured gas plant) and uncontaminated (agricultural soil, termite mound matrix and kangaroo faeces) sources. The bacterial isolates were identified using 16SrRNA analysis as Mycobacterium sp. Strain BS5, Mycobacterium sp. Strain KA5 and Mycobacterium sp. Strain KF4 or fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis as Ralstonia pickettii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

The initial phase of assessment of PAH degradation by fungal and bacterial coculture components was undertaken using liquid media. Two fungal isolates from a previous investigation into the coculture process (Penicillium janthinellum) and the American Type Culture Collection (Phanerochaete chrysosporium) were assessed for their ability to degrade benzo[a]pyrene in minimal media and MYPD. The fungal isolates were found to be able to degrade benzo[a]pyrene cometabolically in MYPD. The bacterial isolates and two others from previous investigations were assessed for their ability to degrade single PAHs (fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene) in liquid culture. This process was used as an initial screen to select the best bacterial isolates for further investigation of PAH degradation by axenic cultures and cocultures with the fungal isolates using a PAH mixture. Based on the results of these experiments four bacterial isolates (VUN 10,010, Mycobacterium 1B, Mycobacterium sp. Strain BS5 and Mycobacterium sp. Strain KA5) and the two fungal isolates were selected to investigate further using a PAH mixture composed of the previously mentioned PAHs. It was found that the use of a fungal bacterial coculture increased the degradation of the PAH mixture beyond that of axenic bacterial cultures. Based on these experiments, the coculture composed of P. janthinellum and VUN 10,010 was selected for assessment of its ability to degrade the same PAH mixture in spiked soil microcosm experiments. 

Natural attenuation, axenic P. janthinellum, axenic VUN 10,010 and a coculture of these two organisms were assessed for PAH degradation in soil microcosms over a 100 day period. Inoculation of microcosms with the coculture resulted in the removal of benzo[a]pyrene by 11 mg/kg (&#177; 1.21 mg/kg) (30%) over the 100 day incubation period. Substantial PAH degradation was also observed in the microcosms assesing natural attenuation.

Using an alternative sequential inoculation method, initially inoculating with P. janthinellum then 50 days later with VUN 10,010 significantly enhanced the removal of benzo[a]pyrene. After 100 days incubation, benzo[a]pyrene was degraded below detection limits in two of three microcosms, compared to a 4.95 mg/kg (&#177; 4.64 mg/kg) (14.7 %) reduction in soil microcosms inoculated using an alternative inoculation process of VUN 10,010 followed by P. janthinellum.

Attempts were made to optimise the process using sequential inoculation and soil amendments intended to enhance the performance of the fungal component using distilled water and 1% glucose. The addition of distilled water was not observed to substantially influence the ability of the coculture to degrade PAHs, whereas the addition of 1% glucose was found to inhibit PAH degradation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coculture</field><field name="subject">bacterial</field><field name="subject">fungal</field><field name="subject">degradation</field><field name="subject">polycyclic</field><field name="subject">hydrocarbons</field><field name="subject">soil</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060803.114120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Total Synthesis of Auripyrone A and Related Metabolites</field><field name="creator">Lister, Troy</field><field name="description">In recent decades the emergence of marine polypropionate natural products as compounds of diverse structural complexity and intriguing biological activity has influenced the advancement of asymmetric synthesis and predicated detailed studies of marine ecology. The introductory chapter of this thesis explores the nature of marine natural products, including their structure, biological activity and biosynthesis. Additionally, a brief review of the aldol reaction is presented. This well established biomimetic chemical transformation underpins polyketide synthesis and was utilised extensively in the research contributing to this dissertation. Chapter Two describes the first asymmetric total synthesis of the two marine polypropionates isolated from specimens of Siphonaria australis by Hochlowski et al. in 1984. Spectroscopic analysis revealed hemiacetal 22 and ester 23 to be identical to the secondary metabolites extracted from the marine pulmonate. The synthetic approach to hemiacetal 22 utilised lactate derived ketone (S)-67 to control the configuration of the C7 and C8 stereocentres and involved the discovery of a mild protocol for the synthesis of trimethylsilyl enol ether 109, which was employed for a Mukaiyama aldol homologation reaction. Additionally, ester 23 was synthesised from hemiacetal 22 via a retro-Claisen fragmentation.

The retro-Claisen approach utilised in the synthesis of ester 23 was extended in Chapter Three to serve as the pivotal transformation in an attempted total synthesis of the unusual marine polypropionate dolabriferol (30). The strategy toward dolabriferol (30) involved an iterative homologation of chiral ketone (S)-67 to install all but one of the requisite stereocentres in the natural product. Chemoselective deprotection of acyclic precursor 160 gave the elaborate 2,4,6-trioxaadamantane 167, whose participation as a protecting group mimic lead to the formation of ester 169 after reaction of the polycycle 167 with base. The synthesis of ester 169, which represents a direct precursor to dolabriferol (30), was achieved in 16 steps with an overall yield of 24%. Unfortunately, a robust protecting group on ester 169 prohibited a synthesis of dolabriferol (30), but intriguingly in one deprotection of ester 169 with aqueous hydrofluoric acid, spiroacetal 172 was isolated.

Chapter Four describes the first total synthesis of cytotoxic marine polypropionate auripyrone A (78) and establishes the absolute configuration of this important natural product as that depicted for compound 78. The requisite C8-C12 stereopentad of auripyrone A (78) was formulated from Evans&#239;&#191;&#189; dipropionate equivalent 53 in a double stereodifferentiating aldol reaction, followed by syn-reduction to give diol 206. Differentiation of the secondary alcohols in compound 206 was achieved by migration of the PMB protecting group and protection at C11 with the requisite acyloxy group of auripyrone A (78). Differential protection was critical to achieving selective spiroacetalisation to afford the unique spiroacetal dihydropyrone core of the natural product. The utility of LiHMDS for highly selective double stereodifferentiating aldol homologations of sensitive fragments is also discussed. This mild aldol protocol was pivotal to forming the carbogenic skeleton of auripyrone A, in particular, elaborate adduct 278.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine polypropionate</field><field name="subject">Auripyrone</field><field name="subject">Siphonaria australis</field><field name="subject">dolabriferol</field><field name="subject">2</field><field name="subject">4</field><field name="subject">6-trioxaadamantane</field><field name="subject">spiroacetal dihydropyrone</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060804.125858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grounds for Hope and Disappointment: Victims&#146;/Survivors&#146; Perceptions of South Australia Police Responses to Rape</field><field name="creator">McLachlan, Katherine Jane</field><field name="description">Internationally, there have been few studies examining the attitudes of people who have been raped towards police (Jordan, 2001a; Lievore, 2005; Temkin, 1997, 1999). Little research in Australia (particularly South Australia) has examined the experiences of victims/survivors of rape with police. Existing data do show that women who have been raped rarely report assaults to police. This has been attributed by researchers to a range of reasons, both personal and systemic, including the influence of stereotypes and myths about rape on victims&#146;/survivors&#146; decision-making. Rape myths often reflect community attitudes, social norms and police responses. For example, victims/survivors may blame themselves and also expect police will blame or disbelieve them. Such expectations (or subsequent experiences) of negative police responses undermine victims&#146;/survivors&#146; faith in police. However, this is not the whole story. In reality, police responses to rape are complex and inconsistent, influenced by both individual and organisational factors. 

I initiated this study to explore victims&#146;/survivors&#146; expectations of, and experiences with, police in a transparent and accessible forum. Based on semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 11 women who had been raped in South Australia, my findings illustrated the diversity of South Australia Police responses to victims/survivors of rape and suggested that South Australia Police practices were similar to those of other Australian and English-speaking jurisdictions. Overall, interactions with South Australia Police &#145;simultaneously provide grounds for hope and are disappointing (Lievore, 2005: 59; emphasis added). In many cases police responses were disappointing, through service provision that was partly or wholly negative. Specific individual and organisational factors were associated with satisfactory or unsatisfactory police practices. Poor service provision was evident in individual police officers&#146; apathy and dismissive or disbelieving responses, and through low prioritisation and limited resourcing of sexual violence at an organisation level. However, my findings indicated that there was also much to be hopeful about when considering South Australia Police responses to rape. The participants in my study often reported exemplary service from individual officers. At the reporting and investigation stages, good practices were based on &#145;procedural justice&#146; rather than &#145;outcome justice&#146;: characterised by strong communication, empathy and professionalism at an individual level and consistency at an organisational level.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Police</field><field name="subject">sexual assault</field><field name="subject">Victims/Survivors</field><field name="subject">perceptions</field><field name="subject">rape</field><field name="subject">police responses</field><field name="subject">rape victims</field><field name="subject">rape survivors</field><field name="subject">sexual crime</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070824.131843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EVOLUTIONARY DIVERSIFICATION OF AUSTRALIAN GALL-INDUCING THRIPS</field><field name="creator">McLeish, Michael John</field><field name="description">This work further elucidates processes involved in promoting and
sustaining evolutionary diversification within the gall-inducing thrips
that specialise on Australian Acacia. A phylogenetic approach was taken
to determine modes of diversification available to these insects. The
extension and revision of the gall-thrips phylogeny is central to the
work and primarily focuses on cryptic populations of the Kladothrips
rugosus and Kladothrips waterhousei species complexes. Parallel
diversification, where the radiation of the K. rugosus and K.
waterhousei lineages broadly mirror one another, offered a rare
opportunity to test hypotheses of coevolution between gall-thrips and
their Acacia hosts. In the absence of a reliable host Acacia phylogeny,
indirect inference of insect/plant cospeciation can be arrived at as
these two complexes share the same set of host species. The expectation
is that if the phylogenies for the gall-thrips complexes show a
significant level of concordance, then cospeciation between insect and
host-plant can be inferred. Results indicate that the K. rugosus species
complex comprise populations at species level. A significant level of
phylogenetic concordance between the two species complexes is consistent
with gall-thrips lineages tracking the diversification of their Acacia
hosts. Given the less than strict form of insect/host cospeciation,
factors impacting host diversification become important to gall-thrips
diversification. Gall-thrips radiated over a period during the expansion
of the Australian arid-zone. Cycles of host range expansion and
fragmentation during the Quaternary could have played a major role in
gall-thrips diversity. An interesting feature of resourse sharing
amongst the K. rugosus and K. waterhousei complex members is the
apparent absence of competitive exclusion between them. The persistence
of this sympatry over millions of years is an unusual feature and merits
further investigation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cryptic species</field><field name="subject">coevolution</field><field name="subject">cospeciation</field><field name="subject">diversification</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070926.173412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Representation of Women in Television Advertisements: a Comparative Analysis in Australia and Bangladesh</field><field name="creator">Mahboob, Shaolee</field><field name="description">This thesis considers women&#146;s representation in television commercials in Australia and
Bangladesh. It is an empirical study. A total of 780 advertisements were recorded from
various television channels of Australia and Bangladesh. Among them 280 and 500
advertisements were taken from Bangladeshi and Australian television channels
respectively. This thesis is about women&#146;s representation in television commercials in
Australia and Bangladesh. Bringing an interdisciplinary but empirical approach to a
broad range of recently screened advertisements, the thesis examines how femininities
are stereotypically represented in these two countries&#146; television commercials. The study
suggests that women are produced and reproduced as sexual objects and/or objects to be
looked at, and that representations of women&#146;s bodies circulate around the binary of
purity and pollution in heavily gendered and racialised ways. The interesting finding of
this study is the extension of the &#145;male-gaze&#146; concept where women come under the gaze
from (hetero) sexual perspectives. The study suggests that images of femininity and
racialisation are produced and reproduced. This constructs women&#146;s secondary position
and creates racial instability in societies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Television advertisements</field><field name="subject">representation</field><field name="subject">male-gaze</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080114.100907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experience of urban water recycling and the development of trust</field><field name="creator">Marks, June Sylvia</field><field name="description">Water scarcity and water pollution are ongoing problems that require a rethinking of water use in the community.  This calls for cooperation between the expert systems of water supply and sewerage as well as some level of public involvement.  It is the interaction between the experts or providers, and the public as users or customers, that is the focus of this study on the experience of recycling water sourced from sewage effluent.  This cross-national research explores the drivers behind water reuse; the way water reuse is presented to the public for consideration; the public response to water reuse; the influence of environmental and public health risk concerns; and the function of trust in the acceptance of potable water reuse and the sustainability of non potable reuse.  

The absence of social science published literature relating to the experience of recycled water guided a grounded theory approach to this research, using a triangulation of methods for data collection and case study analysis.  The social-psychological studies of Bruvold (1972-1988), located in water industry literature, were consulted to organise an audit of secondary, survey data obtained through industry contacts and fieldwork.  In this way, acceptance of potable and non potable water reuse in the USA, UK and Australia is mapped to provide background data for a set of minor case studies that explore the experience of potable reuse.  

Residential water reuse experience is investigated through embedded case study research.  Primary data were collected at two residential sites in Adelaide and two in Florida.  Recycled water is used for garden watering and toilet flushing at New Haven, and is planned for Mawson Lakes in Adelaide.  Altamonte Springs and Brevard County in Florida recycle water for garden watering and outdoor uses only.  Twenty residents were interviewed at each site involving semi-structured interviews: in-depth, face-to-face interviews in Adelaide and telephone interviews on site in Florida.  Individual managers of the recycled water systems were also interviewed and, at New Haven, additional key stakeholders were consulted.  Qualitative data analysis, employing a grounded theory approach, discovered the value of Sztompka&#239;&#191;&#189;s (1999) framework for the &#239;&#191;&#189;social becoming of trust&#239;&#191;&#189;.

This research illustrates that the positive historical culture of trust at the Florida sites, coupled with robust structural support for residential water reuse that encourages positive provider-customer interactions, develops trust in non potable reuse and uses involving a higher level of contact.  In the Adelaide sites, weak structural support induces reliance on informal structure that increases the public health risk, jeopardising the sustainability of residential reuse.  In relation to potable reuse experience that centres on the Californian experience, a social dilemma is created through a strategic, marketing approach to public consultation and the lack of public communication on current water sources.  Sztompka&#239;&#191;&#189;s (1999) framework for trust as an ongoing process is expanded to include principles of public participation that will further consolidate trust in water reuse to achieve sustainable outcomes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water reuse</field><field name="subject">water recycling</field><field name="subject">public perceptions</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060123.214133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of p75NTR Trafficking by Neurotrophins in the NSC-34 Motor Neuron Cell Line</field><field name="creator">Matusica, Dusan</field><field name="description">Neurotrophins are a family of growth factors necessary for the development and maintenance of the nervous system. They produce their effects through receptor mediated signaling mechanisms that are highly regulated by sophisticated intracellular transport networks. The impairment of intracellular trafficking of neurotrophins in motor neurons has been identified as one possible factor in the development of motor neuron diseases, but remains inadequately studied. Aided by advances in imaging technology and the development of more powerful and sensitive detection tools for in-vitro studies, the dynamics of intracellular transport of neurotrophins are beginning to be unraveled. However, a primary limiting factor in the study of neurotrophin-transport dynamics in motor neurons has been the lack of alternative and easily available in-vitro systems able to substitute the often difficult and costly primary motor neuron cultures.
 
The aim of this project was to develop a suitable motor neuron model using the NSC-34 cell line for the study of receptor mediated trafficking events through endosomal transport pathways. Successful evaluation and characterization of NSC-34 cells for motor neuron specific markers would result in the investigation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) trafficking pathways in the presence of exogenous neurotrophins, with a variety of confocal imaging techniques.

Chapter 3 describes the optimisation of NSC-34 cell culture conditions through media modification and the development of a suitable growth substrate matrix, which significantly improved cell adhesion, differentiation and the ability to culture the cells for extended time periods in serum free conditions. Quantitative measurements of cell proliferation, culture viability, cell-body size and neurite length are described to highlight the increased value of the cell line for long-term culture and experiments examining a broad range of issues relevant to motor neurons.

	In Chapter 4, multiple experimental approaches were used to extensively screen the NSC-34 cell line for the presence of motor neuron-specific markers, neurotrophin receptors and proteins involved in regulation of endosomal transport. This characterization established the presence of a developing motor neuron-like neurotrophin receptor profile (p75NTR, TrkB and TrkC), a genetic marker of developing motor neurons, cholinergic markers, proteins regulating transport within the endosomal pathway, and additional proteins previously shown to directly interact with neurotrophin receptors, including sortilin, and the lipid raft associated ganglioside GT1b. Furthermore, evidence is provided that NSC-34 cells undergo apoptosis in response to exogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) or neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), but not brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). In addition characterization of mouse specific p75NTR antibodies is presented to establish their suitability for internalization studies without altering the binding of exogenous neurotrophins to the receptor.

Subsequent confocal microscopy examination focusing on p75NTR trafficking in Chapter 5 revealed that internalization and intracellular transport of this receptor is regulated by exogenous neurotrophins at the cell surface where ligand binding and internalization occur, and in endosomal compartments where the bulk of receptors and ligands are targeted to their specific destinations. Evidence is provided showing that p75NTR internalization is altered in the presence of NGF, NT-3, or NT-4, but not BDNF, and the receptor is diverted into non-clathrin mediated endosomal pathways in response to NGF but not BDNF. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy suggests that p75NTR recycles to the plasma membrane in a Rab4 GTPase dependent manner in the absence of neurotrophins. Addition of neurotrophins diverted p75NTR from the recycling Rab4 positive pathway, into EEA-1 positive sorting endosomes in the presence of NGF or NT-3, or lysosomal degradation in the presence of BDNF or NT-4.
 

This study clearly demonstrates the suitability of the NSC-34 cell line as an alternate in-vitro system for the study of motor neuron biology, particularly the study of neurotrophin receptor trafficking. Taken together the results represented in this study suggest for the first time, that the fate of the p75NTR receptor depends on which neurotrophin is bound. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamic mechanisms of action of p75NTR in normal neuronal function, and may also offer further insight into the potential role of neurotrophins in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neurotrophins</field><field name="subject">P75NTR</field><field name="subject">endocytosis</field><field name="subject">intracellular trafficking</field><field name="subject">motor neuron</field><field name="subject">NSC-34</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080808.115027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Matter of Urgency! Remote Aboriginal Women&#146;s Health. Examining the transfer, adaptation and implementation of an established holistic Aboriginal Well Women&#146;s Health program from one remote community to another with similar needs and characteristics.</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Jillian Mary Graham</field><field name="description">Aim:  
As a priority for Aboriginal women, in the context of worsening Aboriginal health and lack of clarity about successful strategies to address healthcare needs, this research explored successful strategies in remote Aboriginal women&#146;s health that may be transferable to another community with similar health needs. 
Methodology:  
Against a background of cultural and historical events, the study sought to identify existing strategies and frameworks for Aboriginal women&#146;s health. It uses Naturalistic Inquiry situated within the Interpretive paradigm and conceptualised within the philosophical approach of feminist and critical social theory It has examined Aboriginal health providers&#146; and women&#146;s priorities, practices, perceptions and expectations within the context of primary health care and community development principles by Participatory Action Research (PAR).
The successful elements of an established and effective Aboriginal Well Women&#146;s Health (AWWH) program from Central Australia (CA) were identified, transferred and adapted to meet the needs of a willing recipient remote community in South Australia (SA). Working together with healthcare providers from CA and SA, the adapted Well Women&#146;s Health program was implemented in an Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service collaboratively with local mainstream Community Women&#146;s health services and evaluated.
Results:  
Over a two year period, the research was evaluated through Critical Social Theory examining both the process of implementation and the impact on the Aboriginal community, analysing both qualitative and quantitative data. The AWWH program model and its principles were successfully transferred, adapted and implemented in this community. The AWWH program which included comprehensive health screening, health information and lifestyle sessions have become core business of the Aboriginal health service and an Aboriginal Men&#146;s Well Health program has also been established using the same model.
The women have found the AWWH program culturally acceptable and their attendance has steadily increased and the program has reached those women in the community who previously had never experienced a well health check. It has also identified an extremely high incidence and comorbidity of acute illness and chronic disease in diabetes, renal and dental disease, mental and social health problems that require address. 
Conclusion:  
Health programs that are well established and effective can be successfully replicated, transferred and adapted to other communities if the elements that made them successful are acknowledged and those principles are then transferred with the program to a willing community with similar needs. This program transfer has potential to save much time and developmental costs that will help to address poor Aboriginal health.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Women&#146;s Health</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Remote Health</field><field name="subject">Transfer and adaptation of successful programs</field><field name="subject">key elements of program transfer.</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070725.112610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Discovery of Interacting Episodes and
Temporal Rule Determination in Sequential
Pattern Mining</field><field name="creator">Mooney, Carl Howard</field><field name="description">The reason for data mining is to generate rules that can be used as the basis for making
decisions. One such area is sequence mining which, in terms of transactional datasets,
can be stated as the discovery of inter-transaction associations or associations between
different transactions. The data used for sequence mining is not limited to data stored
in overtly temporal or longitudinally maintained datasets and in such domains data can
be viewed as a series of events, or episodes, occurring at specific times. The problem
thus becomes a search for collections of events that occur frequently together.
While the mining of frequent episodes is an important capability, the manner in
which such episodes interact can provide further useful knowledge in the search for a
description of the behaviour of a phenomenon but as yet has received little investigation.
Moreover, while many sequences are associated with absolute time values, most
sequence mining routines treat time in a relative sense, returning only patterns that
can be described in terms of Allen-style relationships (or simpler), ie. nothing about
the relative pace of occurrence. They thus produce rules with a more limited expressive
power. Up to this point in time temporal interval patterns have been based on
the endpoints of the intervals, however in many cases the &#145;natural&#146; point of reference is
the midpoint of an interval and it is therefore appropriate to develop a mechanism for
reasoning between intervals when midpoint information is known.
This thesis presents a method for discovering interacting episodes from temporal
sequences and the analysis of them using temporal patterns. The mining can be conducted
both with and without the mechanism for handling the pace of events and
the analysis is conducted using both the traditional interval algebras and a midpoint
algebra presented in this thesis.
The visualisation of rules in data mining is a large and dynamic field in its own right
and although there has been a great deal of research in the visualisation of associations,
there has been little in the area of sequence or episodic mining. Add to this the emerging
field of mining stream data and there is a need to pursue methods and structures for
such visualisations, and as such this thesis also contributes toward research in this
important area of visualisation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">temporal logic</field><field name="subject">sequences</field><field name="subject">episodes</field><field name="subject">data mining</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070702.120306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Efficacy of Home Based Exercise Regimes for Limb Oedemas</field><field name="creator">Moseley, Amanda Louise</field><field name="description">Secondary lymphoedema and venous oedema of the limb are the consequence of an imbalance between tissue fluid infiltrate and drainage, which leads to interstitial fluid accumulation, tissue changes, limb discomfort and morbidity. Numerous conservative therapies have been developed to address some of these negative outcomes, with a proportion of these being labour and cost intensive. This makes the investigation of cost effective and easy to implement home based regimes very important. One such therapy is limb exercise, which can be beneficial for limb oedemas through changes in both interstitial pressure and calf muscle activation. Therefore, this thesis explored the benefits of different exercise regimes for limb oedema of both lymphatic and vascular origin. This was achieved through a systematic review of existing conservative therapies for limb oedemas and four clinical trials investigating the benefits of home based exercise regimes. Results demonstrated that various positive and significant outcomes could be gained from the implementation of such regimes, including improvements in both subjective and objective parameters. These results reveal how these chronic and disabling conditions can be maintained by the patient in the home environment in between health care visits. It also demonstrates how self maintenance may alleviate the burden on the health care system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">secondary lymphoedema</field><field name="subject">chronic venous insufficiency</field><field name="subject">oedema</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070314.163051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and their
roles for narrowing the development gaps in rural and remote
areas in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Nanudorn, Paisal</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a case study of a rural sub district in Thailand, develops a
network model for development and makes policy suggestions that stress the
importance of participatory governance processes. The aim of this thesis is to learn
from a limited case study and explore the extent to which ICT could bridge the gaps
in rural and remote areas and thus aid development and empower those who are
marginalized by virtue of gender inequality, poverty, lack of education and limited
access to resources. The thesis:
 - Investigates how a case study of rural and remote communities,
particularly in North Eastern Thailand, can gain more capacity to: i.)
harness and obtain the potential advantages of information and
communication technologies and ii.) promote the interconnectedness and
network partnership across public, private and community sectors.
- Describes the lack of connection across public, private and community
sectors and argues for the need to develop and promote the capacity of
individuals, groups, organizations, and institutions in these rural areas. In
this limited case study, the lack of capacity leads to an inability to use ICT
in many sectors that could support community development goals in
Thailand. Without access to or the ability to share new information and knowledge across the remote and more developed regions, it is difficult to
create success in development projects for individuals and institutions and
to mobilize and allocate tangible and intangible resources from the
workplace, family, and community. Amidst the flood of information and
knowledge globally, including within a nation itself, partnerships among
public and private sectors and other stakeholders both inside and outside a
community can play a substantial role in harnessing the new technologies
to pool information and knowledge, in order to develop the community's
capacity and people's capability to achieve their goals sustainably.
- Argues that the development gaps in these rural and remote areas could be
reduced if the people there are promoted and empowered to be significant
and active partners equally able to share and contribute information and
knowledge to others outside their communities.
The focus of the research is on the powerful knowledge brokers in the society
such as the monks, the village leaders, local government officials and the school
teachers who know about ICTs. The research focus is not the powerless who (in this
case) may not have access to ICT. The thesis points out the way in which the
powerful view the shortcomings and barriers to ordinary people having access to
computers. As such 'the gaze' (in the sense used by Foucault is upwards at the
powerful, not downwards at the powerless. 'Power and knowledge are linked'
(Foucault), according to Foucault and this thesis looks only at the way in which the
powerful see themselves.
Although I argue for participatory governance, my thesis only looks at the
powerful. This is in part as a result of my being a member of the knowledge broker
stakeholders as I am training to be a Buddhist monk and live in the temple.
My thesis makes a contribution, by studying the powerful knowledge brokers, instead
of researching the powerless. I have researched issues with the powerful as I was able
to access them, in my role as a trainee monk and because of my position in and
connections within the community. There are usually two areas in research in Thailand that are not discussed;
they are religion and the role of the state. This thesis addresses some causes or sources
of difficulties or conflicts that have occurred as a part of the obstacles for the
development in selected case study areas, in order to understand what significantly
lies underneath the difficulties.
This thesis does not engage in a discussion on the diverse needs of the
Southern region. Muslims, who live in the five southern provinces adjacent to
Malaysia, see themselves as second class citizens compared to others (in particular
Buddhists who make up about 95% of the population). This is supported by
international criticism of the handling of separatist movements.
This thesis is written from the perspective of a Buddhist monk -to- be who
lives and works in the Northern area and who is concerned with his case study area. I
have been in training to become a monk my entire life as I was brought up in the
Buddhist temple. I acknowledge that my experiences contribute to the way that I see
the world but that I have tried to be as reflexive as possible. Much of the research
draws on my role and position in the society in which I live. I have strived to
understand the wider world. To that end, I was trained in the private and public sector
in leadership skills in Bangkok Life Insurance Company and in Bangkok Business
Administration School including in Naluang Temple, Udorn Thani province. I have
been trained to work with the community leaders such as schools and local
government officers with a view to help with community development as the temple
representative.
This thesis does not argue that information and communication technologies
(ICTs), in and of themselves, are the means to achieving social justice and socioeconomic
being. Instead it argues that they can support and enable the stakeholders to
participate in decision making and greater access to information and resources
amongst and across local stakeholders - village, school, temple and local government
- in the rural areas.
I stress that if there is no political willingness and community spirit (social
capital) to support this, then information and communication technologies (ICTs) are of no value. 'Thick democracy', in the sense used by Edgar, is dependent on better
communication with all the stakeholders. Knowledge management is not about
technology alone it is about pooling and sharing ideas so that development
opportunities can be developed. Technology is the means to achieve joined-up
government. It is not an end in itself. My thesis shows how the lack of ability to work
together, and lack of willingness to cooperate amongst some players, undermine the
potential of people to access information and resources.
I argue that the geographical isolation of rural areas nowadays can be
theoretically bridged by investing in telecommunication infrastructure. It is debatable
if the state could achieve this alone. Local institutions cannot serve, help and work in
partnership with other organizations. They need to be able to work collaboratively, in
order to deal with the complexity of problems. Some temples, for instance, lack
capacity to apply the local, tacit knowledge of people that is needed for balanced
development in the community. A consequence of the isolation of local institutions, in
this case study, is that it can lead to insufficient co-operation across community,
public and private sectors. Also, it can reduce and demote institutional and social
capacity necessary for working together effectively. The aim of this thesis was to
establish to what extent ICT can bridge the gaps in rural and remote areas and thus aid
development and empower those who are marginalized by virtue of gender inequality,
poverty, lack of education and limited access to resources. At the outset the
limitations of the small sample are acknowledge and the analysis is limited to the
discussion of themes that could have potential relevance, but nevertheless the thesis
aims to
- Explore the issue of capacity building (by means of a small purposive
sample) drawn from 7 rural communities, in North Eastern Thailand;
- Consider the themes from the purposive sample to explore the potential
development role for information and communication technologies;
- Consider the extent to which the technologies (as part of a development
process) could support the creation of networks and partnership across
public, private and community sectors; and 
- Describe the themes that emerge in the small sample about the lack of
connection across (public, private and community) sectors and argue for
the need to develop and promote the capacity of individuals, groups,
organizations, and institutions in this purposive sample.
The lack of capacity in this small sample indicated that in these communities
there is limited capacity to use ICT in many sectors that could support community
development goals in this part of Thailand. Perhaps the themes that are evident in this
sample could be explored further to assess their more general relevance. It is possible
that without access to or the ability to share new information and knowledge across
the remote and more developed regions, it is difficult to create success in development
projects for individuals and institutions and to mobilize and allocate tangible and
intangible resources from the workplace, family, and community. Amidst the flood of
information and knowledge globally, including within a nation itself, partnerships
among public and private sectors and other stakeholders both inside and outside a
community can play a substantial role in harnessing the new technologies to pool
information and knowledge, in order to develop the community's capacity and
people's capability to achieve their goals sustainably. I argue that the development
gaps in these rural and remote areas could be reduced if the people there are promoted
and empowered to be significant and active partners equally able to share and
contribute information and knowledge to others outside their communities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">ICTs</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">communications technology</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">rural areas</field><field name="subject">remote areas</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060522.145455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ACCESSIBLE MOBILE COMMUNICATION FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Toan Hieu</field><field name="description">People with disabilities are both functionally and socially disadvantaged and the lack of access to mobile communication technology adds to their disadvantage.  Changes and benefits we have seen in our society with the advent of mobile phones and associated electronic communication for people without disabilities have not migrated to people with disabilities. The comprehensive communication capability of a mobile phone can enable users anywhere to independently access a very wide range of communication, information and control systems and services. This research has addressed the key accessibility issues faced by people with disabilities who need or want to use the mobile phone for voice and data communication.

The research revealed that:
&#239;&#191;&#189; there exist accessible features on mobile phones that can better assist people with disabilities in using the phone;
&#239;&#191;&#189; through education and training, people with disabilities can develop or be provided with effective and efficient ways to access and use the phone;
&#239;&#191;&#189; current, off-the-shelf telecommunications equipment such as car kits, speakerphone, voice recognition technology, wireless connectivity capability on mobile phones can enable people with disabilities, even severe physical disabilities, to access the telecommunications network and services; and
&#239;&#191;&#189; with a suitable interfacing system in place, Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device users can operate the phone for voice and data communication, which previously had not been possible.

Trials established that people with a range of physical disabilities can use and should have equal access to telecommunications equipment and services.  This research has shown that, with the right policies, processes and support through equipment matching, education, training and delivery, current off-the-shelf solutions can help people with disabilities to effectively communicate with other members of our society and to access the same range of information systems and services enjoyed by able-bodied members of the community.

An interfacing system has been developed to provide users of AAC technology with the ability to use a mobile phone for voice calls and text messaging (SMS).  It is confidently predicted that other features and services on the phone such as speakerphone, digital camera and FM radio, email and internet-based applications, and local or remote appliances and devices, can be controlled via the AAC device.  

Outcomes and findings have confirmed the main hypothesis of the thesis that, despite very limited mobility, speed, accuracy and vocal communication ability, users will be able to successfully operate the mobile phone itself, and use it for various modes of bidirectional communication with systems to which they choose to connect.

The overall outcomes of the research have established that the benefits and usefulness of the mobile phone are so significant that they should become a necessity for people with a disability.  It has been successfully demonstrated that, with the proper mechanisms and educational programs in place, the provision of accessible mobile phones for people with disabilities can significantly improve their quality of life through increased range of accessible activities, and will improve their independence, engagement with their peers, safety, security and self-esteem.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mobile phone</field><field name="subject">telephone</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">telecommunications access</field><field name="subject">independence</field><field name="subject">Bluetooth</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">trial</field><field name="subject">survey questionnaire</field><field name="subject">focus group</field><field name="subject">GSM</field><field name="subject">AT commands</field><field name="subject">interface</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060331.111126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Morphosyntax and Oral Narrative in the Differential Diagnosis of Specific Language Impairment</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Wendy Maureen</field><field name="description">Against the background of a broad range of language features that are identified as characteristic of specific language impairment (SLI), some researchers have identified a narrower set of clinical markers considered the hallmark of SLI. However, comparisons with language impairments that fall outside the criteria for SLI are limited. This thesis is concerned with determining which language features, if any, are capable of differentiating children with SLI from children with non-specific language impairment (NLI). 
Conversation and oral narrative language samples were collected from seventy five children aged 2 &#189; to 6 years comprising four research groups: 21 participants with SLI, 13 participants with NLI, 21 age-matched participants with normally developing language (AM) and 20 younger language-matched participants with normally developing language (LM). Matching for group comparisons required that the SLI and NLI groups had similar levels of language ability on a standardised assessment and mean length of utterance (MLU), which reduced the SLI group to 15 participants for these comparisons. The LM group was also matched to the SLI and NLI groups on MLU. A wide range of language variables from the conversation and narrative samples were analysed, covering the domains of general sample measures, morphosyntactic accuracy and complexity, narrative structure and cohesion.
The SLI and NLI groups performed similarly in all domains and could not be differentiated diagnostically on the measures examined. The most consistent group effects were for comparisons between the AM and LM groups, which demonstrated the effects of maturation and development. The language impairment (LI) and LM groups could not be differentiated on the majority of general language sample or morphosyntactic measures but the SLI group produced narratives that were structurally more complex and cohesive than the LM group.
Language tasks varied in their effectiveness in differentiating groups. More consistent group effects for the grammatical accuracy measures were obtained from the conversations than the narratives, and from composite measures compared to individual morpheme measures. Targeted elicitation tasks were more effective than the conversations or narratives in producing consistent group effects for accuracy of individual verb tense morphemes. More consistent group effects for the narrative features were obtained from a wordless picture book than a single scene picture. A set of discriminant function analyses showed that LI was most effectively identified using a combination of key morphosyntactic measures from the conversations and key narrative feature measures from the two narratives.
The results have implications for diagnostic practices, intervention practices and theoretical constructs and explanations of SLI and NLI. In particular, a broad, holistic view of LI is supported, as an impairment that impacts on all domains of language which interact with each other and must be considered collectively, rather than as individual, splintered skills.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="subject">language impairment</field><field name="subject">SLI</field><field name="subject">NLI</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070220.174901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Rolling Oil Decomposition Deposits on the Quality of 55Al-43.4Zn-1.6Si Alloy Coatings</field><field name="creator">Pillar, Rachel Joanne</field><field name="description">Uncoated defects in hot dip metal-coated steel products result from non-wetting of the steel surface by the molten alloy. The occurrence of uncoated defects is highly detrimental to product quality and production efficiency; uncoated defects compromise the appearance and anti-corrosion performance of hot dip metal-coated steel products and causes time delays in the application of subsequent surface treatments. Although many studies have been directed towards evaluating the effect of steel pre-heat temperature and oxidation on the formation of uncoated defects, fewer investigations have analysed how oil-derived residues remaining on steel surface following the cold rolling and furnace cleaning processes impact upon hot dip metallic coating quality. Furthermore, although a considerable amount of research has focussed on the process of deposit formation in lubricants used in other applications, the composition of oily residues remaining after the continuous annealing process, and the origins of these residues in the original rolling oil formulation, are poorly understood.

The primary focus of the present work has been to gain an improved understanding of relationships between cold rolling oil composition, oil residue-formation characteristics and the occurrence of uncoated defects in 55Al-43.4Zn-1.6Si hot dip metallic coatings. Several key classes of rolling oil ingredients which decompose to leave high levels of thermally-stable residue have been identified. The thermal decomposition processes undergone by a variety ingredients within these classes have been studied under both oxidising and reducing conditions using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Pressure Differential Scanning Calorimetry (PDSC) techniques, with chemical characterisation of the decomposition process and the resultant thermally-stable residue by infrared spectroscopy. Model blends of each ingredient in a typical cold rolling oil base ester have also been evaluated by TGA and PDSC to identify the impact of ingredient concentration and chemical structure on the amount of oily residue formed. The results of these investigations have been related to the impact of the ingredients on 55Al-43.4Zn-1.6Si hot dip metallic coating quality through the performance of industrial-scale hot dipping trials and hot dip simulation studies.
 
In order to translate these results into a context more closely aligned with industrial conditions, the effect of processing variables, including furnace atmosphere and the availability/concentration of iron in contact with the rolling oil at the steel surface, on the decomposition process of a fully-formulated commercial cold rolling oil has also been investigated. The information gained can potentially be used to tailor operating conditions within the cold rolling/continuous hot dip metallic coating processes to enhance steel surface cleanliness.
 
Finally, the deposit-forming tendencies of an array of different commercial cold rolling oils have been evaluated, leading to the development of a thermal analysis-based test for screening cold rolling oils with respect to their likely impact upon 55Al-43.4Zn-1.6Si hot dip metallic coating quality. This test, together with the understanding obtained on the effect of different rolling oil ingredients on hot dip metallic coating quality, can be used within the industry to formulate improved cold rolling oils.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rolling oil</field><field name="subject">esters</field><field name="subject">hot dip metallic coating</field><field name="subject">thermogravimetric analysis</field><field name="subject">pressure differential scanning calorimetry</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080108.132120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essential Features of Wisdom Education in Baha'i Schooling</field><field name="creator">Pourshafie, Tahereh</field><field name="description">This thesis explores wisdom education, in theory and practice, at a Bah&#225;&#146;&#237;-inspired
school. As background for this research, the thesis investigates the concept of
wisdom, taking into account representative voices from philosophy (Socrates),
psychology (Sternberg) and Biblical studies (Proverbs), and undertaking a detailed
analysis of wisdom as a central idea in Bah&#225;&#146;&#237; thought and Bah&#225;&#146;&#237; education.
The data for the research into Bah&#225;&#146;&#237; education was collected at Nancy Campbell
Collegiate Institute (NCCI), a Bah&#225;&#146;&#237;-inspired school committed to wisdom
education. NCCI, located in Stratford, Canada, provides a solid foundation for
education through the twin pillars of &#145;achieving academic excellence&#146; and a &#145;clear
moral framework&#146;. NCCI asserts that the centre of the educational experience is their
commitment to nurturing and inspiring qualities of the spirit, emphasizing that the
spiritual life of their students is an important element of their overall development.
The data collected was analysed through the strategies and techniques of interpretive
ethnography in educational research. The sources for generating the data were:
participant observation, interviews and document/curriculum analysis.
After critical analysis of the data, it became apparent that wisdom in this school is
understood to be more than knowledge and experience. Wisdom is an educational
process involving:
&#183; An innate capacity within each individual to become wise.
&#183; The stimulus of this innate wisdom capacity through exploring fields of both spiritual
and material knowledge.
&#183; An acquired understanding of these spiritual and material worlds that increases the
potential for good in individual and collective lives.
&#183; Making informed and beneficial moral and life decisions based on this acquired understanding, which becomes an integral part of the person&#146;s life experience.
&#183; Reflection on decisions made and actions taken, which enables the individual to gain a
new level of understanding for seeking knowledge and making better decisions.
Also, it became apparent that the acquisition of wisdom is more than seeking
knowledge from the elders, God and the environment. There was a strong consensus
amongst the informants that education is a vital instrument to stimulate the
development of the innate wisdom in their students. This was evident by the way the
school emphasised the implementation of the 19 Moral Capabilities (Appendix
Three) and promoted spiritual awareness, employed the technique of consultation,
implemented the concept of mentorship, upheld the principle of Unity in Diversity,
and used performing arts through dance and theatre workshops to enhance social,
moral and spiritual understandings.
The model of wisdom education investigated in the research undertaken in this thesis
offers a valuable model for exploring wisdom education in a wide range of
contemporary schools in Australia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wisdom</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">Baha'i</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070727.144412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design Patterns in Learning to Program</field><field name="creator">Porter, Ronald</field><field name="description">This thesis argues the case for the use of a pattern language based on the basic features of the programming language used in instruction for the teaching of programming. We believe that the difficulties that novices are known to have encountered with the task of learning to program ever since the inception of computers derive from a basic misfit between the language used to communicate with a computer, the programming language, and the way that humans think. The
thrust of the pattern language idea is that patterns are the essential element in understanding how the mind words in that they are the source of that relationship that we call `meaning'. What an entity or event `means' to us derives from the effect that it has on us as living biological beings, a relationship that exists in the `real world', not from any linguistic relationship at the symbolic level.
Meaning, as a real world relationship, derives from the patterns of interactions that constitute being. The meaning that an entity has for an individual is more than can be expressed in a formal definition, definitions are matters of agreement, convention, not the pattern of experience that the individual has acquired
through living. What is missing for a novice in any skill acquisition process is meaning, the pattern of experience. All that we can give them using a formal linguistic system like a programming language is definitions, not meaning. Pattern language is the way that we think because it exists at that fundamental level of experience as living beings. The patterns of experience become the patterns of thought through recurrence, not through definition. But this takes time, so in
presenting new material to a person trying to learn, we have to present it in the form of a pattern language, the 'cognitive map' that drives the problem solving process. Creativity is always a function of combining ideas, what is really being created is new meaning, not a program, or a house, or a poem, or a sculpture - these things are mere implementations of meaning. Ultimately meaning can derive only from experience, the pattern of life around us, so creativity is the language of experience, pattern language. The mind is the product of experience, creativity its modus operandi.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">programming</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="subject">pattern language. learning to program</field><field name="subject">novice programmer</field><field name="subject">cognitive map</field><field name="subject">problem solving</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20061127.153554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fatty acid metabolism in HepG2 cells: Limitations in the accumulation of docosahexaenoic acid in cell membranes</field><field name="creator">Portolesi, Roxanne</field><field name="description">The current dietary recommendations for optimal health are designed to increase our intake of two bioactive omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), abundant naturally in fatty fish such as salmon.  Health authorities recommend that the general population consume two to three fatty fish meals per week (1) for optimal health and for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.  However, some modern Western societies consume only modest amounts of fish and seafood (2;3).  Land based vegetable oils may provide an alternative to meet these needs.  Linseed and canola oils are rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3) (4).  ALA can be converted endogenously to EPA and DHA and suggests that increasing the dietary intake of ALA may increase the conversion and accumulation of DHA in tissues and plasma.  However, elevated dietary intakes of ALA in animals and humans results in an increased level of EPA in tissues yet there is little or no change in the level of DHA (5-7).  The current consensus is that the synthesis of DHA from ALA in humans is limited yet the mechanisms involved in regulating the accumulation of DHA in tissues are poorly understood.

The reputed rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of fatty acids is delta 6 desaturase (D6D).  ALA is a substrate for D6D and undergoes a series of desaturation and elongation reactions to yield n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids  (LCPUFA).  The final step in the synthesis of DHA from ALA involves translocation of its immediate fatty acid precursor, 24:6n-3 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the peroxisome to be partially beta-oxidised to yield DHA.  The involvement of multiple enzymes in the desaturation-elongation pathway, and the integration of other pathways, such as phospholipid biosynthesis, suggests there are various steps that may regulate the accumulation of DHA in cell membranes.  This thesis aimed to examine the possible regulatory steps in the conversion of fatty acids to LCPUFA, particularly in the synthesis of DHA from n-3 fatty acid precursors.

The human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was used as an in vitro cell system to examine the accumulation of individual fatty acids and their metabolites in isolation from other competing fatty acid substrates.  The accumulation of linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) and ALA in HepG2 cell phospholipids following supplementation with increasing concentrations of each respective fatty acid correlated with that described in vivo, as was the accumulation of their conversion products.  The accumulation of DHA in cells supplemented with ALA reached a plateau at concentrations above 5 micro g/ml and paralleled the accumulation of 24:6n-3 in cell phospholipids, suggesting that the delta 6 desaturation of 24:6n-3 was prevented by increasing concentrations of ALA, thereby limiting the accumulation of DHA.  The accumulation of DHA in cells supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) or docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-3) was significantly greater than the level of DHA that accumulated in cells supplemented with ALA.  However, regardless of substrate, the level of DHA in cell membranes reached a plateau at substrate concentrations above 5 micro g/ml.  

This thesis further aimed to examine the effect of fatty acid supplementation on the mRNA expression of D6D in HepG2 cells.  The expression and activity of D6D mRNA is subject to nutritional and hormonal regulation.  The mRNA expression of D6D in HepG2 cells following supplementation with oleic acid (OA, 18:1n-9), LA, ALA, arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) or EPA was examined by real time RT PCR.  The expression of D6D mRNA was reduced by up to 50% in cells supplemented with OA, LA, ALA , AA or EPA compared with control cells and suggests that fatty acids modulate the expression of the key enzyme involved in the conversion of fatty acids.  

The effect of fatty acid co-supplementation on the fatty acid composition of HepG2 cell phospholipids was also examined in an attempt to gain insights into the role of D6D and the enzymes involved in peroxisomal beta-oxidation on the accumulation of DHA from n-3 fatty acid precursors.  The reduction in the accumulation of DHA in cells co-supplemented with DPA and docosatetraenoic acid (DTA, 22:4n-6) was greater than in cells co-supplemented with DPA and LA, suggesting that peroxisomal beta-oxidation may have a greater role in determining the accumulation of DHA from DPA than the activity of D6D.  Further investigation should be directed towards understanding the role that peroxisomal beta-oxidation may play in the synthesis of DHA from precursor fatty acids.

The fatty acid composition of cell membranes in vivo is a result of several physiological processes including dietary intake, phospholipids biosynthesis and fatty acid conversion as well as catabolic processes.  This thesis demonstrates that a greater understanding of the regulation of the conversion of fatty acids will help to define dietary approaches that enhance the synthesis of n-3 LCPUFA from n-3 fatty acid precursors to lead to improved outcomes for health.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fatty acid</field><field name="subject">beta-oxidation</field><field name="subject">delta 6 desaturase</field><field name="subject">conversion of fatty acids</field><field name="subject">HepG2 cells</field><field name="subject">phospholipids</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070802.103146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of stream and groundwater exchange using environmental tracers</field><field name="creator">Pritchard, Jodie Lee</field><field name="description">Regions of surface water and groundwater exchange are major sites for the transfer and transformation of solutes and nutrients between stream and subsurface environments. Conventional stream and groundwater exchange investigations are limited by methodologies that require intensive field investigations and/or the set-up of expensive infrastructure. These difficulties are exacerbated where hydraulic gradients are very low and stream discharge highly variable. This thesis uses a suite of environmental tracers (Cl-, Rn-222, H-2 &amp; O-18, Sr-87/Sr-86) to characterise the extent of stream and groundwater exchange between a sand bed stream and adjacent alluvial aquifer in a subtropical catchment (the Wollombi Brook) of eastern Australia. The aims were to identify sources and relative contributions of different sources of groundwater to stream discharge and specifically to improve the methodology of using Rn-222 to obtain quantitative estimate of groundwater fluxes.
The sensitivity of the Rn-222 technique for identifying groundwater discharge based on the Rn-222 concentration in stream water was improved via an iterative numerical approach to account for Rn-222 loss from stream water via turbulent gas exchange and radioactive decay. Optimal distances between stream sampling points for defining the magnitude of groundwater discharge to stream flow based on Rn-222 concentrations in stream water is a function of average stream velocity and water depth. The maximum allowable distance between sampling points for determining the magnitude of groundwater discharge to the Wollombi Brook was 2 km. This work showed that groundwater discharged to all reaches of the Wollombi Brook during baseflow and flood recession conditions. Alluvial groundwater contributed less than 30% of water to stream flow in the mid Wollombi Brook catchment.
Dilution of steady-state Rn-222 concentrations measured in transects from the stream to the alluvial sediments showed that significant surface water and groundwater exchange occurs even when gradients between surface water and groundwater are low. Lateral stream water influx to the adjacent alluvial aquifer was more extensive in the lowland areas of the Wollombi Catchment during low flow than flood recession conditions. Extensive stream water influx to the adjacent alluvial aquifer occurs contrary to the net direction of surface water and groundwater flux (as indicated by hydraulic gradients toward the stream channel). The rate of stream and groundwater exchange within the adjacent alluvial aquifer appears to be greatest during baseflow conditions. Fresh alluvial groundwater appeared to provide a buffer against higher salinity regional groundwater discharge to the alluvial aquifer in some reaches of the Wollombi Brook catchment. Pumping of the alluvial aquifer and diversions of surface water may jeopardise the water quality and volume of the alluvial aquifer and induce water flow from the regional aquifer toward the stream, potentially salinising the fresh alluvial aquifer and subsequently the stream.
The change in the Cl- concentration and the variation in slope of the deuterium &#239;&#191;&#189; oxygen-18 line between consecutive stream sampling points could be used to differentiate between regional and alluvial groundwater discharge to stream flow. Incorporating this information with three-component end-member mixing using [Sr2+] and Sr-87/Sr-86 showed that stream and alluvial groundwater exchange within the stream channel was highest in the lowland floodplains during low flow conditions. The least stream and alluvial groundwater exchange occurred in the low streambed gradient mid reaches of the Wollombi Brook regardless of stream stage. The greatest difference in the degree of stream and alluvial groundwater exchange between high and low stream stages occurred in the lowland floodplains of the Wollombi Brook.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface water and groundwater interaction</field><field name="subject">stable isotopes of water</field><field name="subject">radon-222</field><field name="subject">strontium isotopes</field><field name="subject">chloride</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060407.122526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lipschitz and commutator estimates, a unified approach.</field><field name="creator">Potapov, Denis</field><field name="description">The subject of the thesis is the study of operator functions in the setting of symmetric operator spaces.

Far-field forcing is included with open-sea boundary parameterisation of residual sea-level representing both the South Australian Current and the East Australian Current. Lagrangian and Eulerian tracer methods are used to derive transport timescales, such as age, residence times and flushing times. These are used to examine and summarise model predictions and as a diagnostic tool in sensitivity studies. 

Currents, sea-level and water mass properties in the model compare favourably with previous studies and observations, despite limitations in the model and in the data used for comparison. The seasonal cycle, in model results, is characterised by formation of a shallow (&lt; 20 m) saltier surface-layer in late spring to summer and subsequent downward mixing and erosion of the salinity field in autumn to winter with water mass from the west. This leaves behind water mass with positive age and salinity anomalies in areas of low flushing. In late winter-early spring most parts of this water mass leave the Strait interior. These areas are thought to be related to the source water of the Bass Strait Cascade. The residual circulation in all model experiments is shown to be related to seasonal-mean sea-level anomalies, arising from both barotropic and baroclinic adjustment, both in and surrounding the Strait.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bass Strait</field><field name="subject">water properties</field><field name="subject">seasonal climatology</field><field name="subject">oceanographic modelling</field><field name="subject">transport timescales</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070831.093503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superelastic Electron Scattering from Caesium</field><field name="creator">Slaughter, Daniel Stephen</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an experimental study of superelastic electron scattering from
the 6^2P_3/2
 state of caesium. The present status of electron-atom collision studies is
initially reviewed and the motivation behind the current work is then presented. A
description of the theoretical framework is subsequently provided in the context of
the present experimental study, followed by an overview of the several theoretical
approaches for describing electron-atom interactions which are currently available.
The apparatus and experimental setup used throughout the project are also described
in detail. Technical specifications and data are provided, including diagrams (where
appropriate) for a laser frequency locking system, electron gun and spectrometer,
atomic beam source and data acquisition system. The experimental procedures are
explained and discussed, including a detailed analysis of the optical pumping
process required to excite the atomic target. A substantial component of this project
was to address several potential sources of systematic error and to reduce these
wherever possible. All of the errors and uncertainties relevant to the experiment are
discussed in chapter 5.
In chapter 6 the results of the present superelastic electron scattering experiments are
reported for incident electron energies of 5.5eV, 8.5eV and 13.5eV, corresponding
to superelastic electron energies of 7eV, 10eV and 15eV. These results are presented
as three reduced Stokes parameters, P1, P2, P3 and a coherence parameter, P+ . For
comparison, predictions from a number of currently available theories are presented alongside the experimental results. Finally, conclusions are drawn on this work in the context of the current status of electron-atom scattering from alkali-metals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electron scattering</field><field name="subject">superelastic electron scattering</field><field name="subject">inelastic electron scattering</field><field name="subject">caesium</field><field name="subject">superelastic</field><field name="subject">electron</field><field name="subject">atom</field><field name="subject">collisions</field><field name="subject">atomic physics</field><field name="subject">optical pumping</field><field name="subject">laser excitation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20071009.100421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Redefining the Local: the social organisation of rural space in South Australia, 1982-2006</field><field name="creator">Smailes, Peter John</field><field name="description">This thesis brings together  a series of existing and ongoing pieces of research, conducted over a period of some years.  There are five  primary aims.
The first is to construct a coherent empirical picture of  the social organisation of space in rural South Australia by the early 1980s,  at the outset of a period of turmoil and rapid change.  The second is to bring together two relevant but disparate levels of theory (globalisation/structural change and localism/place attachment), to understand the impact of the rural crisis of 1984-94 on rural communities, families and individuals. The third is to trace the context and development of the crisis itself, the resultant poverty, demographic change, and reduced socio-economic viability of communities.  Fourthly, the theoretical and empirical findings are applied to the search for an altered accommodation between society and space, through which a modified and regrouped but still essentially intact rural society  can  survive beyond the crisis.  Finally,  I reflect on the methodological contribution and limitations of the thesis, and also on the ethical concerns and values confronting an academic researcher reporting on a local- or micro-level social tragedy, concealed and rationalised by national macro-level success.

Chapter 1 deals with fundamental concepts and epistemology.
Chapter 2 sketches the evolution of the South Australian rural habitat up to the 1980s.
Chapter 3 examines macro-level theory on globalisation in the structuralist and political economy traditions, which seek to explain the forces changing the politico-economic ground rules within which rural communities have to operate.
Chapter 4 examines theory relating to the world of the individual  person and his/her most immediate social reference groups - family, neighbourhood and community.  It presents a model of place-making, and evaluates the contributions of various disciplines towards understanding specific aspects of this process, particularly rural sociology, social and humanistic geography, structuration theory and theory relating to human territoriality.
Chapter 5 reveals how individuals and local social groups actually occupied space and developed place-attachment in rural South Australia in the early 1980s.  It draws on field studies carried out between 1979 and 1986, and on a 1982-83 postal sample survey of 2000 rural households.
Chapter 6 traces the course of a decade of almost continuous rural crisis, from about 1984.  It shows how the global economy and political decisions (international, national and State) flowed through to rural people and places. Demographic and economic impacts are examined at State level, with a regional example.
Chapters 7 (quantitative) and 8 (qualitative) examine the changes wrought by the crisis on rural society and the social organisation of space.  They draw on a 1992/93 replication of the previous postal survey to demonstrate the persistence and continuity of major features of the rural society, but also the fragility of the current spatial organisation.  The widespread rural poverty in the early 1990s and its impact on the state of rural morale are demonstrated, along with perceived changes in key community characteristics, and divergence of the economic from the social organisation of rural space.
Chapter 9 assesses requirements for a socially sustainable rural Australia, in the light of the last ten years&#239;&#191;&#189; developments in rural research.  It argues the need for the focus of localism to be re-defined upwards from individual community to regional level
Finally in Chapter 10, I reflect on the contribution and limitations of the thesis, and on the wider problem of the role academics could, should and do play in relation to the deeply meaningful social transformations we purport to study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">rural communities</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">place-bonding</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">localism</field><field name="subject">mapping community</field><field name="subject">rural crisis</field><field name="subject">regional planning</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20061005.151832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Management of Australian Corporate Philanthropy
Perspectives of Donors and Managers
A Study of Motivations and Techniques</field><field name="creator">Smith, Patricia Dawn</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to extend knowledge about corporate philanthropy in Australia, including the conduct of fundraising and funds management, looking especially at motivations for giving and techniques employed. It follows and builds on the researcher's MA work on Corporate Philanthropy in Australia: Principles and Practice (see Appendix I) and has generated new theories that may be tested in the marketplace by both individuals and groups involved in fundraising and fund management throughout Australia, and perhaps beyond.
	The study is based on a method melded together by the researcher from variations on participatory action research, action inquiry and cooperative inquiry. An extensive literature review explored material provided by participants along with material already in the public domain. The data set obtained from this exercise enabled the development of the range of questionnaires put before the participants. 
	Personal interviews were conducted with individuals, representatives of companies, trusts and foundations, and recipient organisations, along with professionals from Philanthropy Australia. The aim was to hold a discussion with the most senior person possible in every case and that aim was achieved with willingness to participate a strong factor throughout. A focus group conducted with professional fundraisers provided a point of view from 'the other side'.
	The rigour of the work stems from the representative involvement of all interested parties. The researcher's long involvement in the fundraising industry was a strong enabling factor with iteration of all interviews confirming the findings and mitigating against undue influence from that background.
	It was clear early in the study that there was difficulty in separating individual motivations from corporate motivations, as the individual beliefs and experiences spilled over into corporate involvements. For some the motivation was that philanthropy was the price of doing business, although the gifts might be directed to projects of lifetime interest to the participants. Some companies were clear about the direction of their corporate philanthropy into the communities in the areas where they operate, while others were still developing policy. Some representatives preferred to name their giving as 'social activism' rather than 'philanthropy'. A template has been developed to assist informed decision making about gifts.
	Participants spoke of a variety of techniques of giving employed under the umbrellas of the Triple Bottom Line, the Third Way, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and corporate sustainability. Those techniques include direct gifts or grants, sponsorships, strategic or venture philanthropy, Cause-Related Marketing (CRM), workplace giving or payroll deduction, bequests, and fundraising events. It was noted that workplace giving is growing. 
	Changes to Australian tax laws have made it sensible for individuals and some companies to develop Prescribed Private Funds, while others have opted for corporate trusts or foundations, or board committees. CEOs seem not to be as powerful in gift decision making as was found in the earlier MA study.
	Several clear trends were identified, one related to companies making fewer larger grants, rather than many small ones. A further trend is for companies, trusts and foundations, and individuals to seek out recipient organisations for themselves, in accordance with their areas of interest and grants priorities. This changes the scenario for fundraisers who must find new ways of gaining the attention of grant and gift makers. A third trend is to require outside evaluation of projects and assessment of project progress. None of the participants in the study indicated that they carry out policy research before making gifts. Likewise not all givers indicated regular reporting requirements.
	Community foundations are growing with new ones being developed during the course of the study. At the same time some organisations are allowing voting rights to donors, and shareholders are becoming more vocal about corporate giving.
	Gaps in welfare funding vary considerably with many charities relying on companies, trusts and foundations and individuals to 'plug the gaps'. 
	The concept of 'social capital' is explored and a new definition put forward. It is revealed that the term is capable of holding many different meanings. It was clear that durable networks are almost vital to the development of social capital.
	The gap in their understanding of corporate philanthropy between givers and receivers revealed by the MA study was found still to exist, although the whole process was found to be more open with the commercial confidentiality cited in the earlier study not appearing as a strong factor in this study, particularly as much material was available from the World Wide Web.
	In the end, the area of corporate philanthropy may still be considered to be almost 'virgin territory' thus providing a fertile field for aspiring researchers. Suggestions are provided for a number of areas of future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate philanthropy</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">fundraising</field><field name="subject">motivation</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060523.132142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of foot reflexology on reducing blood pressure in patients with hypertension</field><field name="creator">Somchock, Jeranut</field><field name="description">Background
The incidence of hypertension is increasing in developing countries such as Thailand
(Chaiteerapan et al 1997; Ministry of Public Health 2001; National Library of
Thailand Cataloguing in Publication Data 2001) as a result of sociological, political
and economic changes. These changes are producing enormous alterations in
people&#239;&#191;&#189;s lifestyles, following similar trends in western countries (National Economic
and Social Development Board 1997). Negative changes in food consumption,
alcohol consumption, level of physical activity, smoking, stress and tension have led
to an increase in chronic health problems for Thai people (National Economic and
Social Development Board 1997). Age, gender, ethnicity, genetic background,
family health history and hyperlipidaemia are likely to influence hypertension
(Kaplan, Lieberman &amp; Neal 2002; Mancia et al 2002; Manger &amp; Gifford 2001;
National Heart Foundation of Australia 2003).
It has been found that health care professionals and patients with chronic disease
have increased their use of complementary therapies to help relieve uncomfortable
symptoms and suffering (Long, Huntley &amp; Ernst 2001). Foot reflexology is a well
known complementary therapy which claims to help the body achieve homeostasis
(Byers 2001; Dougans 2002). It is believed that pressing specific areas on the feet
related to specific glands or organs of the body can help these glands and organs to
function at their peak, allowing the body to heal itself (Byers 2001; Dougans 2002).
The principle difference between massage or touch and foot reflexology is that foot
reflexology provides not only the relaxation effect obtained from massage or touch
is said to also improve body&#239;&#191;&#189;s immunity contributing to healing process (Byers 2001;Dougans 2002). Foot reflexology has been scientifically researched in many studies
to explore the claimed benefits (Bishop 2003; Kohara et al 2004; Oleson &amp; Flocco
1993; Siev-Ner et al 2003; Yang 2005). Some studies have supported its ability to
reduce anxiety and pain (Gambles, Crooke &amp; Wilkinson 2002; Launso, Brendstrup &amp;
Arnberg 1999; Stephenson, Dalton &amp; Carlson 2003; Stephenson, Weinrich &amp;
Tavakoli 2000). However, there has been little scientific evidence to support the
claim that foot reflexology can reduce blood pressure and serum lipids, and can
improve the quality of life in patients with hypertension (Hodgson 2000; Milligan et
al 2002; Park &amp; Cho 2004). The purpose of this study was to begin to fill this gap by
investigating the influence of foot reflexology on blood pressure, serum lipids and
quality of life.
Aim
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of foot reflexology on reducing
blood pressure in patients with hypertension. To this end, patients receiving
reflexology were compared with patients receiving a light foot massage, thus
controlling for any effects contributed by massage or touch alone.
Null hypotheses
1. There is no difference in mean blood pressure level between the foot reflexology
group and the light foot massage group at the end of four weeks of treatment.
2. There is no difference in mean low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and
triglyceride levels between the foot reflexology group and the light foot massage
group at the end of four weeks of treatment.3. There is no difference in mean quality of life scores between the foot reflexology
group and the light foot massage group at the end of four weeks of treatment.
Sample
A sample size of 128 was required to yield a power of 80%, if the difference in mean
diastolic blood pressure between the two groups was 5 mmHg. One hundred twenty
eight patients with hypertension who attended the hypertensive clinic in the medical
outpatients department of Phramongkutklao Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand were
enrolled and participated in the study.
Methods
Data collection
This study used a randomized controlled trial design. Participants were randomly
allocated into one of two groups &#239;&#191;&#189; 64 participants in the foot reflexology group
(intervention) and 64 in the light foot massage group (control). Data collection took
place over 4&#239;&#191;&#189; months between 26 July and 9 December 2004. Ethics approval was
obtained from both the university and hospital ethics committees.
Prior to randomization, participants were asked to complete a demographic data
questionnaire and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOLBREF)
(World Health Organization 1996) questionnaire. Blood was drawn to test
LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Using an intervention protocol based on
previous literature (Byers 2001), participants in the foot reflexology group received
their usual medical treatment and a 50-minute foot reflexology treatment twice a
week for four weeks. Participants in the light foot massage group received their usualmedical treatment and a 30-minute light foot massage session without pressure on
specific reflexology areas twice a week for four weeks. Blood pressure was recorded
before and after each treatment. At the end of the study, participants were asked to
complete the WHOQOL-BREF (World Health Organization 1996) again and blood
was once more drawn to test LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
Data analysis
An independent samples t-test followed by analysis of covariance was used to test for
difference in mean diastolic blood pressure between treatment groups both
unadjusted and adjusted for baseline values respectively. Descriptive statistics were
used to present the demographic data.
Results
Demographic data
Control and intervention groups were similar in gender, age, educational background,
economic factors, lifestyle characteristics, co-morbidities and medical treatments.
Demographic data which were substantially different between groups were marital
status, the length of time experiencing hypertension and the length of time having
treatment for hypertension. The study showed that fewer participants in the foot
reflexology group (57.8%) were married than in the light foot massage group
(70.3%). The foot reflexology group also had a higher rate (32.8%) of
&#239;&#191;&#189;divorced/separated/widowed&#239;&#191;&#189; compared with the light foot massage group (20.3%).
Participants in the light foot massage group had almost nine times the number of
participants who had had hypertension for more than 15 years, and almost eight times the number of participants who had been having treatment for hypertension for
more than 15 years, compared with those in the foot reflexology group.
Outcome variables
For both the unadjusted and adjusted analyses, there was no statistically significant
difference between treatment groups post-intervention.
Conclusions
The results from this study did not support the claim that foot reflexology can
decrease blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Similarly, there
was no evidence that it could improve the quality of life in patients with
hypertension.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reflexology</field><field name="subject">massage</field><field name="subject">complementary therapy</field><field name="subject">hypertension</field><field name="subject">high blood</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060529.153211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writes of Passage: a comparative study of newspaper obituary practice in Australia, Britain and the United States</field><field name="creator">Starck, Nigel</field><field name="description">Australian newspapers in recent years have increased significantly the column space devoted to obituaries. The Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian, the Age, the West Australian, the Herald Sun, the Canberra Times, the Advertiser, and the Courier-Mail now publish them in dedicated sections, often allocating an entire page to the obituary art. Their popularity in Australia follows a pattern established during the 1980s in Britain and the United States. Australian practice has been influenced in particular by developments in British journalism, which has seen a phenomenon described by the Wall Street Journal as &#145;an odd revival&#133;the rebirth of long newspaper obituaries&#146;.&#134; In its first incarnation, the obituary can be traced to the newsbooks of England which appeared in the 1660s, during the Restoration. It flowered in the 18th century, in the first daily newspapers and magazines; it grew luxuriant, and sometimes ornate, in the 19th century; it became unfashionable and fell into some general neglect in the 20th. Then, with the appointment of reformist editors and, particularly in Britain, the publication of bigger newspapers by an industry no longer subjected to labour restraint, the obituary itself experienced restoration. Though the momentum of renewed practice has been of mutual rapidity on three continents, there are some significant variations in its application. The American product generally favours a style faithful to news-writing principles so far as timing and content are concerned and is frequently expansive when relating the details of surviving family and funeral arrangements. In Britain, the emphasis is more on creative composition and a recitation of anecdotes, with less of a sense of urgency about news value and a consequent accent on character sketch. Both models, in recent years, have displayed a propensity for explicit appraisal and an increasing willingness to publish obituaries of those who have undermined, rather than adorned, society. Newspapers in Australia, while adopting the obituary with apparent fervour, have found their delivery of the product restrained by a lack of resources. Obituary desks in this country are staffed by a solitary journalist-editor. This has resulted in a reliance, often to an unhealthy degree, on contributions by readers. The tone of this material, with its intimacy of address and excess in sentiment, sits uneasily when appearing on the same page as obituaries syndicated from overseas sources. Contemporary obituary publication in the United States has been subjected to some scholarly analysis in terms of gender balance, identification of cause of death, and the demographic mix of its subject selection. This thesis, by means of a six-month content analysis, addresses such questions for the first time in an Australian context. In addition, it examines issues of style, origin and authorship. It finds that cause of death is identified much less than is the case in American obituary practice, that women are significantly under-represented, and that editing is sometimes haphazard. Nevertheless, the accumulated body of evidence points resolutely to a remarkable reinvigoration of practice in Australia&#146;s daily newspapers. The thesis, by discussing the views of specialists in the field of obituary publication, pursues mechanisms for sustaining the momentum and for improving the product.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obituary</field><field name="subject">newspaper obituary</field><field name="subject">necrology</field><field name="subject">biography</field><field name="subject">biographical journalism</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20051205.171130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Phoenix to Firehazard: Perceptions of Japanese Leadership in the Asia Pacific, 1960-2000</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Alexander John</field><field name="description">From the middle of the 1970s, an increasing amount of scholarly analysis centred around the concept of leadership in international relations at a time when US post-Second World War leadership began to decline. As a major beneficiary of this decline, Japan assumed the mantle of a replacement in the burgeoning field devoted to the study of changes in the international political economy. A major problem became the way in which the study of leadership in international relations became hostage to the singular example of the United States. The conflation between leadership on the one hand, with US interests and responsibilities on the other, rendered much of the analysis flawed. The growing disparities between the supply of international public goods and narrowly conceived US foreign policy interests undermined the overall study of international leadership.

Japan, as the country during the 1980s perceived most likely to supplant the US as the largest and most influential capitalist economy, became the centre of interest in this field. This thesis seeks to more comprehensively measure and analyse Japanese leadership in a more contextual and thorough means through the comparative use of case studies between 1960 and 2000. Through noting the differences in country and regional reactions to Japanese foreign policy, this study demonstrates that leadership perceptions are more often than not driven by national self interest rather than an ideal type of responsible leadership.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese foreign policy</field><field name="subject">international relations</field><field name="subject">international leadership</field><field name="subject">international political economy</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060830.175008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN EXPLORATION OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH 
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS COULD REDRESS 
SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 
IN EASTERN INDONESIA</field><field name="creator">Thamrin, Mardiah</field><field name="description">Indonesia achieved remarkable growth during the first 25 years of its series of Five Year Development Plans, which started in 1968. However, growth has not been well distributed across the regions, in part this is as a result of the Indonesian government development policy of a growth centre approach which has benefited &#239;&#191;&#189;Western Indonesia&#239;&#191;&#189; (Kawasan Barat Indonesia, KBI) more than &#239;&#191;&#189;Eastern Indonesia&#239;&#191;&#189; (Kawasan Timur Indonesia, KTI). Prosperity needs to be spread across Indonesian regions and needs to be more equitably shared.
	The thesis argues that government needs to search for other ways to overcome the imbalance by accelerating KTI development, to reduce this region&#239;&#191;&#189;s resentment, which may increase the risk of disintegration.  

	The central aim of this research is to describe and critically evaluate the potential usefulness of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) as a means to address the regional imbalance in economic development. It aims to make a contribution by:
1. Describing in detail the ways government decision-makers see the
	situation, in other words giving the viewpoints of the state;
2. Providing detailed transcriptions of the interpretations and opinions
 	expressed by powerful decision makers in the public and private
	sectors;
3. Demonstrating how the public, private and non-government sectors
 	operate;
4. Making the realistic point that the links across these sectors leads to both
	positive and negative outcomes; including
5. Illustrating  through examples how corruption spreads from the public
to the other sectors.

	This study examines the contributing factors to regional imbalance in Indonesia between KBI and KTI by means of a case study of policy and management challenges in KTI. It examines the current strategy used for accelerating the economic development of KTI and considers whether a new strategy of Public Private Partnerships would have relevance and can be developed and implemented to accelerate the development.
	Current strategies especially formulated for accelerating KTI economic development include:
	(i) The Policy and Strategy of the Eastern Indonesia Development Council
(ii) The Program of the Ministry for Acceleration of Eastern Indonesian Development; and
(iii) The Integrated Economic Development Zone program
However, one of the weaknesses of these policies is the lack of cooperation across government and the private sector.

	This study has found that the government strategies and policies have neither matched local needs nor the implementation of economic development. The study, based on both interviews and secondary data, demonstrates that the causes of the economic imbalance are systemic and multiple. They span not only government policies contributing to the imbalance directly and indirectly but also other factors, such as:
	(i) Systemic corruption across the public, private and non-government sectors;
	(ii) Lack of willingness to address the issues, lack of capital, lack of capable human resource and lack of infrastructure, lack of domestic and international market access, lack of communication and coordination and lack of cooperation. 
To overcome these problems, the Indonesian government together with business and the watchful eye of diverse civil society organizations need to change policies, systems, and visions for developing this region. 
	Public Private Partnerships through a mutual partnership program could be one way of accelerating the development in KTI. On the one hand there are some direct and positive consequences of this new vision, for example, the private sector sharing their knowledge, skills, funds, management and enhanced utilisation of market mechanisms to support the government in the development process. On the other hand there are many limitations to the approach such as government often accepts greater risk than is warranted, dangers of corruption and cronyism which may attend more intensive in long-term relationship and contracted services resulted in corruption and secret business influence in government. According to Transparency International, Indonesia remains one of the most corrupt nations internationally. Unless strategies are put in place to address systemic and endemic corruption and Public Private Partnerships are well managed, then the model for Public Private Partnership will only serve to exacerbate the problem. Systemic corruption also effects trust amongst stakeholders, which needs to be hand-in-hand with strategies to address &#239;&#191;&#189;demoralisation&#239;&#191;&#189; for developing prosperity. 
	Government is becoming more responsive to the private sector&#239;&#191;&#189;s needs by providing a conducive environment for investment, entrepreneurship and innovation. Public Private Partnerships could be a means to balance power between public, non-government and private sectors if there is more capacity building to enhance the competency and responsibility of the players. 
	No development solution can come about by working with only the public or the private or the community sectors or just non-government organizations. This study makes a strong case that the &#239;&#191;&#189;solutions need to be found in Partnerships&#239;&#191;&#189;. However, in exploring the complexity of the social capital of trust-based networks between people (but which also unfortunately exclude others) which are important for partnerships and, correspondingly, with partnerships being important for social capital, the researcher finds that there is no neat or simplistic partnership that can produce miraculous results. Some partnerships can be corrupt, some can lead to better life chances for local citizens, but the merits of each case need to be considered contextually. Widespread change is only likely when there is systemic change across governance arenas (public, private and non-government) and with consideration of social, cultural, political, economic and environmental factors. Instead of blaming development problems on insufficient participation or the lack of capacity of the ordinary people, the problems lie equally with the state, big business and non-government organizations. More effective managerial skills and efficient processes are needed in the governance of all these organizations while the role played by civil society is essential in making this governance accountable. Better partnerships can provide models that could inspire others to follow.

	Overall this study describes the complex problems created by poor policy making from above. The &#239;&#191;&#189;gaze&#239;&#191;&#189; (in the sense used by Foucault)  is shifted from the &#239;&#191;&#189;non-participating and incapable&#239;&#191;&#189; citizens to the &#239;&#191;&#189;ineffective and inefficient&#239;&#191;&#189; powerful. Why are ordinary people so often studied to find answers to societal or systemic problems?  The thesis argues that this is because they are easier to ask, more tolerant of the researcher, more resigned to answering a number of questions, or perhaps think it is easier to answer questioners in order to &#239;&#191;&#189;get rid of them&#239;&#191;&#189;. 
Instead this thesis probes the viewpoints of the powerful. Researcher who is interested in understanding how the state operates in Eastern Indonesia could &#239;&#191;&#189;trawl through this material&#239;&#191;&#189; in order to develop a greater understanding of the dynamics of power.
	To conclude, the researcher is first and foremost a practical person, who wishes to find solutions by creating the conditions for better partnership arrangements.

Controllers developed using these methods are designed to (i) be able to cope with large and sudden changes in the system's parameters, (ii) be robust to unmodelled dynamics, and (iii) have a fast transient response. In addition, the controllers are designed to employ a minimum number of sensor-actuator pairs, and yet pose a minimum computational demand so as to allow real-time implementation. 

A cantilever beam with magnetically clamped loads is designed and constructed as the research vehicle for evaluation of the proposed controllers. Using this set-up, sudden and large dynamic variations of the beam loading can be tested, and the corresponding changes in the plant's parameters can be observed. Modal testing reveals that the first three modes of the plant are the most significant and need to be suppressed. It is also identified that the first and third modes are spaced more than a decade apart in frequency. The latter characteristic increases the difficulty of effectively controlling all three modes simultaneously using one controller. To overcome this problem, the resonant control method is chosen as the basis for the control methodologies discussed in this thesis. 

The key advantage of resonant control is that it can be tuned to provide specific attenuation only at and immediately close to the resonant frequency of concern. Consequently, it does not cause control spillover to other modes owing to unmodeled dynamics. Because of these properties, a resonant controller can be configured to form a parallel structure with the objective of targeting and cancelling multiple modes individually. This is possible regardless of the mode spacing. In addition, resonant control requires only a minimum number of collocated sensor-actuator pairs for multi-mode vibration cancellation. All these characteristics make resonant control a suitable candidate for multi-mode vibration cancellation of flexible structures. 

Since a resonant controller provides negligible attenuation away from the natural frequencies that it has been specifically designed for, it is very sensitive to changes of a system's natural frequencies and becomes ineffective when these mode frequencies change. Hence, for the case of a dynamically loaded structure with consequent variations in mode frequencies, the resonant control method must be modified to allow tracking of system parameter changes. This consideration forms the theme of this thesis, which is to allow adaptive multi-mode vibration control of dynamically-loaded flexible structures. Three controller design methodologies based on the resonant control principle are consequently proposed and evaluated.

In the first approach, all possible loading conditions are assumed to be a priori known. Based on this assumption, a multi-model multi-mode resonant control (M4RC) method is proposed. The basis of the M4RC approach is that it comprises a bank of known loading models that are designed such that each model gives optimum attenuation for a particular loading condition. Conceptually, each model is implemented as a set of fixed-parameter controllers, one for each mode of concern. In reality, each mode controller is implemented as an adjustable resonant controller that is loaded with the fixed-model parameters of the corresponding mode. The M4RC method takes advantage of the highly frequency-sensitive nature of resonant control to allow simple and rapid selection of the optimum controller. Identification of the set of resonant frequencies is implemented using a bank of band-pass filters that correspond to the mode frequencies of the known models. At each time interval a supervisor scheme determines for each mode which model has the closest frequency to the observed vibration frequency and switches the corresponding model controller output to attenuate the mode. Selection is handled on a mode-by-mode basis, such that for each mode the closest model is selected. The proposed M4RC is relatively simple and less computationally complex compared to other multi-model methods reported in the literature. In particular, the M4RC uses a simple supervisor scheme and requires only a single controller per mode. Other multi-model methods use more complex supervision schemes and require one controller per model. The M4RC method is evaluated through both simulation and experimental studies. The results reveal that the proposed M4RC is very effective for controlling multi-mode vibration of a flexible structure with known loading conditions, but is ineffective for unmodeled loading conditions.

In the second approach, the assumption that all loading conditions are  a priori known is relaxed. An adaptive multi-mode resonant control (ARC) method is proposed to control the flexible structure for all possible (including unknown) loading conditions. On-line estimation of the structure's natural frequencies is used to update the adaptive resonant controller's parameters. The estimation of the natural frequencies is achieved using a parallel set of second-order recursive least-squares estimators, each of which is designed for a specific mode of concern. To optimise the estimation accuracy for each mode frequency, a different sampling rate suitable for that mode is used for the corresponding estimator. Simulation and experiment results show that the proposed adaptive method can achieve better performance, as measured by attenuation level, over its fixed-parameter counterpart for a range of unmodeled dynamics. The results also reveal that, for the same sequences of known loading changes, the transient responses of the ARC are slower than those of the M4RC.

In the third approach, a hybrid multi-model and adaptive resonant control is utilized to improve the transient response of the ARC. The proposed multi-model multi-mode adaptive resonant control (M4ARC) method is designed as a combination of the M4RC and ARC methods. The basis of the proposed method is to use the M4RC fixed-parameter model scheme to deal with transient conditions while the ARC adaptive parameter estimator is still in a state of fluctuation. Then, once the estimator has reached the vicinity of its steady-state, the adaptive model is switched in place of the fixed model to achieve optimum control of the unforeseen loading condition. Whenever a loading change is experienced, the simple M4RC supervisor scheme is used to identify the closest model and to load the adjustable resonant controllers with the fixed parameters for that model. Meanwhile, the mode estimators developed for the ARC method are used to identify the exact plant parameters for the modes of concern. As soon as these parameters stop rapidly evolving and reach their steady-state, they are loaded into the respective adjustable controllers. The same process is repeated whenever a loading change occurs. Given the simplicity of the M4ARC method and its minimal computation demand, it is easily applicable for real-time implementation. Simulation and experiment results show that the proposed M4ARC outperforms both the ARC with respect to transient performance, and the M4RC with respect to unmodeled loading conditions.

The outcomes of this thesis provide a basis for further development of the theory and application of active control for flexible structures with unforeseen configuration variations. Moreover, the basis for the proposed multi-model adaptive control can be used in other areas of control (not limited to vibration cancellation) where fast dynamic reconfiguration of the controller is necessary to accommodate structural changes and fluctuating external disturbances.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adaptive</field><field name="subject">active control</field><field name="subject">multi-model</field><field name="subject">multi-mode</field><field name="subject">resonant</field><field name="subject">flexible structures</field><field name="subject">frequency estimator</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070130.192707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Atmospheric freshwater sources for eastern Pacific surface salinity</field><field name="creator">Tonin, Hemerson E.</field><field name="description">The remarkable salinity difference between the upper Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is often explained through net export of water vapour across Central America. To investigate this mechanism a study of salinity signals in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean current system was made looking at responses to fresh water input from two sources (local versus remote - Atlantic Ocean) as well as a combination of the two. Statistical analyses (Empirical Orthogonal Functions, Single Value Decomposition and Wavelet analysis) were used to split the main sources of the atmospheric freshwater input into local and remote contributions and to quantify both contributions. The remote source was assumed to have been transported over Central America from the Atlantic Ocean as an atmospheric freshwater flux, whereas the local source originated in the Pacific Ocean itself. The analysis suggests that 74% of the total variance in precipitation over the tropical eastern Pacific is due to water vapour transport from the Atlantic. It also demonstrates strong influence of ENSO events, with maximum correlation at a two months time lag. During La Ni&#239;&#191;&#189;a periods the precipitation variance is more closely related to water vapour transport across Central America (the remote source), while during El Ni&#239;&#191;&#189;o periods it is more closely related to the water vapour transport by Southerly winds along the west coast of South America (the local source). The current and temperature fields provided by the Modular Ocean Model (version 2) were used to study the changes in the salinity field when freshwater was added to or removed from the model. ECMWF ERA-40 data taken from the ECMWF data server was used to determine the atmospheric flux of freshwater at the ocean surface, in the form of evaporation minus precipitation (E-P). The Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) computed from temperature and salinity fields determines to what depth the salinity's dilution/concentration takes place for every grid point. Each MLD was calculated from the results of the previous time step, and the water column was considered well mixed from the surface to this depth. The statistical relationships were used to reconstruct the precipitation over the tropical eastern Pacific. A numerical ocean model, which uses currents and temperature from a global ocean model and is forced by precipitation, was used to study the ocean's response to either the remote or the local source acting in isolation. Through time lag correlation analysis of the sea surface salinity anomalies produced by the variation in the reconstructed precipitation fields, it is found that the anomaly signals of salinity propagate westward along the Equator at a rate of approximately 0.25 m.s-1 (6.1 degrees per month).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eastern Pacific Ocean</field><field name="subject">surface salinity</field><field name="subject">ENSO</field><field name="subject">atmospheric transport of freshwater</field><field name="subject">atmospheric cells of circulation</field><field name="subject">variability of the surface salinity</field><field name="subject">coupling between the surface salinity and the ENSO cycle</field><field name="subject">coupling between the surface salinity and  the atmospheric transport of freshwater</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20061031.080144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trilinear Projection</field><field name="creator">Vallance, Scott</field><field name="description">In computer graphics a projection describes the mapping of scene geometry to the screen. While linear projections such as perspective and orthographic projection are common, increasing applications are being found for nonlinear projections, which do not necessarily map straight lines in the scene to straight lines on the screen. Nonlinear projections occur in reflections and refractions on curved surfaces, in art, and in visualisation.

This thesis presents a new nonlinear projection technique called a trilinear projection that is based on the trilinear interpolation of surface normals used in Phong shading. Trilinear projections can be combined to represent more complicated nonlinear projections. Nonlinear projections have previously been implemented with ray tracing, where rays are generated by the nonlinear projections and traced into the scene. However for performance reasons, most current graphics software uses scanline rendering, where a scene point is imaged on a screen as a function of the projection parameters. The techniques developed in this thesis are of this nature.

This thesis presents several algorithms used in trilinear projection:

1. An algorithm to analytically determine which screen locations image a given scene point.

2. An algorithm that correctly connects projected vertices. Each scene point may be imaged multiple times, which means a projected scene triangle may form from one to four different shapes of from two to nine vertices. Once connected, the projected shapes may be rendered with standard scanline algorithms.

3. An algorithm to more accurately render the curved edges between projected vertices.

4. A scene-space edge-clipping algorithm that handles continuity issues for projected shapes across composite projections.

The trilinear projection technique is demonstrated in two different application areas: visualisation, and reflections and refractions. Specifically, various nonlinear projections that are congruent with pre-existing visualisation techniques are implemented with trilinear projections and a method for approximating the reflections and refractions on curved surfaces with trilinear projections is presented. Finally, the performance characteristics of the trilinear projection is explored over various parameter ranges and compared with a naive ray tracing approach.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer graphics</field><field name="subject">nonlinear projection</field><field name="subject">reflections</field><field name="subject">refractions</field><field name="subject">rendering</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20050714.113416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power, Trust and Collaboration: A case study of unsuccessful organisational change in the South Australian health system</field><field name="creator">van Eyk, Helen</field><field name="description">Internationally, health systems have been undergoing an extended period of endemic change, where one effort at health system reform inevitably seems to lead to further attempts to make adjustments, re-direct the focus of the reform effort, or bring about further, sometimes very different changes.  This phenomenon is described as churning in this thesis.  Churning is a result of continual efforts to adjust and &#239;&#191;&#189;improve&#239;&#191;&#189; health systems to address intractable &#239;&#191;&#189;wicked&#239;&#191;&#189; problems, often through applying solutions based on neo-liberal reform agendas that have influenced public sector reform in developed countries since the early 1980s.  Consistent with this, the South Australian health system has been caught up in a cycle of change and restructuring for almost thirty years.  

This qualitative study explores a case study of unsuccessful organisational change initiated by a group of health care agencies in the southern metropolitan area of Adelaide, South Australia, which took place between 1996 and 2001.  The agencies sought to develop and establish a regional health service through a process they called &#239;&#191;&#189;Designing Better Health Care in the South&#239;&#191;&#189; which aimed to improve the way that services were provided in the area, and to enable the agencies to manage the increasing budgetary and workload pressures that they were all experiencing.  A significant policy shift at the state government level meant that this initiative was no longer supported by the central bureaucracy and could not proceed.  The agencies reverted from a focus on regional planning and service delivery to an institutional focus.

The changes that are described within the scope of the case study are universally recognisable, including centralisation, decentralisation, managerialism and integration.  The experience of Designing Better Health Care in the South as an unsuccessful attempt to implement change that was overtaken by other changes is also a universal phenomenon within health systems.  This study locates the case study within its historical and policy contexts.  It then analyses the key themes that emerge from consideration of the case study in order to understand the reasons for constant change, and the structural and systemic impediments to successful reform within the South Australian health system as an example of health systems in developed countries.  

As a case study of organisational change, Designing Better Health Care in the South was a story of frustration and disappointment, rather than of successful change.  The case study of Designing Better Health Care in the South demonstrates the tensions between the differing priorities of central bureaucracy and health care agencies, and the pendulum swing between the aims of centralisation and regionalisation.  The study uses the theory of negotiated order to understand the roles of the key themes of trust, partnership and collaboration, and power and control within the health system, and to consider how these themes affect the potential for the successful implementation of health care reform.  Through analysis of the case study, this thesis contributes to an understanding of the difficulties of achieving effective reform within health systems in advanced economies, such as the South Australian health system, because of the complex power and trust relations that contribute to the functioning of the health system as a negotiated order. 

The study is multidisciplinary and qualitative, incorporating a number of social science disciplines including sociology, political science, historical analysis and organisational theory.  Data collection methods for the study included interviews, focus groups, document analysis and a survey.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health care reform</field><field name="subject">organisational change</field><field name="subject">negotiated order</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060130.095828</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heritable influences in oxygen-induced retinopathy</field><field name="creator">van Wijngaarden, Peter</field><field name="description">Retinopathy of prematurity, a disease characterised by aberrant retinal vascular development in premature neonates, is a leading cause of blindness and visual impairment in childhood. This work sought to examine differences in the susceptibility of inbred rat strains to oxygen-induced retinopathy, a model of human retinopathy of prematurity. The overriding aim was to identify genetic factors in rats that might be generalisable to humans. 

Newborn rats of six different strains were exposed to alternating cycles of hyperoxia and relative hypoxia for fourteen days. Rats were removed to room air and killed for analysis immediately, to assess oxygen-induced retinal vascular attenuation, or four days later to evaluate the extent of hypoxia-induced vasoproliferation. Whole flat-mounted retinae were stained with fluorophore conjugated isolectin GS-IB4, and measurement of vascular area was conducted using fluorescence microscopy and video-image analysis. A hierarchy of susceptibility to the inhibitory effects of cyclic hyperoxia and relative hypoxia on postnatal retinal vascularization was identified for the rat strains studied. Susceptibility to vascular attenuation was predictive of the subsequent risk of vascular morphological abnormalities. Cross-breeding experiments between susceptible and resistant strains demonstrated that the susceptible phenotype was dominantly inherited in an autosomal fashion. These studies confirmed an association between ocular pigmentation and retinopathy risk, however the finding of differential susceptibility amongst albino rat strains implicated factors in addition to those associated with ocular pigmentation. 

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to compare the retinal expression of angiogenic factor genes in susceptible and resistant strains with the aim of identifying a genetic basis for the strain difference. Eight angiogenic factor genes were selected for study: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); VEGF receptor 2; angiopoietin 2; Tie2; pigment epithelium-derived factor; erythropoietin; cyclooxygenase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-1. The most notable difference between strains was the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) during the cyclic hyperoxia exposure period - higher VEGF expression was associated with relative resistance to retinopathy. Other differences in retinal angiogenic factor gene expression between strains, such as higher expression of VEGF receptor 2 and angiopoietin 2 in resistant strains, appeared to be secondary to those in VEGF. Following cyclic hyperoxia, the expression pattern of angiogenic factor genes changed - messenger RNA levels of hypoxia-induced genes, including VEGF, VEGF receptor 2, angiopoietin 2 and erythropoietin, were significantly higher in those strains with larger avascular areas, than in those strains that were relatively resistant to retinopathy. These findings provide firm evidence for hereditary risk factors for oxygen-induced retinopathy in the rat. Differences in the regulatory effects of oxygen on VEGF expression appear to be central to the risk of retinopathy. The potential relevance of these hereditary factors is discussed in the context of the human disease.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">retinopathy</field><field name="subject">prematurity</field><field name="subject">neovascularization</field><field name="subject">angiogenesis</field><field name="subject">retina</field><field name="subject">hypoxia</field><field name="subject">hyperoxia</field><field name="subject">inbred rat</field><field name="subject">vascular endothelial growth factor</field><field name="subject">pigment epithelium-derived factor</field><field name="subject">angiopoietin</field><field name="subject">erythropoietin</field><field name="subject">insulin-like growth factor</field><field name="subject">cyclooxygenase</field><field name="subject">Tie2</field><field name="subject">genetic trait</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060824.211102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE RETURN OF THE OBSOLESCING BARGAIN AND THE DECLINE OF &#145;BIG OIL&#146;: A STUDY OF BARGAINING IN THE

in the highly politicised oil industry. By covering the period between 1998 and early 2007,
this study focuses exclusively on contemporary bargaining in the oil industry, as it is
unfeasible to cover a longer time-span. In the current decade, which unlike previous two
cooperative decades, can be characterised as conflictual, and thus politicised, the structure
of the oil industry can best be understood by studying bargaining between numerous
actors, the main of which are the international oil companies (IOCs), oil-exporting states,
oil-importing states, and the national oil companies (NOCs). The central argument is that due to their weak relative bargaining power, the IOCs have been on the losing side in their bargaining with oil exporting countries and/or their NOCs in the current decade when compared to the late 1990s, and thus, we are witnessing the
return of the obsolescing bargain.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oil</field><field name="subject">bargaining</field><field name="subject">IOCs</field><field name="subject">NOCs</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080305.150535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Environmental Impact of Genetically Modified Crop Plants on the Microbiology of the Rhizosphere</field><field name="creator">Walter, Diana Joyce</field><field name="description">The effect of genetically modified crop plants on the microbiology of the rhizosphere was investigated using the single-gene Bt cotton as a case study. The project compared the rhizosphere microbiota of four Ingard&#174; 1cotton plant varieties that were closely matched with their non-GM parental strains. The plants were grown in
three different Australian soils, ie, a vertisol from a cotton-growing region, and two soils, a fine sandy loam and a red sand from South Australia that had not been exposed to cotton.
At the time of the commencement of the project, the only commercially available genetically modified plants were cotton and carnations. The cotton industry in Australia is worth $1.5b annually, and care of the soil and the dynamics of its living microbial consortia needs to be understood for optimum management to enable
agricultural sustainability. The general outline of the thesis incorporated four main sections:
1. Experimental setup and analysis of the soils and plants to be used, quantification of the Cry1A(c) plant-produced Bt protein, and its
persistence in the soil environment.
2. Measurement of the selected microbial populations of bacteria, fungi, AMfungi,
protozoans and nematodes, by counting and estimation by dilution and most-probable number methods.
3. Assessment of selected metabolic pathways to determine the effects on the soil microbial community by chemical and other biochemical methods
4. An overall analysis between different group ratios of expression of each of the variables tested, and the summary of the risk analysis and conclusion.

The outcome of this work was the acquisition of scientific data to produce an environmental impact report. The findings of this study showed that generally the microbial populations and the products of major metabolic pathways correlated more closely within the non-GM and GM plant rhizospheres of the paired trials than those
of separate trials, indicating that soil and plant cultivar had a stronger environmental effect. The results obtained from the paired trials did not show that there were consistent effects on the rhizosphere soil microbiota that could be attributed to the presence of the Cry1A(c) Bt plant protein on the selected strains of cotton plants.

The results from the tests of the paired trials correlate highly with previously published work that the risk factors of genetically modified cotton plants on the microbiology of the rhizosphere soil were found be negligible and not consistent across trials.

However, there is little in the scientific literature about the use of complementary therapies in the treatment regime of people with dementia. Specifically, there have been no published results of investigations into the use of Reiki, a holistic complementary therapy, in the treatment regime of people with dementia.

Before proceeding with an in-depth examination into the use of Reiki in the care of people with dementia, a questionnaire containing both closed and open-ended questions was distributed to 162 South Australian High Care Residential Facilities (formerly called Nursing Homes) in 2002. The return rate was 58.0% (n=94) of which 50.0% of the mail out (n=81) was available for analysis. Findings from the questionnaires suggested that a wide range of complementary therapies including aromatherapy, massage, music, behaviour therapy, healing touch, Reiki and Therapeutic Touch (Krieger/Kunz method) were used regularly within South Australian High Care Residential Facilities. Complementary therapies were reportedly used to calm residents, improve behaviour management, enhance the quality of life of residents, promote 1:1 interaction, stimulate the senses, and reduce the need for medication.

Due to 15 facilities reporting the use of Reiki, a series of semi-structured interviews with Reiki practitioners caring for people with dementia was conducted in 2004/2005. Interview participants (n=10) included a representative range of people providing care for people with dementia in eight Nursing Homes in Adelaide, South Australia. Data reduction methods included a quasi-statistical counting of key words and repeated re-readings of the transcripts to discover the essences, abstract the meanings and arrange them into themes and sub-themes.

The results of the interviews suggested that Reiki is an easy to learn and easy to use holistic complementary therapy which has the potential to enhance the quality of life of the persons with dementia, their family members, and their carers. The interview participants reported improved physical, psychological, mental and emotional well-being as well as enhanced relationships and a reduction in negative behaviours following the use of Reiki.

The receipt of the first Jack Loader Scholarship from the Rosemary Foundation for Memory Support Inc. in early 2005 enabled the researcher to transfer to full-time studies from April 2005.

This study examines each of these processes by investigating high-resolution ERP topography during target detection for visual word stimuli.

Method &#150; ERPs were recorded at 124 electrodes from 10 PTSD patients and 10 matched controls. Target detection tasks comprised blocks of equally probable red and blue words, with low probability target events. Detection of fixed target words in one color provided the basis for measurement of selective attention for color, stimulus evaluation and target detection processing. Alternative task instructions, with the same stimuli, required detection of any consecutive word repeats in an attended color, which demands working memory updating for nontarget words. Comparison of attended non-target words from each task indicates the extra activity for updating working memory representations of target attributes. Thus, specific condition comparisons provide measures of stimulus discrimination and evaluation, working memory updating and target detection.

Results &#150; PTSD patients had slower and less accurate motor responses in both tasks, with greater inaccuracy during the variable target task. There was abnormal ERP activity in PTSD at 200-300 ms in the left posterior temporal region during stimulus discrimination and target recognition. During evaluation of attended non-target words, PTSD patients demonstrate deficits in frontal and parietal regions at 400-500 ms. During working memory updating, at 400-600 ms, there was a delay in frontal activation, followed by smaller activity in parietal areas in PTSD. During target word recognition, PTSD patients demonstrate deficits in frontal activity, with greater occipital and parietal activity.

Conclusions &#150; These findings indicate impaired evaluation and integration of new information in working memory. In particular, the results suggest failure in frontal executive systems, with greater dependence on visual processing for effective target detection. The current findings are consistent with neuropsychology studies that identify deficits of attention and memory for verbal information in PTSD. This study provides insight into the temporal components of attention and working memory in PTSD. It is proposed that working memory deficits arise from disruption to synchronized activity in distributed networks engaged in working memory processes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anxiety</field><field name="subject">Cognition</field><field name="subject">Electrophysiology</field><field name="subject">Topographic Brain Mapping</field><field name="subject">P300</field><field name="subject">Vision</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20070702.080042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water as a Public Good in Indonesia: An evaluation of water supply service performance in an Indonesian water supply enterprise as a means to address social and environmental justice concerns</field><field name="creator">Wijaya, Andy Fefta</field><field name="description">A water supply service can be seen as a public or private good, but this thesis
makes the argument that water is vital for society and so to ensure accountability it is
important that water governance includes citizens' participation for social and

services that are provided by 'means of public policy' (Lane, 1993, p. 21), or
'collective political choice' (Stretton &amp; Orchard, 1994, p. 54) rather than by means of

is usually related to its success in achieving desired outcomes of the organization's
goals through a systemic management interaction across organizational aspects at the
input, process, output, and outcome/impact stages. This thesis argues an evaluation
model of performance measurement can be developed to reflect the characteristics of
a public good for a water supply utility, and this model of performance measurement
can assist in addressing issues of social and environmental justice.
Harris et al argue that better governance can only be achieved by working for
democracy in multiple arenas (Harriss, Stokke, &amp; Tornquist, 2004, pp. 7-8). This
study considers multidimensional performance measures taking on board the values of
many stakeholders with different backgrounds. It 'unfolds' and 'sweeps in' in many
dimensions in an attempt at systemic representation (Ulrich, 1983, p. 169). McIntyre-
Mills states that 'service need to reflect the values of the users and for this to occur the users need to participate in and decide on policy design and governance'
(McIntyre-Mills, 2003, p. 14). Performance measurement systems can be used to
detect a gap between services supplied by providers and various needs demanded by
stakeholders.
The thesis develops an outcome performance measurement model for
evaluating social equity and environmental justice concerns. It draws on and adapts
four performance measurement models of the International Water Association, World
Bank, Indonesian Home Affairs Department and Indonesian Water Supply Enterprise
Association.
A complementary combined method was developed that addresses qualitative
and quantitative governance concerns as they perform to water supply performance
problems. Three research methods were used, namely the case study, survey and
focus group discussion for collecting qualitative and quantitative data from the three
governance sectors. These were triangulated. Five research tools in the case study
method were used for collecting information from stakeholders in the three
governance sectors including interview, personal communication or email, document
analysis, direct observation and documentation. The survey was used to investigate
431 respondents from three case study locations in Cinusa1 city, and the two focus
groups were conducted in the city's water supply company management for
discussing problems of water supply performance as summarized from the survey.
The locus of this study was concentrated in the Cinusa city jurisdiction area,
and the focus was the performance problem of the water supply company in Cinusa
during 2001-2004. However, a comparative study of water supply performance
nationally and internationally is presented for analyzing relative performance gaps.This research evaluates interconnections among cost inefficiency, tariff
escalation and other non-financial performances: water supply quantity, quality,
continuity and pressure. Inefficient costs because of corrupt, collusive and nepotistic
practices in this Indonesian water supply company implicate cost burdens in the
company and prevent this water local public enterprise perform its social and
environmental missions. The Cinusa local government as the owner of this local
public enterprise and the Cinusa local parliament hold a monopoly power in some
important decisions related to this local public enterprise, including tariff policy,
senior management positions and the total amount of profit share paid to the local
government. Such customers from lower income household instead of being
subsidized as specified in the national regulation are paying at a profitable tariff and
subsidizing this enterprise's inefficiency and the government's locally generated
revenue.
The inefficiency alongside the profit sharing policy also weakens this
enterprise's capacity to invest and improve its service performances. Improving the
service performance is essential for current and potential customers and could also
benefit the society economically, socially and environmentally, besides being of
economic benefit to the enterprise itself. Securing public health concerns and
groundwater preservations can be conducted by improving the accessibility, the
availability and the reliability of water quality, quantity, pressure and continuity.
This research presents an evaluation model for improving the accountability of
water supply by means of performance management tool and it makes policy
recommendations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water supply</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">environmental justice</field><field name="subject">social justice</field><field name="subject">accountability</field><field name="subject">performance management</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20060522.144632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Discovery and Retrieval of Temporal Rules in Interval Sequence Data</field><field name="creator">Winarko, Edi</field><field name="description">Data mining is increasingly becoming important tool in extracting interesting knowledge from large databases. Many industries are now using data mining tools for analysing their large collections of databases and making business decisions. Many data mining problems involve temporal aspects, with examples ranging from engineering to scientific research, finance and medicine. Temporal data mining is an extension of data mining which deals with temporal data. Mining temporal data poses more challenges than mining static data. While the analysis of static data sets often comes down to the question of data items, with temporal data there are many additional possible relations.

One of the tasks in temporal data mining is the pattern discovery task, whose objective is to discover time-dependent correlations, patterns or rules between events in large volumes of data. To date, most temporal pattern discovery research has focused on events existing at a point in time rather than over a temporal interval.  In comparison to static rules, mining with respect to time points provides semantically richer rules.  However, accommodating temporal intervals offers rules that are richer still.  

This thesis addresses several issues related to the pattern discovery from interval sequence data. Despite its importance, this area of research has received relatively little attention and there are still many issues that need to be addressed. 
Three main issues that this thesis considers include the definition of what constitutes an interesting pattern in interval sequence data, the efficient mining for patterns in the data, and the identification of interesting patterns from a large number of discovered patterns.

In order to deal with these issues, this thesis formulates the problem of discovering rules, which we term richer temporal association rules, from interval sequence databases. Furthermore, this thesis develops an efficient algorithm, ARMADA, for discovering richer temporal association rules. The algorithm does not require candidate generation. It utilizes a simple index, and only requires at most two database scans. In this thesis, a retrieval system is proposed to facilitate the selection of interesting rules from a set of discovered richer temporal association rules. To this end, a high-level query language specification, TAR-QL, is proposed to specify the criteria of the rules to be retrieved from the rule sets. Three low-level methods are developed to evaluate queries involving rule format conditions. In order to improve the performance of the methods, signature file based indexes are proposed. In addition, this thesis proposes the discovery of inter-transaction relative temporal association rules from event sequence databases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data mining</field><field name="subject">temporal rule</field><field name="subject">interval data</field><field name="subject">sequence data</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080107.164033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LDPL: A Language Designer's Pattern Language</field><field name="creator">Winn, Tiffany Rose</field><field name="description">Patterns provide solutions to recurring design problems in a variety of domains,
including that of software design. The best patterns are generative: they show how to
build the solution they propose, rather than just explaining it. A collection of patterns
that work together to generate a complex system is called a pattern language. Pattern
languages have been written for domains as diverse as architecture and computer
science, but the process of developing pattern languages is not well understood.
This thesis focuses on defining both the structure of pattern languages and the
processes by which they are built. The theoretical foundation of the work is existing
theory on symmetry breaking. The form of the work is itself a pattern language: a
Language Designer's Pattern Language (LDPL). LDPL itself articulates the structure
of pattern languages and the key processes by which they form and evolve, and thus
guides the building of a properly structured pattern language. LDPL uses
multidisciplinary examples to validate the claims made, and an existing software
pattern language is analyzed using the material developed.
A key assumption of this thesis is that a pattern language is a structural entity; a
pattern is not just a transformation on system structure, but also the resultant structural
configuration. Another key assumption is that it is valid to treat a pattern language
itself as a complex, designed system, and therefore valid to develop a pattern language
for building pattern languages.
One way of developing a pattern language for building pattern languages would be
to search for underlying commonality across a variety of existing, well known pattern
languages. Such underlying commonality would form the basis for patterns in LDPL.
This project has not directly followed this approach, simply because very few pattern
languages that are genuinely structural have currently been explicitly documented.
Instead, given that pattern languages articulate structure and behavior of complex
systems, this research has investigated existing complex systems theory - in particular,
symmetry-breaking - and used that theory to underpin the pattern language. The
patterns in the language are validated by examples of those patterns within two well
known pattern languages, and within several existing systems whose pattern
languages have not necessarily been explicitly documented as such, but the existence
of which is assumed in the analysis.
In addition to developing LDPL, this project has used LDPL to critique an existing
software pattern language, and to show how that software pattern language could
potentially have been generated using LDPL. Existing relationships between patterns
in the software language have been analyzed and, in some cases, changes to patterns
and their interconnections have been proposed as a way of improving the language.
This project makes a number of key contributions to pattern language research. It
provides a basis for semantic analysis of pattern languages and demonstrates the
validity of using a pattern language to articulate the structure of pattern languages and
the processes by which they are built. The project uses symmetry-breaking theory to
analyze pattern languages and applies that theory to the development of a language.
The resulting language, LDPL, provides language developers with a tool they can use
to help build pattern languages.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pattern</field><field name="subject">pattern language</field><field name="subject">design pattern</field><field name="subject">software design</field><field name="subject">complex system</field><field name="subject">systems analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20061127.123254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wavelets and C*-algebras</field><field name="creator">Wood, Peter John</field><field name="description">A wavelet is a function which is used to construct a specific type of orthonormal basis.

PARTIAL CHARACTERISATION OF THE PURINERGIC RECEPTOR SUB-TYPES INVOLVED</field><field name="creator">Woods, Charmaine Michelle</field><field name="description">The sphincter of Oddi (SO) is a neuromuscular structure located at the junction of the bile and pancreatic ducts with the duodenum.  The primary functions of the SO are to regulate the delivery of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum, and to prevent reflux of duodenal contents into the biliary and pancreatic systems.  Neural, hormonal or functional disturbances of biliary motility can lead to painful and sometimes life threatening clinical conditions, such as SO dysfunction and acute pancreatitis. Clearly understanding the regulation of biliary and duodenal motility patterns is necessary and may provide useful pharmacological sites for drug development to aid in the treatment of these diseases.

Spontaneous activity of the SO is regulated by complex interactions between the enteric nervous system, hormones, possibly interstitial cells of Cajal and other bioactive agents, together with modulation via neural reflexes between the duodenum, common bile duct/gallbladder, and stomach.  Purines are one group of neurotransmitters/regulatory agents that have been shown to effect gastrointestinal motility, however their functions in the regulation of SO motility have not been elucidated.

The studies described in this thesis used in vitro organ bath techniques and in vivo preparations to determine the effects of exogenous purines on possum SO and duodenal motility. The possum SO has been extensively characterized and is an excellent model for motility studies.  In vitro, exogenous adenosine was found to decrease spontaneous activity in both the SO and duodenum.  In contrast exogenous ATP induced both excitatory and inhibitory responses in the SO and duodenum.  Interestingly, the adenosine and ATP-induced effects were predominantly exhibited by the proximal portion of the SO (proximal-SO), with no or little effect observed in the distal portion of the SO (distal-SO).  These data support the hypothesis that the SO is comprised of different functional components that can act differently in response to certain stimuli, and highlights the importance of studying each of the SO components.

Agonists and antagonists, together with immunohistochemical studies, were used in an attempt to identify the P1 and P2 receptor sub-types responsible for mediating the adenosine- and ATP-induced responses.  In the duodenum the adenosine-induced decrease in spontaneous activity was likely to be mediated by A2A and A3 receptors, but the receptors mediating the proximal-SO response could not be identified. In the duodenum ATP induced a complex non-neural response consisting of a P2X1, and P2Y2 and/or P2Y4 mediated immediate inhibition. This was followed by a return to baseline activity or small excitation.  The response concluded with a late inhibitory response, likely to be mediated by P2Y1 receptors, but the effects of other P2Y receptors could not be excluded. In contrast, ATP application to the proximal-SO evoked a partially neurally mediated early excitation, likely via P2X receptors, followed by an inhibition of activity, likely via activation of non-neural P2Y2 and/or P2Y4 receptors. 

In vivo studies with exogenous application of adenosine and ATP to the SO activated neural pathways to produce increased motor activity.  Characterisation of these neural pathways found ATP and/or adenosine to activate excitatory cholinergic motor neurons.  ATP also activated an inhibitory nicotinic/nitrergic pathway.    

This is the first comprehensive investigation of the possible involvement of purines in the regulation of SO motility.  These studies demonstrate that exogenous purines influence SO and duodenal motility, inducing complex neural and non-neural responses, acting via multiple P1 and P2 receptors.  It now remains to be determined if endogenously released purines induce similar responses, together with elucidation and location of the receptor sub-types involved.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sphincter of Oddi</field><field name="subject">motility</field><field name="subject">purines</field><field name="subject">ATP</field><field name="subject">adenosine</field><field name="subject">proximal-SO</field><field name="subject">distal-SO</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20061120.095902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BRAIN DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR TRANSPORT AND PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE</field><field name="creator">Wu, Linyan</field><field name="description">Neurotrophins are important signaling molecules in neuronal survival and differentiation. The precursor forms of neurotrophins (proneurotrophins) are the dominant form of gene products in animals, which are cleaved to generate prodomain and mature neurotrophins, and are sorted to constitutive or regulated secretory pathway and released. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a pivotal role in the brain development and in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. In Huntington&#146;s disease, the defective transport of BDNF in cortical and striatal neurons and the highly expressed polyQ mutant huntingtin (Htt) result in the degeneration of striatal neurons. The underlying mechanism of BDNF transport and release is remains to be investigated. Current studies were conducted to identify the mechanisms of how BDNF is transported in axons post Golgi trafficking. By using affinity purification and 2D-DIGE assay, we show Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) interacts with the prodomain and mature BDNF. The GST pull-down assays have addressed that HAP1 directly binds to the prodomain but not to mature BDNF and this binding is decreased by PolyQ Htt. HAP1 immunoprecipitation shows that less proBDNF is associated with HAP1 in the brain homogenate of Huntington&#146;s disease compared to the control. Co-transfections of HAP1 and BDNF plasmids in PC12 cells show HAP1 is colocalized with proBDNF and the prodomain, but not mature BDNF. ProBDNF was accumulated in the proximal and distal segments of crushed sciatic nerve in wild type mice but not in HAP1-/- mice. The activity-dependent release of the prodomain of BDNF is abolished in HAP1-/- mice. We conclude that HAP1 is the cargo-carrying molecule for proBDNF-containing vesicles and plays an essential role in the transport and release of BDNF in neuronal cells. 20-30% of people have a valine to methionine mutation at codon 66 (Val66Met) in the prodomain BDNF, which results in the retardation of transport and release of BDNF, but the mechanism is not known. Here, GST-pull down assays demonstrate that HAP1 binds Val66Met prodomain with less efficiency than the wild type and PolyQ Htt further reduced the binding, but the PC12 cells colocalization rate is almost the same between wt prodomain/HAP1 and Val66Met prodomain/HAP1, suggesting that the mutation in the prodomain may reduce the release by impairing the cargo-carrying efficiency of HAP1, but the mutation does not disrupt the sorting process. Recent studies have shown that proneurotrophins bind p75NTR and sortilin with high affinity, and trigger apoptosis of neurons in vitro. Here, we show that proBDNF plays a role in the death of axotomized sensory neurons. ProBDNF, p75NTR and sortilin are highly expressed in DRG neurons. The recombinant proBDNF induces the dose-dependent death of PC12 cells and the death activity is completely abolished in the presence of antibodies against the prodomain of BDNF. The exogenous proBDNF enhances the death of axotomized sensory neurons and the antibodies to the prodomain or exogenous sortilin-extracellular domain-Fc fusion molecule reduces the death of axotomized sensory neurons. We conclude that proBDNF induces the death of sensory neurons in neonatal rats and the suppression of endogenous proBDNF rescued the death of axotomized sensory neurons.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BDNF</field><field name="subject">HAP1</field><field name="subject">axonal transport</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20071204.113001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fortified Homesteads: The Architecture of Fear in Frontier South Australia and the Northern Territory, ca 1847-1885</field><field name="creator">Grguric, Nicolas Grguric</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into the use of defensive architectural techniques by
civilian settlers in frontier South Australia and the Northern Territory between 1847 and
1885. By focussing specifically on the civilian use of defensive architecture, this study
opens a new approach to the archaeological investigation and interpretation of Australian
rural buildings, an approach that identifies defensive strategies as a feature of Australian
frontier architecture.
Four sites are analysed in this study area, three of which are located in South Australia
and one in the Northern Territory. When first built, the structures investigated were not
intended, or expected, to become what they did - their construction was simply the
physical expression of the fear felt by some of the colonial settlers of Australia. Over
time, however, the stories attached to these structures have come to play a significant part
in Australia&#146;s frontier mythology.
These structures represent physical manifestations of settler fear and Aboriginal
resistance. Essentially fortified homesteads, they comprise a body of material evidence
previously overlooked and unacknowledged in Australian archaeology, yet they are
highly significant in terms of what they can tell us about frontier conflict, in relation to
the mindsets and experiences of the settlers who built them. This architecture also
constitutes material evidence of a vanguard of Australian colonisation (or invasion) being
carried out, not by the military or police, but by civilian settlers.
v
Apart from this, these structures play a part in the popular mythology of Australia&#146;s
colonial past. All of these structures have a myth associated with them, describing them
as having been built for defence against Aboriginal attack. These myths are analysed in
terms of why they came into existence, why they have survived, and what role they play
in the construction of Australia&#146;s national identity. Drawn from, and substantiated
through, the material evidence of the homesteads, these myths are one component of a
wider body of myths which serve the ideological needs of the settler society through
justifying its presence by portraying the settlers as victims of Aboriginal aggression.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">frontier conflict</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">colonialism</field><field name="subject">colonisation</field><field name="subject">south australia</field><field name="subject">northern territory</field><field name="subject">fear</field><field name="subject">fortification</field><field name="subject">settlers</field><field name="subject">weapons</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">rural buildings</field><field name="subject">buildings</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">mythology</field><field name="subject">myths</field><field name="subject">ideology</field><field name="subject">local history</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080225.161715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Solvent induced swelling behaviour of Victorian brown coals</field><field name="creator">Guy, Peter John</field><field name="description">The solvent-induced swelling behaviour of Victorian brown coals was examined in detail to probe the bonding mechanisms in very low rank coals (in this case Victorian brown coal).  Correlation of solvent properties with differences in observed swelling behaviour were interpreted in terms of the coal structure, and means of predicting the observed behaviour were considered.  Modification of the coal structure via physical compression (briquetting), chemical digestion, thermal modification, and functional group alkylation was used to further elucidate those structural features which govern the swelling behaviour of Victorian brown coals.  Briquette weathering (i.e. swelling and disintegration of briquettes when exposed to variations in humidity and temperature) was examined by making alterations to briquette feed material and observing the effects on swelling in water.
The application of solubility parameter alone to prediction of coal swelling was rejected due to the many exceptions to any proposed trend.  Brown coal swelling showed a minimum when the solvent electron-donor number (DN) minus its electron-acceptor number (AN) was closest to zero, i.e. when DN and AN were of similar magnitude.  The degree of swelling increased either side of this point, as predicted by theory.  In contrast to the solubility parameter approach (which suffers from the uncertainty caused by specific interaction between coal and solvent), the electron donor/acceptor approach is about specific interactions.  It was concluded that a combination of total and three-dimensional solubility parameters and solvent electron donor/acceptor numbers may be used to predict solvent swelling of unextracted brown coals with some success.
Solvent access to chemically densified coal was found to be insensitive to a reduction in pore volume, and chemical effects were dominant.  Thermal modification of the digested coal resulted in reduced swelling for all solvents, indicating that the structure had adopted a minimum energy configuration due to decarboxylation and replacement of hydrogen bonds with additional covalent bonds.  Swelling of oxygen-alkylated coals demonstrated that the more polar solvents are able to break relatively weak hydrogen bonded crosslinks.
The large difference between the rate and extent of swelling in water (and hence weathering) of Yallourn and Morwell briquettes was shown to be almost entirely attributable to exchanged magnesium.  Magnesium exchange significantly increases the rate and extent of swelling of Yallourn coal.  It was also shown that the swelling of briquettes due to uptake of water by magnesium-exchanged coals is reduced significantly with controlled ageing of the briquettes.
The solvent swelling behaviour of Victorian brown coals is consistent with the notion that coal is a both covalently and non-covalently crosslinked and entangled macromolecular network comprising extractable species, which are held within the network by a wide range of non-covalent, polar, electron donor/acceptor interactions.  Solvents capable of significant extraction of whole brown coals are also capable of significant swelling, but not dissolution, of the macromolecular coal network, which supports the view that the network is comprised of both covalent and ionic bonding.  Victorian brown coals have also been shown to exhibit polyelectrolytic behaviour due to a high concentration of ionisable surface functionalities.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lignite testing</field><field name="subject">lignite Victoria testing</field><field name="subject">solvent-induced swelling behaviour</field><field name="subject">Victorian brown coals</field><field name="subject">bonding mechanisms</field><field name="subject">low rank coals</field><field name="subject">briquette weathering</field><field name="subject">thermal modification</field><field name="subject">pycnometer</field><field name="subject">Morwell briquette</field><field name="subject">Yallourn briquette</field><field name="subject">Loy Yang briquette</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20031218.142251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exchanging &#65533;PayLoad&#65533; knowledge: Interpersonal knowledge exchange within consulting communities of practice</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Kevin M.</field><field name="description">Knowledge Management has evolved over time into the domain of Information Technology (IT), where codification, storage and retrieval of explicit knowledge is believed to lead to a competitive advantage for an organisation. More recently, knowledge management literature has suggested that knowledge is socially constructed and inseparable from the communities of practice in which it is held.
This dissertation examines the interpersonal process by which payload knowledge (a concept that emerged from the research data as comprising that specific distillation of knowledge, both tacit and explicit, required to resolve an applied problem in context) is exchanged in a consulting firm&#65533;s communities of practice.
Through a qualitative case study design involving sixteen in-depth interviews with consultants from a medium sized consulting firm, the nature of the interpersonal knowledge exchange process was illuminated. In this study, two inter-related research questions were addressed:
What is the interpersonal process by which knowledge is exchanged between consultants?
And,
Why do consultants prefer to participate in the interpersonal knowledge exchange process in preference to using stored explicit knowledge ?
This detailed examination of consultants as knowledge workers, resulted in the proposal of a process based model of interpersonal knowledge exchange. Utilising the concept of payload knowledge, the interpersonal knowledge exchange process is shown to be predicable in terms of passing through eight identifiable stages, yet unpredictable in terms of knowing how each community interaction will lead to payload knowledge. Within this process, the sourcing, handover, distillation and implementation of payload knowledge are seen as an artistic endeavour, characterised by social community based exchanges that &#65533;hop&#65533; the consultants toward their specific contextual need.
Key advantages of this interpersonal process are the decontextualisation and recontextualisation processes carried out at both the request negotiation stage and the knowledge handover stage. This process uses the community&#65533;s shared language, mental models, social etiquette and cultural norms to compress and funnel the meaning of the payload knowledge into a form that can be transferred meaningfully to a requesting consultant.
Through participating in the interpersonal knowledge exchange process, consultants save time, and are provided with an opportunity to confirm their personal knowledge as up-to-date and relevant to the specific context. By using the interpersonal process, consultants conform with and confirm the community&#65533;s social etiquette, which dictates its preference for the identified exchange mechanism. The interpersonal process allows them to practice and learn the consulting community&#65533;s professional artistry and, in consequence, to enjoy the exchange experience, and to have fun.
This dissertation contributes to making one aspect of the interpersonal knowledge exchange process explicit. The process, by its very nature however, appears to remain tacitly understood by those within the consulting community of practice. Through understanding the process and the reasons that consultants prefer to engage in interpersonal knowledge exchange processes, it is anticipated that managers will be better able to produce a knowledge-based sustainable competitive advantage for their firms.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organizational learning</field><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">intellectual cooperation</field><field name="subject">business enterprises</field><field name="subject">communication systems</field><field name="subject">business consultants</field><field name="subject">interpersonal knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20040310.162600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A future for human resources: A Specialised role in knowledge management</field><field name="creator">Makarand, Tare</field><field name="description">This thesis is broadly concerned with the future of the Human Resources function within organisations. The nature of these concerns is two-fold: first, how can Human Resources deal effectively with the challenges of organisational life today; second, how can Human Resources convince senior management that it is both relevant, and necessary, to the economic success of the enterprise, and so assure its future as an internal organisational function. This thesis posits that not only does an involvement in the knowledge management process hold considerable benefits for an organisation through a direct and positive influence on the &#65533;bottom-line&#65533;, but that such an involvement takes on a specialised set of aims and objectives within the human resource perspective that should not be ignored. 
The argument is that Human Resources, with its own knowledge-awareness and overview of the structures, manpower, performance and reward systems, and training and development programs, is uniquely placed to be instrumental in creating the open, unselfish culture required to make a success of Knowledge Management, and secure its own future as a trusted and valued strategic partner, fully contributing to the enhancement of organisational performance, and ultimately, the organisation&#65533;s place in the world.
The thesis commences with an overview of how Human Resources has defined its role within organisations since the 1980s. The challenges and concerns of human resources professionals are discussed, and the opportunity for them to take the lead in developing the social networks that are vital to the capture and transfer of knowledge is foreshadowed. An examination of knowledge and knowledge management concepts and principles, and a discussion of the specialised aims and objectives that a knowledge management system can be argued to have within a human resources management perspective in the 21st century is discussed next. As learning from experience with the aim of improving business performance is one of the uses of knowledge management, a discussion of &#65533;learning&#65533; and the concepts of the &#65533;learning organisation&#65533; follows.
The chapters in the first part of the thesis contain the theoretical material concerning knowledge and knowledge management, learning and the Learning Organisation, and the argument that Human Resources is in a position to play a major role in moving the organisation's culture to one of value creation and valuable strategic decision-making capability, through its awareness of the concept of knowledge and its implementation of knowledge systems, policies, and practices.
The second part of the thesis is more empirically based, and reports the results of recent research by the author into the levels of awareness of the knowledge concept, and the degree to which knowledge management systems, policies, and practices are being implemented. The purpose of the study was to test a number of hypotheses about knowledge and knowledge management and the role of the Human Resources function vis-a-vis these issues. The results and their implications are subsequently discussed.
The thesis concludes with some reflections on the concepts of knowledge and learning, and the specialised role that the Human Resources professional can play in knowledge work.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">personnel management</field><field name="subject">human resources</field><field name="subject">human capital theory</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">learning organisation</field><field name="subject">relationship to knowledge management</field><field name="subject">explicit knowledge</field><field name="subject">tacid knowledge</field><field name="subject">SECI model</field><field name="subject">socialisation; externalisation; combination; internalisation</field><field name="subject">cognitive psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20040311.093956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, Development, and Optimisation of a Culture Vessel System for Tissue Engineering Applications</field><field name="creator">Damen, Bas Stefaan</field><field name="description">A Tissue Engineering (TE) approach to heart valve replacement has the aim of producing an implant that is identical to healthy tissue in morphology, function and immune recognition.  The aim is to harvest tissue from a patient, establish cells in culture from this tissue and then use these cells to grow a new tissue in a desired shape for the implant.  The scaffold material that supports the growth of cells into a desired shape may be composed of a biodegradable polymer that degrades over time, so that the final engineered implant is composed entirely of living tissue.  The approach used at Swinburne University was to induce the desired mechanical and functional properties of tissue and is to be developed in an environment subjected to flow stresses that mimicked the haemodynamic forces that natural tissue experiences.  The full attainment of natural biomechanical and morphological properties of a TE structure has not as yet been demonstrated. 
In this thesis a review of Tissue Engineering of Heart Valves (TEHVs) is presented followed by an assessment of biocompatible materials currently used for TEHVs. The thrust of the work was the design and development of a Bioreactor (BR) system, capable of simulating the corresponding haemodynamic forces in vitro so that long-term cultivation of TEHVs and/or other structures can be mimicked. A full description of the developed BR and the verification of its functionality under various physiological conditions using Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) are given. An analysis of the fluid flow and shear stress forces in and around a heart valve scaffold is also provided.
Finally, preliminary results related to a fabricated aortic TEHV-scaffold and the developed cell culture systems are presented and discussed. Attempts to establish viable cell lines from ovine cardiac tissue are also reported.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heart valve</field><field name="subject">heart valves</field><field name="subject">tissue engineering</field><field name="subject">bioreactor</field><field name="subject">heart valve prosthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20040512.125051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescents and power: understandings of power, and deconstruction of negative peer interactions</field><field name="creator">Ricketts, Jennifer J.</field><field name="description">Contemporary researchers typically classify negative peer interactions as bullying or conflict. Theoretically, bullying involves exploiting a power imbalance to demobilize a peer(s), and conflict involves using power tactics to exert influence or resolve a dispute. This study attempted to explore the exercise of power between adolescent peers within psychological, social psychological and feminist psychological frameworks of power, and bullying and conflict constructions. Three hundred and fifty-two Melbourne students from Years 7 to 10 completed a &#65533;Young People&#65533;s School Relationships&#65533; survey. Students described their understandings of personal and interpersonal power, and rated their perceived power. The experimenter asked the students to differentiate three recent difficult incidents with peers according to perceived power disadvantage (less power), balance (same power) and advantage (more power). They described the difficulties, their responses and their perceptions of the power balance. Outcomes were rated on affect, relationship quality and overall evaluation. Power construction, gender, and year group differences on perceived personal power were examined. Scenario type (less, same, more power), gender, year group (7/8, 9/10), and relationship closeness (not friends, friends) differences on difficulties, responses and outcomes were evaluated. The power constructions formed three themes (&#65533;power-within&#65533;, &#65533;power-with&#65533;, &#65533;power-over&#65533;). Difficulties were subgrouped into three forms (two-way, one-way, other-way) and three types (physical, verbal, social). Responses were categorised into adapting, distancing, dominating and engaging. There was no support for Falbo and Peplau&#65533;s (1980) two-dimensional model for classifying types of interpersonal responses in power-differentiated situations. Power was constructed most frequently as &#65533;power-within&#65533;. Perceived power ratings formed a Global Power Score (GPS), with males reporting higher GPSs. Males and year group 7/8 reported more physical difficulties in the &#65533;same&#65533; power, and females and year group 7/8 more social difficulties in the &#65533;less&#65533; and &#65533;more&#65533; power scenarios. Students reported more adapting responses in the difficult interpersonal situations. Adapting and distancing responses were more frequent in the less power scenario, and dominating and engaging more frequent in the more and less power scenarios respectively. Affect and relationship status outcomes were rated more positively in same power scenario. Outcomes were more positive for difficulties with friends. Students rated their responses more positively when they used engaging strategies, but less positively when they used distancing or dominating. Power theories provided partial explanations for the findings and alternative frameworks to bullying and conflict for understanding negative peer interactions.

An argument is developed that school communities may be best served by a salutogenic (wellness) perspective for crisis response and recovery, which focuses on the personal and collective resources that contribute to successful coping and mental health. Three aims were addressed. First considered was the potential for commonly occuring events (e.g., the death or injury of a teacher or student, assault, vandalism or damage to school property, professional misconduct on the part of a teacher), to evoke stress, grief, or trauma responses in individuals and organisations. Emphasised was the nature of individual differences in responses to such critical incidents, and ways of dealing effectively with the varying character and intensity of such responses. The second aim was to examine the influence of pre-existing personal wellbeing and resources on individuals' responses, adjustment and growth after an incident. The third aim was to explore the interface between the individual and the organisation following critical incidents, and the nature and impact of intervention and management strategies on an individuals' sense of wellbeing and ongoing investment within the organisation. Two related studies investigated the impact of critical incidents on teachers. In Study 1, 245 teachers completed a self-report questionnaire that gathered quantitative data comprising three measures of personality and positive functioning (Psychological Wellbeing &amp; Sense of Coherence), demographic data, and teachers' previous experience of critical incidents. Teachers also provided an autobiographical account of a personally significant critical incident. Results showed that commonly occuring events, such as the death of a student or teacher, and other issues such as professional misconduct of a colleague, professional conflict, theft and vandalism were regarded as critical incidents by teachers. The four distinct response categories indentified (negative feelings, positive cognitions, negative conditions, &amp; negative impact on functioning) were characteristically grief or stress responses rather than those associated with psychological trauma. Significant relationships were identified among the personality variables and the measures of positive functioning.  Extraversion was positively related to positive functioning, and introversion negatively related. The findings point to personal and collective issues that have the potential to facilitate and enhance coping and recovery after a critical incident. In particular, six management strategies (Wellness Factors), comprising both personal and organisational components, emerged as potential contributors to ongoing psychological wellbeing, sense of coherence, and posttraumatic growth outcomes. These Wellness Factors were identified as: (a) emotional and practical support; (b) active involvement; (c) responding according to individual need; (d) access to information; (e) readiness; and (f) leadership. Study 2 involved a more detailed examination of the experience of 30 teachers following a critical incident subsequent to the completion of Study 1. This study examined personality, posttraumatic growth and personal trauma history (gathered through a self-report questionnaire), in conjunction with the pre-event personal characteristics gathered in Study 1. The second component of Study 2 consisted of a semi-structured interview that explored the teachers' personal experiences of the critical incident. Results revealed that PCI Extraversion showed significant positive relationships with Psychological Wellbeing and Sense of Coherence. PCI Emotionality showed a significant positive relationships with Posttraumatic Growth. Interview data showed that 22.5% of teachers reported a high incidence of Acute Stress responses (DSM-IV-TR criteria). In addition, anger directed at the school's leadership, and conflict between disillusionment with authority and the impact of the event. Strong negative relationships were identified among Extraversion and Openness, and the Wellness factors. Results showed that moderate stress responses are associated with Posttraumatic Growth at a personal level. However, the same responses can evoke disillusionment and cynicism at an organisational level. The findings are discussed in terms of the personal and organisational factors that contribute to healing and recovery following critical incidents. Implications for critical incident management planning, intervention and recovery are considered, along with directions for future research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high school teachers</field><field name="subject">job stress</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">school crisis management</field><field name="subject">school management and organisation</field><field name="subject">Tasmania</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050224.113610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human resource management and the small entrepreneurial start-up : a new reading</field><field name="creator">Kaye, Leah</field><field name="description">This thesis is broadly concerned with the factors that influence and shape the character of human resource management (HRM) within the entrepreneurial start-up enterprise. 
Specifically, it investigates the way in which such companies implement and action HRM activities, and evaluates the extent to which it is possible to characterise the activities as entrepreneurial and strategic.

Human resource management is understood in this thesis in its broadest sense &#65533; that is, as signifying people management within employment relationship.

Little is known, however, about the development and implementation of human resource management in small and medium size enterprises.

The majority of published research to date focuses on HRM in large, formal organisations, and is inter-organisational, rather than intra-organisational. Welsh and White comment that &#65533;Small business is not a little big business&#65533; (1981: 18), however, and it cannot be presumed that the two have the same managerial practices. Research into small business does, however, indicate that size, informality of structures and processes, and the personal preferences, values and attitudes of the owner/manager impact significantly on the way in which HR practices are adopted.

Although there is little extant research that focuses on the relationship between HR practice and strategy in small business, it has been suggested by some that they have limited ability to manage strategically due to the informality of their structures and processes. Others however speak of HRM in the small organisation as strategic where there is a discernible link with the strategic goals and objectives to improve business performance and develop organisational cultures that foster innovation and flexibility. 
The &#65533;entrepreneurial start-up enterprise&#65533; is understood in this thesis as a particular type of business; that is, a simple, small, informal enterprise with a founder/owner/manager who is opportunistic, innovative, responsive to the excitement of risk taking, and is interested in fast growth.

In the past, studies of the effectiveness of HRM and HR practices in small companies have benefited from being qualitative in nature. However, methodologies employed in the study of entrepreneurship tend to lack diversity and neglect alternative approaches (Aldrich, 1992). There has also been insufficient effort focused on researching organisation formation activities (Gartner and Starr, 1993).

This thesis employs a qualitative approach that is interpretive, naturalistic, and narrative in style, in an effort to go some way towards redressing the limitations of existing work in the twin fields of HRM and entrepreneurship research. This is a longitudinal case study of two self-styled entrepreneurial start-up enterprises: Consultco and Pilotco. Consultco is an interactive business consultancy with a recruitment practice as part of its service. Pilotco is a publishing and Internet company that was to produce a series of CD-ROM guides to key Internet sites.

A case study methodology was chosen as a sound way to explain, describe, evaluate and explore close-up HRM activities in the natural world of the entrepreneurial start-up. Narrative was chosen as a way of making the respondents stories about the organisational experiences more accessible to both the researcher and the reader, and in this way captures the unfolding story of the founding of a business as it occurs.
The thesis is presented in four parts. The first part explores entrepreneurship, the influence of the entrepreneur on their organisation&#65533;s culture, and the concept of entrepreneurial strategy within the growth process of the enterprise. It also covers different views of human resource management and the practice of HR in the context of small business, specifically the entrepreneurial start-ups.

The second part of the thesis is concerned with the theoretical methodologies that underpin the research, and the design of the study.

Part 3 presents the stories of the respondents in their own voice, to create organisational narratives for Consultco and Pilotco. A cross-case analysis follows, which tries to throw light on the process of HRM as it is practiced in the entrepreneurial start-up context. This part concludes with the researcher&#65533;s own story within the research process, and how this experience in turn influenced on the process of meaning making.
The final part of the thesis revisits the factors that influence and shape the character of HRM in the entrepreneurial context, and posits an alternative way in which to interpret the meaning of HRM, and its relationship to the opportunistic enterprise.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">new business enterprises</field><field name="subject">personnel management</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050303.140718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resolving competition for resources between multimedia and traditional Internet applications</field><field name="creator">Witosurapot, Suntorn</field><field name="description">Although the Internet is the dominant broadband network, it still has a fundamental shortcoming in traffic management that does not properly support efficient use of resources together with differentiated quality of service for mixed traffic types. Even though a number of mechanisms have been proposed under key approaches of resource adaptation, resource reservation, and resource pricing, this problem remains unsolved to date because of its complexity and the way it relates to so many considerations of engineering and economics, and the diverse range of services desired by users. Hence it is considered difficult to devise a perfect mechanism that can universally solve this problem. In this respect, this dissertation contributes to insights into potential combinations and trade-offs of key approaches above in some efficient manner for managing traffic and scarce resources in the Internet. The first part of this work considers the combination of relaxed resource reservation and resource pricing schemes for handling the unfair bandwidth distribution problem in soft-bandwidth guarantee services of the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) Internet. We show that this unfairness problem can be handled using a network-user cooperative approach that addresses both individual user satisfaction and global optimization. We propose to add a mechanism based on price-based feedback signaling to DiffServ-capable routers providing Assured Forwarding (AF) Service so that they can offer per-flow signaling. This still allows them to work at an aggregate traffic level, hence the scalability feature of the DiffServ network can be retained. Our proposed mechanism allows the network to offer reliable service assurances via a distributed optimization algorithm, without introducing special protocols or requiring routers to have access of individual user requirements. Moreover, it can provide incentives for users to cooperate so that optimum performance can be accomplished. This approach has broad applicability and is relevant to all types of assured service classes. The second part of this work considers the combination of a specific resource pricing scheme based on a distributed optimization algorithm and multimedia adaptation schemes. Such a capability has not been available because most utility functions of multimedia applications do not meet the concavity constraints required by optimization algorithm. We proposed to overcome this limitation by redefining user utility functions into equivalent discrete forms and using combinatorial (discrete) optimization so that interfacing the resource-pricing scheme can be done in a normal way. However, to obtain feasible solutions in a scalable manner, an agent is included into the scheme for solving the combinatorial (discrete) optimization on behalf of a small group of users. In return, all users belonging to this group can benefit from social welfare maximization of their utilities over a network resource constraint. The last part of this work considers the combination of relaxed resource reservation and resource pricing schemes to enable a proper charging scheme for adaptive applications in the DiffServ Internet. We provide an optimization formulation of the problems of revenue and social welfare maximization, applied at a service provider (SP) who gives access to the DiffServ Internet. In this scheme, resources are provisioned per QoS-oriented class in a long time scale (service level agreement (SLA) duration), then priced based on user demand in the short time scale. We also show that the proposed charging scheme can provide feedback and incentives for users to use the network resource optimally via the standard packet marking, hence eliminating the need for specific pricing protocol. All of the proposals in this work can be used together, solving these key problems as a coordinated whole, and all use readily available network mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telecommunication</field><field name="subject">traffic</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Internet industry</field><field name="subject">prices</field><field name="subject">computer network protocols</field><field name="subject">multimedia systems</field><field name="subject">pricing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050309.123048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narrative of women's hospital experiences the impact of powerlessness on personal identity</field><field name="creator">Polimeni, Anne-Maree</field><field name="description">Since women dominate the health care system as consumers, it is important to understand how women want to be treated by medical staff, and the factors that contribute to satisfactory hospital experiences. The present research comprised two separate but integrated studies exploring these issues. The first study adopted an
atheoretical approach. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to examine the
importance of hospital experiences in the lives of women, and the role of power within those experiences. Closed answer items about hospital experiences were completed by 124 women who had had a hospital stay of at least one night. In addition, ten of the women provided open-ended oral and written comments about their hospital
experiences, which were used as the basis of the qualitative data. The majority of the women were satisfied with their hospital stay, but a small group recalled experiences of powerlessness associated with the non-medical aspects of their treatment, such as behaviours on the part of health professionals that influenced participants&#65533; sense of control as hospital inpatients. The qualitative data reflected similar issues to the quantitative data and provided &#65533;process&#65533; information by demonstrating how health professionals&#65533; behaviour could contribute to patients&#65533; feelings of powerlessness. The results suggested that hospital experiences were a salient part of these women&#65533;s lives. The richness of the qualitative data suggested that qualitative methodology would be a productive way to further study this area.
The second study was an extension of the first via in-depth interviews with 19 women who perceived their hospital experiences as life-altering. The interview content and the analysis were based on a narrative approach that used the theoretical framework of McAdams&#65533; (1993) Life Story Model of Identity. Using McAdams&#65533; methodology enabled the researcher to evaluate how women constructed meaning from their hospital
experiences, and the main issues they faced. The life story interview also proved a useful way to explore issues of loss and self-growth in the face of traumatic hospital experiences. Transcripts of descriptions of positive and negative experiences were analysed according to McAdams&#65533; themes of agency (sense of power and control) and communion (relationships with others), and sequences of redemption and
contamination. Redemption sequences involve the storyline moving from a bad, affectively negative life scene, to a good, affectively positive life scene. In a contamination sequence, the narrator describes a change from a good, affectively
positive life scene, to a subsequently bad, affectively negative life scene (McAdams &amp; Bowman, 2001). Participants also rated their experiences according to Hermans&#65533; (Hermans &amp; Oles, 1999) list of affects. There was strong agreement between McAdams&#65533; coding of agency and
communion and Hermans&#65533; agentic and communal indices: the women&#65533;s hospital stories strongly emphasised the negative or opposite of McAdams&#65533; agentic theme &#65533;Self Mastery through Control&#65533;, which indicated powerlessness, and Hermans&#65533; affects, which involved low self-enhancement. It may be useful for future studies to conceptualise
McAdams&#65533; themes as bipolar by incorporating currently coded themes and their reverse; in particular, by expanding ideas of agency to incorporate powerlessness, as this theme was pervasive in women&#65533;s hospital experiences. The rating of affects added to the findings as this showed a latent dimension of communion manifested as isolation. The common agency and communion themes were apparent in the two distinct but related aspects of hospitalisation that affect patients&#65533; sense of control: the medical condition and the manner in which patients are treated by medical staff. The findings of the main study built on the pilot study by showing how ideas of control and powerlessness can inform better practice. For example, respectful, dignified and fair treatment by health professionals played a part in determining redemption sequences; women also indicated this was how they wanted to be treated. Due to the vulnerability of the &#65533;sick role&#65533;, disrespectful or offhand treatment by health professionals had particularly distressing effects evident in contamination sequences, such as negative changes to sense of self and attitudes toward the health care system. In some cases, such treatment led to participants&#65533; avoiding subsequent interactions with doctors and to sustained feelings of helplessness. The present thesis demonstrates that doctors, nurses
and other health professionals need to allow time to attend to the affective as well as the medical aspects of the encounter. Health professionals need a good bedside manner, compassion, and communication skills, as these characteristics play a part in maintaining female patients&#65533; sense of self and their faith in and satisfaction with the health care system.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">women's health services</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">hospital care</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050309.143640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three-dimensional bit optical data storage in a photorefractive polymer</field><field name="creator">Day, Daniel John</field><field name="description">As the computer industry grows, so will the requirements for data storage. Magnetic memory has been the most stable method in terms of capacity and recording/reading speed. However, we have reached the point where a substantial increase in the capacity cannot be produced without increasing the size of the system. When compact discs (CDs) were introduced in the 1980&#65533;s they revolutionized the concept of data storage. While the initial force behind compact discs could easily be said to be the music industry, once recordable and rewritable discs became available they quickly found more use in the computer industry as backup devices. Since their inception, the capacity requirements have far exceeded what is available on a compact disc, and they are now following the same path as magnetic memories. Following this trend, it could be assumed that digital versatile discs or digital video discs (DVDs) have a limited lifetime as a storage medium. In fact it has been noted (Higuchi et al., 1999) that the maximum capacity of digital video discs will be reached in 3 &#65533; 5 years. The question then is, what comes next? The efficiency of conventional optical data storage is extremely poor. For an optically thick recording medium, both CDs and DVDs use less than 0.01% of the total volume to store the information. Three-dimensional bit optical data storage endeavors to increase the efficiency by recording information in a volume that is greater than 90% of the total volume. The concept of three-dimensional bit optical data storage was first proposed by Parthenopoulos and Rentzepis in 1989, where they demonstrated that capacities far exceeding that of compact discs could be achieved. Three-dimensional bit optical data storage relies on creating a highly localised chemical or physical change within a recording medium, such that further layers can be recorded without causing interference. Ideally the chemical/physical change in the material should be reversible to enable erasable/rewritable data storage. In order to create a highly localised effect nonlinear excitation can be used; whereby the excitation is limited to a small region around the focal spot. Depending on the material and recording method there are several techniques for reading the information such as transmission imaging or reflection confocal microscopy. However, all the recording and reading methods require focusing to a deep position within a recording medium, such focusing encounters spherical aberration as a result of the difference in the refractive indices between the immersion and recording media. This thesis has concentrated on several areas to understand and develop the concept of three-dimensional bit optical data storage. The photorefractive effect in crystals has been studied for many years and is now widely used in optoelectronic devices. The use of photorefractive polymers is a relatively new and exciting development in optical data storage. Until now they have been used solely in the area of holographic data storage. The research in this thesis was conducted using photorefractive materials that were fabricated in two polymer matrices, poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) and poly(Methyl Methacrylate) (PMMA). The recording samples also consisted of the following compounds in various proportions, 2,5-dimethyl-4-(p-nirtophenylazo)anisole (DMNPAA), 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone (TNF) and N-ethylcarbazole (ECZ). In this project two-photon excitation was used as the recording mechanism to achieve erasable/rewritable data storage in a photorefractive polymer. As a result of two-photon excitation, the quadratic dependence of excitation on the incident intensity produces an excitation volume that is confined to the focal region in both the transverse and axial directions. Therefore, focusing the laser beam above or below its previous position provides a method by which layers of information can be recorded in the depth direction of a material, without causing interference from neighbouring layers. The feasibility of two-photon excitation in photorefractive polymers is demonstrated in this thesis. The quadratic relationship between excitation and incident light in two-photon excitation requires high photon density to ensure efficient excitation. The use of ultra-short pulsed lasers, while effective, is not a practical solution for an optical data storage system. This thesis demonstrates the ability to produce three-dimensional erasable/rewritable data storage in a photorefractive polymer using continuous wave illumination. Using this technology it has been possible to achieve a density of 88 Gbits/cm3, which corresponds to a capacity of 670 Gbytes on a compact disc sized recording medium. This is an increase of 1000 times the capacity of a CD and 130 times the capacity of current DVDs. While erasable optical data storage is an exciting prospect there are problems associated with the deterioration of the information. For long term information storage a permanent recording process would be more practical. It is demonstrated that there is a point after which further increases in the recording power result in the formation of a micro-cavity. While two-photon excitation is the recording method for erasable data storage, the increase in power results in an increase in ultra-violet absorption such that multi-photon excitation may occur. This thesis demonstrates the ability to record multi-layered arrays of micro-cavities. The change in refractive index associated with an erasable bit is less than 1%. As a result only phase sensitive reading methods (transmission imaging or differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy) can be used to image a recorded bit. Both transmission and DIC imaging systems have poor axial resolution and therefore limit the density of the recording system, as well as being large optical systems. The introduction of a split or quadrant detector reduces the size of the optical reading system and is demonstrated to be sensitive enough to detect the phase changes of a recorded bit. However, the change in refractive index across a micro-cavity is large enough that reflection confocal microscopy can be used to detect a bit. It is demonstrated in this thesis that multi-layered micro-cavity arrays can be read using reflection confocal microscopy. 

Focusing of light to deep positions within an optical thick recording medium has the effect of increasing spherical aberration resulting from the refractive index mismatching between the immersion and recording media. The work in this thesis illustrates the effect of spherical aberration on the performance of both the recording and reading systems. The work conducted in this thesis shows the ability to record multi-layered erasable/rewritable information in a photorefractive polymer using pulsed and continuous wave two-photon excitation. It has also been demonstrated that through multi-photon excitation multi-layered micro-cavity arrays can be fabricated. It has also been illustrated that while spherical aberration deteriorates the performance of the recording and reading systems it is possible to achieve a density of greater than 88 Gbits/cm3.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optical storage devices</field><field name="subject">computer storage devices</field><field name="subject">photorefractive materials</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050307.112258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">False memory in a list learning paradigm : a maturational test of a putative relationship to frontal lobe function</field><field name="creator">Koppel, Sjaanie</field><field name="description">The principal aim of this thesis was to test the conjecture of Schacter et al.

Moreover, the use of a developmental trajectory in such a manner is relatively novel, and a key issue within this thesis is how to operationalise &#65533;frontal&#65533; functioning in the sense intended by Schacter et al.  Extrapolating from Schacter&#65533;s conjecture, it was predicted that the strength of the false memory effect is directly proportional to the degree of frontal maturation, as estimated by both chronological age and by performance on a range of neuropsychological tests of &#65533;frontal&#65533; executive functioning.  False memory and executive functioning were compared in children aged 8 to 12 years and in adults using a modified DRM paradigm with a source monitoring extension after Payne et al. (1996).  The modified DRM elicited false memory effects comparable to those reported in adolescents by Newstead and Newstead (1998) and in adults by Roediger and McDermott (1995) and by Payne et al. (1996).  Three experiments that demonstrate a strong developmental trajectory for false memory effect are reported, but the pattern of results is not consistent with all of the premises of the conjecture.  Although false recognition rates increased significantly with age, source monitoring accuracy did not change across the age groups.  Consistent with the principal assertion of the conjecture by Schacter et al., age and a general &#65533;frontal&#65533; factor were found to be significantly related to the size of the false memory effect.  In addition, veridical memory performance was always a predictor of false memory performance.  The IAR (Underwood, 1965) theory can best account for the significant covariation between veridical and false memory development, as well as being able to account for the dissociation between false memory and source monitoring.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">frontal lobes</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">false memory syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050301.092349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework and coordination technologies for peer-to-peer based decentralised workflow systems</field><field name="creator">Yan, Jun</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates an innovative framework and process coordination technologies for peer-to-peer based decentralised workflow systems. The aim of this work is to address some of the unsolved problems in the contemporary workflow
research rudimentally from an architectural viewpoint. The problems addressed in this thesis, i.e., bad performance, vulnerability to failures, poor scalability, user restrictions, unsatisfactory system openness, and lack of support for incompletely specified processes, have become major obstacles for wide deployment of workflow in real-world. After an in-depth analysis of the above problems, this thesis reveals that most of these problems are mainly caused by the mismatch between application
nature, i.e., distributed, and system design, i.e., centralised management. Thus, the old-fashioned client-server paradigm which is conventionally used in most of today&#65533;s workflow systems should be replaced with a peer-to-peer based, open,collaborative and decentralised framework which can reflect workflow&#65533;s distributed
feature more naturally. Combining workflow technology and peer-to-peer computing technology,
SwinDeW which is a genuinely decentralised workflow approach is proposed in this thesis. The distinguished design of SwinDeW removes both the centralised data repository and the centralised workflow engine from the system. Hence, workflow
participants are facilitated by automated peers which are able to communicate and collaborate with one another directly to fulfil both build-time and run-time workflow functions. To achieve this goal, an innovative data storage approach, known as &#65533;know what you should know&#65533;, is proposed, which divides a process model into
individual task partitions and distributes each partition to relevant peers properly according to the capability match. Based on such a data storage approach, the novel mechanisms for decentralised process instantiation, instance execution and execution monitoring are explored. Moreover, SwinDeW is further extended to support incompletely-specified processes in the decentralised environment. New technologies for handling incompletely-specified processes at run-time are presented. The major contributions of this research are an innovative, decentralised
workflow system framework and corresponding process coordination technologies for system functionality. Issues regarding system performance, reliability, scalability,user support, system openness, and incompletely-specified process support are discussed deeply. Moreover, this thesis also contributes the SwinDeW prototype which implements and demonstrates this design and functionality for proof-of concept purposes. With these outcomes, performance bottlenecks in workflow systems are likely to be eliminated whilst increased resilience to failure, enhanced scalability, better user support and improved system openness are likely to be achieved with support for both completely- and incompletely-specified processes.
As a consequence, workflow systems will be expected to be widely deployable to real world applications to support processes, which was infeasible before.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electronic data processing</field><field name="subject">management information systems</field><field name="subject">workflow</field><field name="subject">peer to peer architecture</field><field name="subject">computer networks</field><field name="subject">distributed processing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050307.170020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public relations and contemporary theory</field><field name="creator">Mackey, Stephen</field><field name="description">In the postmodern era, as authoritative discourses are being undermined, there is an increased vulnerability of thoughts to the influence of the deliberate promotion of viewpoints. In this environment, public relations is becoming increasingly important. In this thesis I use the term &#65533;public relations&#65533; both in the sense of an extensive, specific industry, as well as in the sense of the general processes increasingly being used by all sorts of groups and organisations to get their voices heard, their effects felt, their interests defended and their aims achieved. Concomitant with this growth in public relations activity, public relations has emerged as a rapidly growing field of study within universities. This thesis critically assesses the state of this emerging university &#65533;discipline&#65533;.
A claim of this thesis is that the mainstream public relations industry is dominated by a corporatist ideology stemming from a particular US business tradition. This ideology produces a problem for university teachers, researchers and ethicists of public relations because it pervades and dominates the textbooks, teaching, research and academic-industry liaison committees. I suggest that this permeation has helped to shape the conceptual tools which public relations people use to examine their own activities. The thesis warns that this interference in academic freedom results in a situation where a genuine &#65533;professional&#65533; status for graduates with degrees in public relations is rarely achieved. I suggest than many of these graduates may not have the intellectual equipage necessary for the level of detached understanding of their field which would be necessary for them to be true &#65533;professionals&#65533;. 
This thesis attempts to explain these inadequacies. It points to the presumption of political pluralism and an unproblematic consensual society which is implicit in the approaches of the orthodox exponents of public relations since the second world war. A contrast with the candidness of public relations theory in the more elitist and authoritarian period of the 1920s and 30s helps to make this point. In order to improve public relations theory, the more recent work of &#65533;New Rhetoric&#65533; theorists is employed. These theorists point to the inevitability and in fact the necessity of the persuasive activities which construct reality in all human cultural spheres. I opposed the negative critiques of some critical theorists for whom public relations is an abomination. Instead I argue that everyone now needs to be provided with an understanding of, and access to, their own means of generating public relations-like activity. I suggest that we all need to have some sort of control over the public relations which affects us because this activity is becoming the currency used in the maintenance of all of our postmodern identities. But in grasping the nettle of participating in public relations activity, I suggest that it is also necessary to foreground the oppositional aspects of society and draw on neo-Marxist critical and cultural theories. I employ Habermas and Beck in particular in order to expose the mainstream public relations industry&#65533;s historically rooted cultural mission to maintain the pretense that we live in a consensual capitalist culture based on conservatism and corporate American values. A reformulation of public relation theory along critical theory lines is necessary in order to provide the reflexive knowledge required by teachers and students of public relations if public relations is to justify itself as a university discipline.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public relations</field><field name="subject">corporate culture</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050217.103618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'You have to be Anglo and not look like me' : identity constructions of second generation migrant-Australian women</field><field name="creator">Zevallos, Zuleyka</field><field name="description">My thesis explores the social construction of identity of 50 second generation migrant-Australian women aged 17 to 28 years using a qualitative methodology. I conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 25 women from Latin American backgrounds and 25 women from Turkish backgrounds. My study investigated the intersections of ethnicity, gender, sexuality and nationality. I found that the Latin women constructed their ethnic culture in reference to their country-of-origin traditions, and that they also identified with a pan-ethnic Latin culture that included migrants from other South and Central America countries. I found that the Turkish women constructed Turkish culture in reference to their religious practices, and they saw themselves as &#65533;Muslim-Turks&#65533; who identified with an Islamic pan-ethnic culture that included Muslim migrants from different national backgrounds. The women in both groups drew upon Anglo-Australian culture when it came to their gender and sexuality constructions. The Latin and Turkish women did not see themselves as &#65533;typical&#65533; women from their migrant communities. Instead, their sense of femininity was informed by what they saw as Australian egalitarianism. The women in both groups saw Anglo-Australians&#65533; gender relationships as an ideal, and as one woman said of Anglo-Australians, &#65533;how much more equal can you can get?&#65533; The women&#65533;s social construction of the nation was equally influenced by multiculturalism and an Anglo-Australian identity. They highly valued their Australian citizenship and felt positive about their lives in Australia. At the same time, they had faced ongoing racism and they reported that other people judged their Australian identities through racial characteristics. One woman said that in order for people to be accepted as Australian, &#65533;you have to be Anglo and not look like me&#65533;. Despite this sense of social exclusion, the majority of my sample held hybrid migrant-Australian identities. I develop a threefold typology of the women&#65533;s identities, and I found that 13 women did not see themselves as Australian, 36 women saw themselves as partly-Australian, and one woman held an exclusively Australian identity. I argue that narratives of multiculturalism and Anglo-Australian identity influenced the women&#65533;s social construction of identity. Their belief that Australian identity was multicultural was at odds with their experiences of racism and their own self identities, and so I examine the women&#65533;s beliefs in reference to an &#65533;ideology of multiculturalism&#65533;. This ideology supported the women&#65533;s contribution to the nation as second generation migrants, and ultimately, they expressed an unwavering support for Australian multiculturalism.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women immigrants</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">children of immigrants</field><field name="subject">Latin Americans</field><field name="subject">Turks</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural studies</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050323.142704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pulsar searching</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Russell T.</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the results of two pulsar survey projects conducted at the Parkes 64-m radio telescope in New South Wales, Australia.
The first, the Swinburne Intermediate Latitude Pulsar Survey, covered a large region of the southern Galaxy flanking that of the ongoing Galactic plane survey. We used the 13-feed 20 cm
'multibeam' receiver package to achieve this broad sky coverage in a short observing campaign with 14 days&#65533; total integration time. The survey proved remarkably successful, detecting 170 pulsars, 69 of which were new discoveries. Eight of the new discoveries possess small periods and period derivatives indicative of 'recycling', an hypothesis supported by the fact that six of them are in circular orbits with probable white dwarf companions. Pulse timing measurements have revealed that two of the white dwarfs are massive CO or ONeMg dwarfs. The mass of one of them (the companion to PSR J1157&#65533;5112) exceeds 1.14 M, providing the most convincing evidence to date for the production of 'ultra-massive' ONeMg white dwarfs as the end result of stellar evolution on the asymptotic giant branch (albeit with mass transfer indicated). PSR J1757&#65533;5322 also possesses a heavy white dwarf companion, in a close 11-h orbit. The proximity of the massive companion leads to significant relativistic orbital evolution and the effects of this will be measurable by pulsar timing in the coming decades. Under general relativity, the gravitational wave power radiated from the system is sufficient to cause coalescence in an event which will have dramatic and unknown consequences. Such events are possible gamma-ray burst sources, and the remnants could include isolated millisecond pulsars, close eclipsing binaries or pulsar planetary systems. The remaining four pulsar binaries show some discrepancies with the bulk of previously known low mass binary pulsars (LMBPs). PSR J1618-39 is
in a 23-d orbit, filling what previously appeared to be a gap in the orbital period distribution. PSR J1745-0952 has a relatively long pulse period (19 ms) and along with PSR J1618-39 (12 ms) may have experienced a different evolutionary history
to the majority of previously known LMBPs. A ninth pulsar discovered in the survey may also be recycled. The mean pulse profile of PSR J1411&#65533;7404 is exceedingly narrow and lies in stark contrast to that of other pulsars of similar pulse period. In the past the only other pulsars
known with anomalously narrow profiles were believed (for other reasons) to have been recycled, and this fact in combination with the low period derivative measured in timing analysis of PSR J1411&#65533;7404 leads me to suggest that it, too, may have been recycled. If this is the case, it is possible that the recycling took place in a
system similar in configuration to the progenitors of the double neutron star systems,
but that sudden mass loss or an unfavourably oriented kick in the birth event of the second neutron star disrupted the system, leaving an isolated, mildly recycled pulsar. The second pulsar survey program conducted for this work was a targeted search of southern globular clusters. We used a baseband recording system to provide unprecedented time resolution (typically 25 &#65533;s). The large number of channels and short sampling interval achievable in software filterbanks, in combination with the ability to coherently remove most of the interstellar dispersion from clusters with previously known pulsars, made us the first to achieve a relatively flat sensitivity response to pulsars of ~10&#8722;3.5&#65533;10 s. This characteristic is vital if we are to constrain the true period distribution of millisecond pulsars, an important task in the evaluation of alternative equations of state for nuclear matter. We detected six millisecond pulsars and produced pulse profiles of higher resolution than were previously available. The basic sensitivity of the search was not high enough to detect any new pulsars, however the work demonstrates that the approach is feasible with the use of currently available high-performance computing resources (such as the Swinburne workstation cluster), and is capable of delivering excellent sensitivity characteristics.
It is expected that future searches of this kind, of which this is the first, will achieve the goal of sampling the true pulse period distribution within a few years.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pulsars</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050323.141044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemo-dynamical simulations of the Milky Way</field><field name="creator">Brook, Chris Bryan A.</field><field name="description">Using a state of the art galaxy formation software package, GCD+, we model the formation and evolution of galaxies which resemble our own Galaxy, the Milky Way. The simulations include gravity, gas dynamics, radiative gas cooling, star formation and stellar evolution, tracing the production of several elements and the subsequent
pollution of the interstellar medium. The simulations are compared with observations
in order to unravel the details of the Milky Way's formation. Several unresolved issues regarding the Galaxy's evolution are specifically addressed. In our first study, limits are placed on the mass contribution of white dwarfs to the dark matter halo which envelopes the Milky Way. We obtain this result by comparing the abundances
of carbon and nitrogen produced by a white dwarf-progenitor-dominated halo with the abundances observed in the present day halo. Our results are inconsistent with a white dwarf component in the halo 5% (by mass), however mass fractions of
~1-2% cannot be ruled out. In combination with other studies, this result suggests that the dark matter in the Milky Way is probably non-baryonic. The second component of this thesis probes the dynamical signatures of the formation of the
stellar halo. By tracing the halo stars in our simulation, we identify a group of high-eccentricity stars that can be traced to now-disrupted satellites that were accreted by the host galaxy. By comparing the phase space distribution of these stars in our simulations to observed high-eccentricity stars in the solar neighbourhood, we find devidence that such a group of stars - a 'stellar stream' - exists locally in our own Galaxy. Our next set of simulations demonstrate the importance of strong energy feedback from supernova explosions to the regulation of star formation. Strong feedback
ensures that the building blocks of galaxy formation remain gas-rich at early epochs. We demonstrate that this process is necessary to reproduce the observed low mass and low metallicity of the stellar halo of the Milky Way. Our simulated galaxy is shown to have a thick disk component similar to that observed in the Milky Way through an abrupt discontinuity in the velocity dispersion-versus-age relation for solar neighbourhood stars. This final study suggests that the thick disk forms in a chaotic merging period during the Galaxy's formation. Our thick disk formation scenario is shown to be consistent with observed properties of the thick disk of the
Milky Way.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">galaxies</field><field name="subject">Milky Way</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050323.121320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the efficiency of sobriety testing to detect blood levels of cannabis and impaired driving ability</field><field name="creator">Papafotiou, Katherine</field><field name="description">Road fatalities related to marijuana intoxication have steadily increased over the last 10 years (Drummer, 1994; Drummer, 1998; Drummer &amp; Gerostamoulos, 1999). This has led to the introduction of sobriety testing in Victoria, Australia to test for driving impairment caused by marijuana and other psychotropic drugs. Surveys have reported an increase in community concern in Australia over the use of marijuana and an increase in the prevalence and use of marijuana (National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Survey; 1985, 1988, 1991, 1993; National Drug Household Survey; 1995, 1998). Commensurate with the increase in the use of marijuana in society, road statistics indicated that the number of road accidents and deaths involving the presence of THC
(the active ingredient in marijuana) in driver specimens has also increased (Drummer &amp; Gerostamoulos, 1999). Consistent with these mortality statistics, past research examining the effects of THC on driving ability indicate that THC impairs both car control (Moskowitz, 1985), and the maintenance of the lateral position of a vehicle (Ramaekers et al., 2000). Intoxication by THC is more likely to result in the crashing into obstacles on a driving course than when not intoxicated (Hansteen et al., 1976). These findings indicate that marijuana impairs driving ability and since the prevalence of marijuana use is increasing this poses a significant risk on our roads. It is essential therefore, that a tool that detects levels of THC in drivers, similar to breath analysis instruments used for the detection of alcohol in drivers, is introduced. To date, there is no such reliable instrument, that could be used on the roadside, and that accurately measures the level of THC in humans. For this reason, some government departments have considered the use of sobriety tests to detect impaired driving. In particular, the Standardised Field Sobriety test (SFSTs) that comprises the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test (HGN), Walk and Turn test (WAT) and the One Leg Stand test (OLS)
were implemented in Victoria, Australia from December 1st 2000. The validity of these tests have been previously examined by other researchers and their conclusions suggest that sobriety tests have a varied accuracy in detecting impairment caused by drugs, ranging from 44% to 94% (Heishman et al., 1996; Compton, 1986). The present study examines the efficiency of sobriety tests to detect impairment in driving caused by marijuana. The SFSTs were examined, as well as the Romberg Balance test (RB) and the Finger to Nose test (FTN) taken from the Drug Evaluation and Classification Program (DECP) (Los Angeles Police Department, USA). The present study was conducted by Swinburne University, Victoria, Australia. The National Institute on Drug Abuse in the USA (NIDA) provided the marijuana cigarettes. The major objectives of the study were to examine the influence of cannabis on driving performance and on performance on the sobriety tests. The relationship between simulated driving performance and sobriety test performance was then examined to establish the accuracy of sobriety tests to predict driving ability. The present study also examined whether any differences in performance either on the driving tests or on the sobriety tests exist between regular cannabis users and non-regular cannabis users. Driving stress was an additional variable assessed to establish whether individuals with low, normal or high driver stress perform differently on the driving task after the consumption of a low and high dose of cannabis. We tested 40 participants comprising 14 females and 26 males. All participants completed a medical examination questionnaire, demographics questionnaire, Frequency of Cannabis Use Questionnaire and Intoxication Rating Questionnaire. All participants completed 3 marijuana sessions involving the administration of a placebo cigarette (0% THC, weight 702mg, .000gm &#8710;-9-THC; 0.0mg/kg THC), the
administration of a low THC cigarette (1.74% THC, weight 779mg, .813gm &#8710;-9-THC; 0.2mg/kg THC) and the administration of a high THC marijuana cigarette (2.93% THC, weight 790mg, 1.776gm &#8710;-9-THC; 0.73mg/kg THC). All sessions were randomised
(using Latin-square design), counter-balanced and double-blind. In each session, participants completed 3 sobriety tests and 2 driving simulator tests. Sobriety tests were scored by allocating a score of 1 for each sign (error, e.g., hopping during test performance to maintain balance) observed by the administrator. Generally, a score of 2 or more constituted impairment to a degree equivalent to a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) above 0.10%. The driving simulator test comprised 36 variables.
Each time the participant performed an error, a loading factor was added to the corresponding variable (e.g., collision (variable) loading factor is 10, if a collision occurred twice a score of 20 was allocated to this variable). The sum of all 36 variables constituted the level of overall driving impairment. Blood samples were taken throughout each session approximately 20 minutes apart. Intoxication Rating Questionnaires revealed that participants reported that the subjective effect of placebo cigarettes was much weaker than the cigarettes that they usually
smoke and that no psychological (such as time distortion) and physiological (such as
increased heart rate) changes were experienced. For the low THC cigarettes most participants described the strength, and the effects, as similar to cannabis that they usually smoke. The high THC cigarette was described by most participants as being much stronger, and having some different symptoms, when compared to cannabis that they usually smoked. There were however, some differences in the description of the low THC and the high THC cannabis cigarettes between regular and non-regular cannabis users. Regular users reported that the high THC cigarette was more similar to the cannabis that they usually smoke, whereas non-regular users stated that this was more likely to be the case for the low THC cigarette. Results from the driving simulator task revealed that THC impaired the driving variables: &#65533;straddling the solid line&#65533; and &#65533;straddling the barrier line&#65533;. The results indicated that increasing levels of THC increasingly impaired the ability to maintain the
steady position of a vehicle within the correct traffic lane. The consumption of low and high doses of THC resulted in two or more wheels of the vehicle moving over a solid line marked out for traffic moving in the opposite direction. Low and high doses of THC also resulted in two or more wheels of the vehicle moving over a broken/barrier line marked out for traffic moving in the same direction. Increasing levels of THC
appear to impair both balance and attention required to control the position of a vehicle in traffic. These results are consistent with past research that indicates that THC impairs car control (Moskowitz, 1985) and increases the standard deviation of the lateral position of a vehicle (Smiley et al., 1981; Ramaekers et al., 2000). Research into the effects of THC on brain cannabinoid receptors indicate that THC interferes with normal functioning of the cerebellum, the brain region responsible for balance, posture, and the coordination of movement (Childers &amp; Breivogel, 1998). When driving ability was impaired the level of THC in the blood was between 3 and 5 ng/ml. These findings are consistent with previous research that has reported that driving is maximally
impaired by THC plasma levels of 13 ng/ml (approximately 8ng/ml in blood, using a
multiplication factor of 1.6 (Giroud, et al., 2001) (Berghaus et al., 1995). The results of the present study also indicated that THC impairs performance on sobriety tests with more individuals impaired with increasing levels of THC (e.g., at Time 1; placebo: 2.5%, low THC: 23.1%, and high THC: 46.2%). Performances on the
sobriety tests RB and FTN were unrelated to the level of THC. The test most related to the level of THC was the OLS test, where almost all signs of this test were observed, after the consumption of both low and high THC cigarettes. The accuracy of a &#65533;new&#65533; sign in the scoring procedure of the HGN test: head moves/jerks (HMJ) was also
identified. Including HMJ increased the percentage of individuals scored as impaired
after the consumption of low and high THC cigarettes (e.g., at Time 1; placebo: 2.5%,
low THC: 38.5% and high THC: 56.4%). Including HMJ as a sign significantly improved the accuracy of the SFSTs to detect impairment associated with the level of THC. The mean level of THC in the blood, when the highest number of participants
were classified as impaired, was 70 ng/ml.
Differences in performance were observed between regular cannabis users and nonregular cannabis users. Non-regular cannabis users were more impaired on the driving simulator task after the consumption of low and high levels of THC when compared to regular users. Non-regular users recorded significantly longer RTs to emergency
situations, more collisions, and shorter distances between the vehicle and an object
(after an emergency stop) when compared to regular cannabis users. Signs exhibited during sobriety test performance were related to the level of THC more often for nonregular users compared to regular users. The level of THC in the blood was higher in regular users, compared to non-regular users, at all times in both THC conditions. When driving ability was impaired and significantly related to the level of THC, the
SFSTs were also related to level of THC. Sobriety test performance was related to driving impairment, because, as driving impairment increased with the level of THC, so did the number of signs present during the performance of the sobriety tests. Since nonregular users performed more poorly on the driving task compared to regular users, it is no surprise that they exhibited a larger number of signs during the sobriety testing. Although there was a positive linear relationship between driving ability and sobriety tests, such as the relationship between straddling barrier lines and the OLS test, the validity of sobriety tests to predict driving impairment in part depends upon the size of this relationship. Using performance on the SFSTs to assess &#65533;impairment&#65533;, 46.7% of
individuals in the high THC condition were impaired. A discriminant analysis was performed to determine whether the remaining 53.3% of participants were also impaired but not classified as impaired, or whether the SFSTs correctly classified them as not impaired. The results indicated that the sobriety tests (SFSTs; HGN, WAT and OLS) correctly assessed 76.3% of participants in the high THC condition as either impaired on driving or not impaired on driving. Specifically, this percentage included the correct
identification of 84% of impaired drivers as impaired, but only 61.5% of unimpaired drivers as unimpaired. The best predictor of driving impairment was the OLS test. In the low THC condition the sobriety tests correctly classified 100% of impaired drivers as impaired, but this occurred at the expense of falsely classifying most unimpaired drivers as also impaired. This finding suggests that sobriety tests detect the presence of THC even when driving is not impaired.
Examining the utility of including the &#65533;new&#65533; sign HMJ in the SFSTs indicated that when identifying impairment on the driving task performed at Time 2, in both the low and high THC condition, the SFSTs were a better predictor of driving impairment when HMJ was included than when the sign was not included. This finding suggests that the inclusion of HMJ in SFSTs scoring procedure increases the likelihood of detecting drivers who are impaired by THC. In conclusion, the results suggest that THC impairs driving ability by reducing one&#65533;s ability to maintain a safe position in traffic. At this time THC blood levels are between 3 and 5 ng/ml. THC also impairs driving ability differently for non-regular and regular users of cannabis, where non-regular users are more impaired by THC than regular users. When this occurs, THC blood levels in non-regular users are between 2 and 12 ng/ml, and in regular users between 5 and 16 ng/ml. Performance on the sobriety tests is also impaired by increasing levels of THC. The OLS test is the most sensitive test in detecting the presence of THC. In the present study the SFST battery and each individual test that it comprises are moderate predictors of driving impairment but do misclassify 16% of impaired individuals and 38.5% of not impaired individuals. In addition, the results suggest that sobriety tests are more sensitive to the presence of THC than actual driving impairment. This was revealed by the large number of
individuals judged as impaired on driving in the low and high THC conditions even when driving was unaffected. It is important to note that when this occurred, the sobriety tests were accurate in detecting 100% of impaired individuals. Finally, the introduction of the &#65533;new&#65533; sign HMJ is likely to increase the accuracy of the SFSTs to
detect individuals impaired by THC and this sign should be considered for inclusion by policing agencies.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marijuana</field><field name="subject">roadside sobriety tests</field><field name="subject">blood</field><field name="subject">motor ability</field><field name="subject">tetrahydrocannabinol</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050323.083420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Steady-state visually evoked potential correlates of object recognition memory</field><field name="creator">Pipingas, Andrew</field><field name="description">Object recognition memory (ORM) refers to both recognition of an object and the memory of having seen it before.

This activity is thought to originate in the medial temporal lobes and the underlying right frontal cortex respectively. The aforementioned findings have been derived mainly from studies using verbal stimuli. It is uncertain whether the same neural regions are involved in object recollection. It is also uncertain whether sustained modal and transient item-related activity involve the same or different right frontal regions. In this study, steady-state probe topography (SSPT) was used to investigate both sustained and transient processes involved in the retrieval of abstract pictorial objects from memory. The ability to vary the evaluation period of the steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) allows investigation of cognitive processes occurring over different time scales. Neural regions involved in sustained modal processes were identified by examining the SSVEP values averaged over the duration of a memory retrieval task. Sustained SSVEP effects were observed over right fronto-temporal regions. Neural regions involved in transient retrieval success processes were identified by comparing the transient SSVEP responses to tasks with different memory loads. Comparison of a higher with a lower memory load condition showed SSVEP effects over parieto-temporal and right inferior frontal regions. Larger differences between memory loads gave effects that were larger and more right lateralized. Retrieval mode and retrieval success processes showed SSVEP effects over different right frontal regions. It was also found that, in contrast to the left lateralized parietal ERP response to recollected verbal stimuli, the SSVEP effects produced with abstract pictorial shapes showed a more bilateral pattern. This was considered to reflect the relatively non-verbalizable pictorial nature of the stimuli.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evoked potentials (Electrophysiology)</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050322.171342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the effects of mobile-phone type signals on calcium ion levels with a human leukaemic T cell line</field><field name="creator">Cranfield, Charles G.</field><field name="description">The work presented here outlines experiments done using a novel RF exposure chamber. This device allows biological cells to be exposed to microwave radiation similar to those emitted by mobile telephones, whilst imaging them using a laserscanning confocal microscope. Jurkat E6.1 T lymphocytes in the exposure chamber were kept within &#65533;0.5&#65533;C of 37&#65533;C, allowing for the investigation of possible athermal effects of microwave energies. These cells were loaded with the fluorescent probe Fluo-3 AM, which is specific for calcium ions, and were monitored over two 10minute periods. The first period being a control period, the second being a period where the cells were either exposed to RF energy or sham exposed. Another 5min imaging period was for the positive control,where maximal fluorescence can be achieved by the addition of the ionophore
A23187. 5 different conditions for cell exposure were investigated. Both continuous wave 900MHz and continuous wave 900MHz pulse modulated at 217Hz exposures were carried out on cells that were either unactivated, or those that were activated by the mitogen phytohaemaglutinin (PHA). For these 4 conditions the average Specific
Absorption Rate (SAR) was calculated to be 1.5W/kg. A group of unactivated cells were also exposed to continuous wave 900MHz energy with an average SAR calculation of 7.5W/kg. Results showed that no significant changes in calcium ion levels occurred when averaged fluorescence slopes were compared between RF exposed cells and the
control period. The mean change in slopes  exposed/sham period &#65533; control period)between cells that were exposed and those sham exposed also showed no significant difference. Following an inference made in the work of Galvanovskis et al. (1999)1 who showed there is a change in the calcium ion oscillation spectrum as a result of 50Hz magnetic fields, a measure of the mean frequencies of all cells was determined using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. The change in the average mean frequencies in cells was then measured for all conditions. Of statistical significance was the change in average mean frequency between the control period and the sham/exposed period between cells that were exposed and those sham exposed, when cells were activated by PHA. The results also showed that there was an overall drop in average mean
frequency as a result of RF exposure. Assuming there is a biological significance to the findings of this thesis, careful analysis of the calcium dynamics of tissue samples and cell types associated with RF exposure from mobile phones would need to be carried out to determine what they are. This was unfortunately beyond the scope of the present study.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">calcium ions</field><field name="subject">electromagnetism</field><field name="subject">radio frequency</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">radiation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050322.124601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship between leadership and information technology project success</field><field name="creator">Thite, Mohan</field><field name="description">This research explores the nature and importance of leadership in technical projects. It contends that there is a need to develop a leadership model incorporating the unique personality and occupational characteristics of technical professionals and their project environment. Increasing attention is now being paid to the non-technical aspects, such as leadership, in the execution of technical projects; but there is a dearth of empirical research justifying their importance as critical success factors.

Using Bass and Avolio&#65533;s (1990) model and its measurement instrument, this study tested the suitability of transformational leadership, considered a cornerstone of post-industrial school of leadership, in the successful execution of information systems projects. In addition, a separate technical leadership scale, derived from the meta analysis of the technical leadership literature, was also tested, compared and contrasted with Bass and Avolio&#65533;s model.

The conceptual framework postulated that a combination of transformational and technical leadership styles augment transactional leadership leading to high project success with the additional support of other contingency factors, such as clarity of project mission, top management support and availability of technical resources.
 
The population for the research was information systems projects in Australian organisations. The participating organisations were part of the top 100 computer using organisations, top 50 software companies and members of the Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA). Of the 111 organisations which were invited and found suitable, 36 participated in the research, yielding a response rate of 32%.

Each participating organisation involved two project teams in the survey, one considered more successful and another less successful, on specified parameters. The sample consisted of the IT project managers (n = 70) and their subordinates (n = 228) who described the leadership behaviours of self/manager in terms of transformational, transactional, and technical leadership scales and their perceived effectiveness. In addition, senior IT managers (n = 18) were interviewed to obtain a three dimensional (superiors, self and subordinates) perspective of project leadership.

The results were consistent with the hypothesis that managers of more successful projects exhibit transformational and technical leadership behaviours to a greater extent than managers of less successful projects. They also exhibited more of transactional contingent reward behaviour, thus, supporting the augmentation effect. Management-by-exception passive behaviour showed a strong but negative correlation with leadership outcome. As hypothesised, transformational and technical leadership scales were more strongly correlated with leadership outcome scales in more successful projects than in less successful projects. These results were in line with the previous findings on Bass and Avolio&#65533;s model. 

The more successful projects also exhibited stronger presence of the contingency factors considered in the study i.e., better clarity of project mission to team members, top management support and greater availability of technical resources. There was a broad agreement between the managers and their subordinates on leadership, outcome and contingency scales.

The factor analysis of leadership scales resulted in one transformational scale (combination of intellectual stimulation and idealised influence), one technical scale (organisational catalyst), and three transactional scales (contingent reward, management-by-exception active and passive). The modified leadership scales were used to propose a technical leadership model, laying the foundation for a technical leadership theory.  

The results demonstrate the importance of leadership as a critical success factor in technical projects and provide valuable clues on a 'role model' for aspiring project managers which include the key elements of transformational and technical leadership. While there may be no one leadership style that is effective in all project situations, the study recommends an underlying yet flexible style characterised by organisational catalyst, intellectual stimulation, behavioural charisma and contingent reward behaviours for enhanced leadership effectiveness.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">executives</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050324.162753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brain electrical activity topography in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="creator">Farrow, Maree J.</field><field name="description">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood psychiatric disorder characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattentiveness, impulsivity and hyperactivity.  Current theories of ADHD cite evidence from neuropsychological and brain imaging studies suggesting that abnormalities in the structure and function of the frontal lobes and connected brain regions are associated with impaired behavioural inhibition, constituting the primary deficit in ADHD.  While most reviewers conclude that neuropsychological studies have failed to find specific deficits in various aspects of attention in ADHD, poor performance on attentional tasks, including the continuous performance task (CPT), is a common finding and previous electrophysiological studies suggest evidence of impaired attentional processing.  This study aimed to investigate the cortical activity associated with attentional processes in children with and without ADHD, using steady-state probe topography (SSPT).  Seventeen boys diagnosed with ADHD and seventeen age matched control boys participated.  Changes in the amplitude and latency of the steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) associated with correct responses to targets in the &#65533;X&#65533; and &#65533;AX&#65533; versions of the CPT were examined.  At critical time points in both tasks, the control group demonstrated SSVEP changes suggesting increased activation and increased speed of neural processing.  These effects occurred predominantly in medial frontal, right prefrontal, right parietal and occipital regions, suggesting enhanced activity in regions previously shown to be involved in attentional processes.  The ADHD group demonstrated much smaller increases in activation and processing speed in frontal regions and predominantly reduced activation and slower processing in parieto-occipital regions.  Group differences suggesting reduced activity in the ADHD group were observed in response to the presentation of both cues and targets, as well as in the intervals leading up to target presentation, especially in the cued CPT-AX.  These results suggest that processing of task relevant stimuli as well as preparatory and motor processes may be associated with dysfunctional activation of brain networks of attention in ADHD, involving deficits in both frontal and parietal cortical regions.  These regions may also be involved in the maintenance of information required for correct task performance and the results also suggest possible deficits in these processes in ADHD.  The findings are consistent with others of reduced activation and cognitive deficits in ADHD involving these brain regions and networks, and with the idea that ADHD may be associated with a diminished ability to regulate levels of arousal and activation appropriate to task demands.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evoked potentials (electrophysiology)</field><field name="subject">Attention-deficit-disordered children</field><field name="subject">ADD</field><field name="subject">Attention-deficit disorder in children</field><field name="subject">Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050406.141958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foreign pharmaceutical firms' FDI entry strategies into China</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Fuming</field><field name="description">Foreign direct investment (FDI) in China is popular these days and this also applies to
the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. China seems to be a promising market for
pharmaceuticals with over 1.2 billion potential consumers. This huge number of people
together with the outstanding economic performance attracted multinational
pharmaceutical firms that were looking for a new market for their products. By the end
of 1998, China had established over 1,500 pharmaceutical enterprises with foreign
investment and 117 of which were invested by foreign pharmaceutical firms. Foreign
pharmaceutical firms invested their capital and technology in what is likely to be
developed as the world&#65533;s largest pharmaceutical market in the future with the
expectation they will earn an excellent return in the longer term.
When a firm decides to establish an overseas operation, it has to decide whether to
pursue the venture alone or with a joint venture partner (Bell, 1996). For most
manufacturers that want to invest abroad, the first-best entry strategy remains the sole
venture (SV), and joint venture (JV) would be a second-best invest entry strategy (Root,
1994), because JV is inferior to SV which allows investing firms to maximise the
returns on ownership-specific advantages (Caves, 1982) and to have full control over
the business operations. Foreign pharmaceutical firms who invested in China during the
period from 1980 to 1998 basically chose either a SV or JV entry mode, and over 84
percent of the foreign pharmaceutical firms chose a JV entry mode rather than a SV,
even though foreign investors have been allowed to set up 100 percent solely foreign
owned sole venture operations in China since the passage of &#65533;Law of the People&#65533;s
Republic of China on Foreign Capital Enterprises&#65533; at the Fourth Session of the Sixth
National People&#65533;s Congress on 12 April 1986. This research was designed to investigate
why the large majority of pharmaceutical firms preferred the second-best entry mode for
entering into the Chinese market.
This research has incorporated in Root (1994), Mockler and Dologite&#65533;s (1997)
conventional foreign market entry mode framework, and the relevance of Kumar and
Subramaniam&#65533;s (1997) contingency entry mode framework is acknowledged. Fieldwork was mainly conducted in China by personal interviews as well as mail questionnaire surveys over a period of three months in 1999 and 44 companies participated in total.

Using multiple indicators by means of logistic regression analysis to examine the effects
of groups of factors on entry mode decision choice between SV and JV options. Seven groups of factors (independent variables) were examined: China environmental factors, China market factors, China production factors, parent firm&#65533;s home country/region factors, parent firm&#65533;s product factors, parent firm&#65533;s resource commitment factors, and parent firm&#65533;s decision task related factors. This research has found that the probability for establishing joint ventures with Chinese partner (s) is significantly and positively related to the importance of China environmental factors and market factors. Parent firm&#65533;s decision task related factors had a positive impact on firms&#65533; decision to choose a SV entry mode. Bivariate analyses have also discovered a number of individual variables that had significant impacts on firms&#65533; entry mode choice decisions.

The research did not show sufficient evidence to support that China production factors,parent firm&#65533;s home country/region factors, parent firm&#65533;s product factors, and parent firm&#65533;s resource commitment factors had significant influences on foreign pharmaceutical firms&#65533; entry mode decisions, although the results showed expected directions of the relationships between the entry mode choice and independent
variables.

This research has contributed to the entry mode theory literature in the way of developing, as the result of the research in this thesis, an eclectic framework for better understanding of theories in choosing an entry mode between a sole venture and a joint venture in the context of foreign direct investment into the Chinese market, particularly it has discovered significant variables that affected the foreign pharmaceutical firms&#65533; FDI entry mode decisions into the Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturing industry during the period of 1980~1998. The framework can be used as a base by researchers to
develop further the theories of foreign market entry strategies and to test its relevance in
other industries or countries.

This research has also extended its examinations to some other important issues in relations to foreign direct investment in China. They are the difference between early and late entrants, and between eastern and western firms on FDI entry mode decisions, foreign pharmaceutical firms&#65533; FDI decision formulation, FDI implementation, FDI
performance evaluation, joint venture partner and operation location selections in China were also analysed and discussed in this thesis.
Further research with larger sample size into the interrelationships among strategic FDI decision formulation, entry mode choice,strategy implementation and evaluation would be worthwhile to help understand the entire process of strategic FDI planning and implementation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">joint ventures</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">pharmaceutical industry</field><field name="subject">foreign investments</field><field name="subject">international business enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050407.095122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fuzzy logic control techniques and structures for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based multimedia networks</field><field name="creator">Sekercioglu, Ahmet</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis aims to demonstrate that fuzzy logic is a useful tool for developing mechanisms for controlling traffc flow in ATM based multimedia networks to maintain quality of service (QoS) requirements and maximize resource utilization. The study first proposes a hierarchical, multilevel control
structure for ATM networks to exploit the reported strengths of fuzzy logic at various
control levels. Then, an extensive development and evaluation is presented for a subset of the proposed control architecture at the congestion control level.

An ATM based multimedia network must have quite sophisticated traffc control capabilities to effectively handle the requirements of a dynamically varying mixture of voice, video and data services while meeting the required levels of performance.

Feedback control techniques have an essential role for the effective and efficient management of the resources of ATM networks. However, development of conventional feedback control techniques relies on the availability of analytical system models. The characteristics of ATM networks and the complexity of service
requirements cause the analytical modeling to be very difficult, if not impossible.

The lack of realistic dynamic explicit models leads to substantial problems in developing
control solutions for B-ISDN networks. This limits the ability of conventional techniques to directly address the control objectives for ATM networks. In the literature, several connection admission and congestion control methods for B-ISDN networks have been reported, and these have achieved mixed success. Usually they either assume heavily simplified models, or they are too complicated to implement, mainly derived using probabilistic (steady-state) models.
Fuzzy logic controllers, on the other hand, have been applied successfully to the task of controlling systems for which analytical models are not easily obtainable.

Fuzzy logic control is a knowledge-based control strategy that can be utilized when an explicit model of a system is not available or, the model itself, if available, is highly complex and nonlinear. In this case, the problem of control system design is based on qualitative and/or empirically acquired knowledge regarding the operation of the system. Representation of qualitative or empirically acquired knowledge in a fuzzy logic controller is achieved by linguistic expressions in the form of fuzzy relational equations. By using fuzzy relational equations, classifications related to system parameters can be derived without explicit description.

The thesis presents a new predictive congestion control scheme, Fuzzy Explicit Rate Marking (FERM), which aims to avoid congestion, and by doing so minimize the cell losses, attain high server utilization, and maintain the fair use of links.

The performance of the FERM scheme is extremely competitive with that of control schemes developed using traditional methods over a considerable period of time.

The results of the study demonstrate that fuzzy logic control is a highly effective design tool for this type of problems, relative to the traditional methods. When controlled systems are highly nonlinear and complex, it keeps the human insight alive and accessible at the lower levels of the control hierarchy, and so higher levels
can be built on this understanding. 

Additionally, the FERM scheme has been extended
to adaptively tune (A-FERM) so that continuous automatic tuning of the parameters can be achieved, and thus be more adaptive to system changes leading to better utilization of network bandwidth. This achieves a level of robustness that is not exhibited by other congestion control schemes reported in the literature.

In this work, the focus is on ATM networks rather than IP based networks. For historical reasons, and due to fundamental philosophical differences in the (earlier) approach to congestion control, the research for control of TCP/IP and ATM based networks proceeded separately. However, some convergence between them has recently become evident. In the TCP/IP literature proposals have appeared on active queue management in routers, and Explicit Congestion Notication (ECN) for IP. It is reasonably expected that, the algorithms developed in this study will be applicable to IP based multimedia networks as well.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">broadband communication systems</field><field name="subject">fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">integrated services digital networks</field><field name="subject">ISDN</field><field name="subject">asynchronous transfer mode</field><field name="subject">ATM</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050411.130014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The concept of family perceptions of children who were fostered</field><field name="creator">Gardner, Isabel Helen</field><field name="description">This project investigated the subjective perceptions of family reported by people who
have experienced long-term foster care. Foster care involves removal from their
biological family of children deemed to be in need of care, and their placement in
alternative homes. Foster children may spend varying amounts of time in care, and
may have multiple caretakers. The research began with three broad questions: Who
do people who have experienced long-term foster care think of as their family? How
close do they feel to them? How would they like their family to be? Two exploratory
studies were conducted. In Study 1, 43 children in long-term family foster care (CFFC
participants) aged between 8 and 15, who had been in care for more than one year,
and 42 matched controls, completed the Kvebaek Family Sculpture Technique (KFST).
They chose figures to represent family members and placed them on a chess board,
using the squares to indicate emotional closeness or distance from each figure. A
representation of their &#65533;ideal&#65533; family was also obtained. Most CFFC participants
nominated their foster family as their family, and few changed their ideal
representation. In Study 2, 39 adults aged between 19 and 65 (AFCC participants),
who had been in either family foster care or cottage homes for at least one year, and a
comparison group of 39 matched controls, completed the KFST according to
perceptions of family now, as children, and an ideal family. An in-depth, semi
structured interview on perceptions of family followed. For the majority of AFCC
participants, connections to foster family when they were children had dissipated over
time. Nevertheless, about half of the AFCC participants were still strongly and
positively attached to one set of foster parents. The major determinant of attachment
to foster parents appeared to be a nurturing environment, while a non-nurturing
environment was the most prominent feature of failure to attach to foster parents.

Visiting by biological parents contributed to continued attachment to them, however,
relationships with biological parents were reported as ambivalent, distant, and
unsupportive. Foster care participants appeared similar to those in other studies,
however, the two samples were small, and may not be representative in terms of ideas
about family membership. Caution is necessary in any attempt to generalise from the
findings to a wider foster care population. Implications for theory, policy, and clinical
applications are discussed, and suggestions made for further research.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">foster home care</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050415.162746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tensions around introducing co-ordinated care a case study of co-ordinated care trial</field><field name="creator">Piterman, Hannah</field><field name="description">The aim of the research was to analyse the organisational dynamics surrounding a health care reform implementation process associated with the introduction of coordinated care, which is an Australian Government initiative to introduce structural changes to the funding and delivery of health-care in response to rising health care costs. A longitudinal case study of an implementation team was studied. This included the perceptions and experiences of individuals and institutions within hospitals, the general practice community and Divisions of General Practice. Furthermore, the case study explored organisational structures, decision-making processes and management systems of the Project and included an examination of the difficulties and conflicts that ensued. The broader context of health care reform was also considered. 

The study found that an effective change management strategy requires clarity around the definition of primary task in health care delivery, particularly when the task is complex and the environment uncertain. This requires a management and support structure able to accommodate the tensions that exists between providing care and managing cost, in a changing and complex system. The case study indicated that where tensions were not managed the functions of providing care and managing costs became disconnected, undermining the integrity of the task and impacting on the effective facilitation of the change process and hence, the capacity of stakeholders to embrace the model of co-ordinated care. Moreover, the micro dynamics of the project team seemed to parallel the macro dynamics of the broader system where economic and health care provision imperatives clash. Through its close analysis of change dynamics, the study provides suggestions for the improved engagement of stakeholders in health care change.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diagnosis related groups</field><field name="subject">hospital utilization</field><field name="subject">medical care</field><field name="subject">hospital patients</field><field name="subject">hospitals</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050418.092951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High energy rate of joining thermoplastic composites using microwaves</field><field name="creator">Ku, Harry</field><field name="description">One of the most important areas of the application of industrial microwave technology for materials processing is curing polymers and polymer based composites, and this is currently in a state of considerable flux.  Curing of thermosetting composites in multi-mode applicators and joining of a range of thermoplastics in ridged waveguides have been some of the major achievements in the field. This research extends the applications horizon of microwaves in the area of random fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites joining and places emphasis on the development of facilities and methodologies aiming at maximising bond quality.  It discusses the fixed frequency microwave equipment used, including a 0.8 kW variable control power generator operating at 2.45 GHz, waveguide and a tuning piston designed for obtaining a standing wave at the seam of the butted and lapped test pieces.  The effect of power input and cycle time is detailed together with the underlying principles of test piece material interactions with the electromagnetic field. The process of heterogenous joining, with filler material, or primer, of 33% by weight of random glass fibre reinforced nylon 66, polystyrene (PS) and low density polyethylene (LDPE), thermoplastic composites is mentioned together with the process of autogenous joining of 33% by weight of random carbon fibre reinforced polystyrene (PS) and low density polyethylene (LDPE). The weldability dependence on the dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and hence loss tangent of these materials is also described and investigated.  Measurements of the dielectric properties were carried out using the waveguide transmission, probe kit and resonant cavity techniques.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for surface analysis was carried out to assess if the filler material had diffused into the parent thermoplastic composite materials.  Bond strength measurements of the welded thermoplastic composites were obtained using tensile shear tests.  A variable frequency microwave (VFM) facility was also used to join the thermoplastic composites and bond strength results obtained were compared with those procured by the fixed frequency microwave configuration.  

From the measured data of LDPE/GF (33%), PS/GF (33%) and nylon 66/GF (33%), it was found that at relatively high temperatures and frequencies, these materials became less reflective and permitted more microwave energy to be absorbed.  At the same time, their dielectric loss factor increased with temperature and frequency and enabled more of the absorbed energy to be converted to heat.  Therefore, within limits, higher temperatures and higher frequencies were more suitable for microwave-assisted joining of the three materials tested.  As to the primer/filler, only liquid rapid Araldite was found to be the most favourable in microwave-assisted joining of fibre reinforced thermoplastic (FRTP) composites because of its considerably high value of loss tangent.  Another important finding was that the dielectric probe method was found to be the recommended technique to use for measurements of &#65533;&#1348;S and tan &#65533;&#65533; in microwave joining of materials out of all the methods applied.  However, for low loss materials, the values of tan &#65533;&#65533; need to be acquired through the resonance cavity method.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microwaves</field><field name="subject">thermoplastic composites</field><field name="subject">plastics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050418.140632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Filtering, clustering and dynamic layout for graph visualization</field><field name="creator">Huang, Xiaodi</field><field name="description">Graph visualization plays an increasingly important role in software engineering and
information systems. Examples include UML, E-R diagrams, database structures,
visual programming, web visualization, network protocols, molecular structures,
genome diagrams, and social structures.
Many classical algorithms for graph visualization have already been developed
over the past decades. However, these algorithms face difficulties in practice, such as
the overlapping nodes, large graph layout, and dynamic graph layout. In order to solve
these problems, this research aims to systematically address both algorithmic and
approach issues related to a novel framework that describes the process of graph
visualization applications. At the same time, all the proposed algorithms and
approaches can be applied to other situations as well.
First of all, a framework for graph visualization is described, along with a generic
approach to the graphical representation of a relational information source. As the
important parts of this framework, two main approaches, Filtering and Clustering, are
then particularly investigated to deal with large graph layouts effectively.
In order to filter 'noise' or less important nodes in a given graph, two new
methods are proposed to compute importance scores of nodes called NodeRank, and
then to control the appearances of nodes in a layout by ranking them.
Two novel algorithms for clustering graphs, KNN and SKM, are developed to
reduce visual complexity. Identifying seed nodes as initial members of clusters, both
algorithms make use of either the k-nearest neighbour search or a novel node
similarity matrix to seek groups of nodes with most affinities or similarities among
them. Such groups of relatively highly connected nodes are then replaced with
abstract nodes to form a coarse graph with reduced dimensions.
An approach called MMD to the layout of clustered graphs is provided using a
multiple-window&#65533;multiple-level display.
As for the dynamic graph layout, a new approach to removing overlapping nodes
called Force-Transfer algorithm is developed to greatly improve the classical Force-
Scan algorithm.
Demonstrating the performance of the proposed algorithms and approaches, the
framework has been implemented in a prototype called PGD. A number of
experiments as well as a case study have been carried out.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">visualization</field><field name="subject">visualization</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">graphic methods</field><field name="subject">computer graphics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050428.111554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal and interpersonal skills development in an accounting degree : a case study of accounting education</field><field name="creator">Whitefield, Despina</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the perceptions of lecturers, graduates and employers of personal and interpersonal skills development in an accounting degree at Victoria University.  The development of personal and interpersonal skills in students in higher education has been the focus of discussion amongst accounting educators, accounting practitioners and the accounting profession for many years.  There is a general consensus on what skills are necessarily sought to ensure success within the accountancy profession but very few previous studies on how those personal and interpersonal skills are being developed.

This research study presents a research framework which emphasises the complex interrelationships between an accounting curriculum, accounting lecturers, accounting graduates and employers of graduate accountants and their perceptions of how personal and interpersonal skills are developed.  A case study approach, combining archival, qualitative and quantitative methods, is used to investigate how a Bachelor of Business Accounting degree in one Australian university facilitates personal and interpersonal skills development.

The case study results indicate that the curriculum, as the vector for skills development, has both explicit and implicit references to skills outcomes.  Graduates&#65533; perceptions of many of the personal and interpersonal skills considered in this study are closely related to the curriculum findings.  However, there appears to be a lack of convergence between lecturers&#65533; perceptions, the curriculum and graduates&#65533; perceptions.  Employers generally agree that graduates display most of the personal and interpersonal skills, albeit at a low level, in the workplace.

There are curriculum implications arising from the results of this research for accounting academics who design and develop accounting programs where the value of graduates&#65533; personal and interpersonal skills are acknowledged.  As a first step, academics need to improve accounting curricula by explicitly integrating personal and interpersonal skills in their subjects.  Communicating to students the explicit nature of personal and interpersonal skills development and making them aware is the next step.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accounting</field><field name="subject">college students</field><field name="subject">accountants</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Melbourne</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">Victoria University of Technology</field><field name="subject">student attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050502.170936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The bunyip and the dragon the psychodynamics of Australian and South Korean business encounters</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Ernest Leslie</field><field name="description">This study attempts to identify and explore the psychodynamics of Australian
and Korean business encounters in Seoul, Republic of Korea, by describing and
discussing 'Australian-ness' and 'Korean-ness' as representations of what I will call
'National character in-the-mind'. A guiding hypothesis is that in highly charged
emotional settings, like those associated with foreign business encounters, National
character in-the-mind acts as a psychological and emotional container, and a protective
screen to hide more intricate institutional anxieties and defences. The data supporting
the study is drawn from my interviews with 12 Australian and 6 Korean business people
conducted between 3 and 14 June 1996 in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The study also
reflects my experience and role as researcher in the research as a source, creator and
interpreter of data through the exploration of my own introspection. The findings
demonstrate how Australian-ness and Korean-ness appear to represent projections of the
human imagination, willed within the bounds of individual experience and perception.
A model for evaluating Cultural Misunderstanding and Defensive/Adaptive Behaviour
is proposed with the aim of seeking improved understanding of the Australian and
Korean National character. The model applies learning from the research experience
which emphasises the need for Australian and Korean business people to take a more
adaptive approach to the contrary behaviours they encounter. The model also
acknowledges the value of investing time to establish and maintain cross-cultural
business relationships based on access, whereby Australian and Korean business people
see themselves as resources of mutual gain, reducing the potential for
misunderstanding, fear and mistrust and the subsequent invocation of defensive
responses.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">national characteristics</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">commerce</field><field name="subject">Korea (South)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050506.152251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotional processing in humans a neurophysiological and psychopharmacological investigation</field><field name="creator">Kemp, Andrew H.</field><field name="description">Examination of how the brain mediates emotional experience is now an area of significant and intense research interest. This is an important endeavour considering that emotion is a key component in vulnerability factors governing risk for mood and anxiety disorders. Recent neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies are also beginning to explore the effects of antidepressants on the processing of emotional
stimuli in healthy participants to help understand the role of neurochemicals in
affective behaviour more broadly. Unfortunately the literature is fraught with contradictions and complications resulting from the technique used, task instructions, selection of stimuli and gender differences. The aim of the current thesis therefore, was to investigate emotional processing in healthy participants and to examine the impact of serotonergic augmentation on this processing through the presentation of
visual emotional stimuli and examination of self report, peripheral- and neurophysiological measures of emotional responsiveness. Seventy five images low in arousal content, selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and categorised as pleasant, neutral and unpleasant, were presented to participants
in four experimental studies. Findings support previous literature suggesting that there is substantial overlap in frontal neural circuitry when the brain processes emotional images of different valence. Gender differences in the processing of visual emotional stimuli were also
observed however suggesting the need for future studies to take such factors into account. In particular, females unlike males displayed right-sided, frontal, neurophysiological activations in response to unpleasant relative to neutral images. Emotional valence was also found to modulate heart rate (HR) thereby confirming the
reliability and validity of the task-viewing paradigm. Augmentation of serotonin was found to suppress any differences in HR across the three differently valenced categories of images, while neurophysiological responses were potentiated during pleasant valence but suppressed during unpleasant valence. In summary, the studies
included in this thesis provide evidence for neurophysiological modulation by emotional content and gender. In addition, the studies employ a more systems-based approach to the study of antidepressant action, through examination of the neurophysiological responses to visual emotional stimuli. This approach may lead to greater understanding of the functional consequences of neurochemical modulation
on cortical networks involved in emotional processing.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">perceptual-motor processes</field><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">emotions</field><field name="subject">neuropsychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050608.123955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resource management in broadband multimedia networks</field><field name="creator">Jiyapanichkul, Prasit</field><field name="description">This research deals with optimal resource management in an overloaded broadband
multimedia network. Optimisation is with respect to user satisfaction, where user
satisfaction reflects both the quality of service experienced by connected users and the
dissatisfaction of users blocked from access to the network.

The research focuses on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks and the Internet, because these are the dominant emerging broadband networks which present some fundamental unsolved problems, related to the sharing of resources between mixed traffic types. ATM networks use conservative admission control, which protects
network resources and ensures a high level of service for those admitted to the network, but results in low network efficiency because of low utilisation of resources due to blocking of many potential users. The Internet does not use admission control, with the result that performance degrades progressively as load increases. This causes frustration among users, and lowers the network efficiency due to high levels of congestion.

We propose an optimisation model for each network (ATM networks and the Internet)which is intended to represent the distribution and consumption of key network resources by different traffic types. The model is aimed at maximising performance such that users admitted to the network are offered no less than some minimum acceptable level of quality of service (QoS). The solution is a set of traffic flow rates on each path which results in maximising an objective function value (revenue based on network operator interest or throughput based on customer interest) for a given network
configuration with given user demand. As an example using the ATM network model, we illustrate the application of the model to an ATM network carrying both connection oriented and connectionless traffic. We explore the optimal response to a link failure which in turn causes node overload. As an example using the Internet model, we consider an overloaded network with link bottlenecks and an overloaded Web server, and explore the effect of transferring some server capacity to a mirror site and a proxy server.

For real-time traffic control, the optimisation model is used to assign quotas for bandwidth or connections to selected paths. A control algorithm is implemented to provide maximum performance by admitting requests within the quotas which are obtained from the optimisation model. In an ATM network simulation, the algorithm is used to manage the virtual path (VP) pool in a network which suffers a link failure. A comparison is made between fixed virtual path management (FVPM) and dynamic
virtual path management (DVPM), comparing the revenue achieved by each. This illustrates how DVPM adapts the VP pool in a robust fashion to achieve maximum revenue in the face of a link failure. However, the transient response suggests that benefit could be obtained using non-steady-state solutions. The model is extended by taking network state and traffic parameters into account to control changes in the VP pool to recognise limits to the rate at which traffic can be moved (through the natural
birth-death processes). This scheme is called state dependent virtual path management (SDVPM). Performance evaluation of the new model shows that SDVPM achieves higher revenue than DVPM when the network suffers a link failure that requires a major change to the VP pool. In an Internet simulation, two algorithms are compared for control of access to a proxy server and a set of primary servers. An algorithm based on
optimal flow solutions provides substantially better network performance than a localised heuristic algorithm. In each simulation case (ATM and Internet examples), the performance using a control system based on the steady state optimum flow model is close to the ideal optimal result.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multimedia systems</field><field name="subject">broadband communication systems</field><field name="subject">computer networks</field><field name="subject">asynchronous transfer mode</field><field name="subject">ATM</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050610.100950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethoxylation reactor modelling and design</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Yen-ni</field><field name="description">The manufacture of nonionic surfactants generally involves ethoxylation via ethylene oxide condensation onto a hydrophobe substrate, mostly in the presence of an alkaline catalyst. Nonionic surfactants are used widely in industrial applications, such as detergents, health and personal care, coatings, and polymers. In Australia, approximately one-third of the annual consumption of nonionic surfactants is imported from offshore manufacturers; the market is highly competitive with the local manufacturer facing increasing
competition from imports. Optimisation is a pressing need for the current manufacturing plant of the industrial partner for this research project, Huntsman Corporation Australia Pty Limited, the sole domestic manufacturer of nonionic surfactants in Australia. Therefore, the objectives of this research project were
to gain a better understanding of the various chemical and physical processes occurring
simultaneously in an ethoxylation process; to identify the process limitation in an existing production plant operated by Huntsman Corporation Australia, and to explore measures for enhancing the asset productivity of the production plant. An ethoxylation process working model, describing the chemical kinetics and the physical transport processes involved, was developed to aid the exploration of optimisation opportunities, which would
otherwise be empirical. Accordingly, this research project was structured into a two-stage program. The first stage determined the ethoxylation kinetics experimentally. The second stage investigated the interactions of physical transport processes numerically using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. The manufacturing scheme discussed in this thesis gave particular emphasis to the
ethoxylation process operated in semi-batch stirred reactors.  In the first stage, a series of kinetic experiments was performed in a well-stirred laboratory autoclave under base-catalysed conditions. The experimental outcomes were developed into a comprehensive kinetic model which took into account the non-ideal features in the reactor operation. Time-dependent
physical changes of the reaction system, such as liquid volume, ethylene oxide solubility and density were also included. The ethoxylation behaviour predicted by the model was shown to be in good agreement with the experimental measurements. This indicated that the kinetic model was sufficiently robust to reproduce the reaction behaviour of a commercially operated ethoxylation operation. In the second stage, numerical simulations of an existing ethoxylation reactor system were presented.
In addition, two components were addressed: identification of the process limitation and increasing productivity of the industrial-scale ethoxylation plant. An important assumption was made for the ethylene oxide injection system used in this research project which subsequently simplified the ethoxylation system into a single liquid with miscible chemical species. In the identification of the process limitation, three possible rate-limiting factors were examined:
mixing, heat removal and reactor pressure rating. Examination and analysis of the physical data available from plant batch reports found that the reactor pressure rating and the presence of nitrogen padding were the rate-limiting factors to the ethoxylation operations in the industrial reactors. It was recommended that the reactor pressure rating be increased to raise the asset productivity of the reactor.
In the numerical simulations of the ethoxylation reactor, time-dependent CFD models were developed for two systems: the ethylene oxide injection pipe and the stirred ethoxylation reactors. The heat transfer of ethylene oxide liquid injection was calculated in a two-dimensional model of the dip-leg pipe used in an industrial-scale ethoxylation reactor. The computation gave the temperature of the
injection outflow which was validated against the calculated value by empirical correlation. The effects of various surrounding reaction temperatures, injection rates and pipe sizes on the heat transfer rate were investigated. From these, a range of operating conditions yielding a liquid ethylene oxide outflow was selected. Furthermore, it was found that boiling of ethylene oxide was significantly reduced with increasing pipe diameters. It was recommended that the asset productivity of the reactor be improved by keeping more ethylene oxide injected as a liquid in the reaction mixture to raise the reaction rate and shorten the reaction time.
Three-dimensional simulations of a baffled reactor agitated by a single- or a dual-Rushton impeller were presented for both non-reactive and reactive flows. Multiple frames of reference and sliding grid methods were used in sequence to describe the relative motion between the rotating impeller and the stationary baffles. The turbulence parameters were modelled with the standard k- &#65533; turbulence model. The simulations of non-reactive flow were compared with the literature velocity data obtained from both the experiments and simulations. Good agreement was achieved. The model was then extended to
incorporate ethoxylation flow with integration of the kinetics established in the first stage. Both the laboratory autoclave and the industrial-scale reactors were simulated. The former took into account the ethoxylation exotherm and the latter was carried out isothermally. Both simulations were validated against reaction data obtained from physical experiments, either the kinetic experiments or the plant batch
productions. The validated model allowed us to determine the optimum operating condition and explore a new reactor system with enhanced asset productivity. A 50% increase in productivity could be accomplished if the ethoxylation was operated closer to the current design pressure limit. Furthermore, the operating pressure of a new reactor system needed to be doubled if the asset productivity were to be increased to approximately three times the current performance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface active agents</field><field name="subject">chemical kinetics</field><field name="subject">chemical reactors</field><field name="subject">Huntsman Corporation Australia Pty.

The outcomes of this review suggests that schizophrenia brain electrophysiology, demonstrate some differences, but with a variability reflective of the symptom heterogeneity. The literature associated with the use of attentional tasks while recording EPs, tended to demonstrate some consistency. The methodological issues associated with the EEG and EP recordings may also account for this variability. An evoked potential technique, which has been demonstrated to be sensitive to the changes in cognitive processes associated with attention, is the Steady State Probe Topography (SSPT) technique. The SSPT is a combination of both the Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) and the Probe-ERP paradigm. This technique allows the SSVEP to be measured continuously, is relatively insensitive to artifact, and can display the topographic distribution of the SSVEP measures during the attentional task. The technique employs the use of a sixty-four channel EEG recording system. This consists of a multichannel electrode helmet; multichannel amplifier/filter, task presentation computer and a computer controlled data acquisition system. Software was also developed to analyse the recorded brain electrical activity to produce the SSVEP magnitude and phase versus time series for each electrode site. The topographic distribution of the SSVEP measures associated with specific events during attentional tasks could also be displayed. At the time of the pilot study, this technique had not been applied previously to the study of schizophrenia and therefore warranted further study. Two separate studies are reported; an investigative pilot study and a chronic group study. The pilot SSVEP and schizophrenia study was designed to examine the changes in the SSVEP and its topography, during the performance of a number of attentional or activation tasks to examine the possibility of hypofrontality. The tasks selected for the study were those previously used for the examination of hypofrontality with metabolic imaging techniques; the Continuous Performance Task (CPT) and the Wisconsin Card Sort (WCS). The SSVEP was elicited by a superimposed 13Hz flicker on the visual field, while subjects performed computerised versions of the neuropsychological tasks. Topographical maps of the SSVEP magnitude distribution were then interpolated and displayed as an animated sequence synchronised with particular events occurring during the tasks. In comparison to the male control group, male schizophrenic patients exhibited differences in the SSVEP topography for all tasks, possibly reflecting the deficits in behavioural indices. Overall, the findings indicated that the technique demonstrated some merit for further examination of frontal SSVEP topography in schizophrenia. In a larger study of twenty chronic schizophrenia patients, the frontal topographical distribution of the SSVEP was examined. The earlier pilot study finding of reduced frontal SSVEP amplitude was replicated. The issue of hypofrontality in schizophrenia was applied as a possible interpretation.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evoked potentials</field><field name="subject">electrophysiology</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">pathophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050610.152013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer simulation of nanorheology for inhomogeneous fluids</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Junfang</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) methods to investigate the structural and dynamic properties of highly confined atomic and polymeric fluids undergoing planar Poiseuille flow. We derive 'method of planes' expressions for pressure tensor and heat flux vector for confined inhomogeneous atomic fluids under the influence of three-body forces. Our derivation is validated against NEMD simulations of a confined atomic fluid acted upon
by a two-body Barker-Fisher-Watts force coupled with the Axilrod-Teller three-body force. Our method of planes calculations are in excellent agreement with the equivalent mesoscopic route of integrating the momentum and energy continuity equations directly from the simulation data. Our calculations reveal that three-body forces have an important consequence for the isotropic pressure, but have negligible in&#65533;uence on the shear stress and heat flux vector for a confined simple fluid. We use the non-local linear hydrodynamic constitutive model, proposed by Evans and Morriss [1] for computing a viscosity kernel, a function of compact support, for inhomogeneous nonequilibrium fluids. Our results show that the viscosity kernel, &#65533;(y),
has a peak at y = 0, and gets smaller and decays to zero as y increases. Physically, it
means that the strain rate at the location where we want to know the stress contributes
most to the stress, and the contribution of the strain rate becomes less significant as the
relative distance y increases. We demonstrate that there is a limitation in the model
when it is applied to our confined fluids due to the effect of domain restriction on inverse
convolution.  We study the nanorheology of simple polymeric fluids. Our NEMD simulation results show that sufficiently far from the walls, the radius of gyration for molecules under shear in the middle of the channel follows the power law, Rg / N&#65533;, where N is the number of
bonds and the exponent has a value &#65533; = 0:60&#65533;0:04, which is larger than the melt value
of 0:5 for a homogeneous equilibrium &#65533;uid. Under the conditions simulated, we find that
viscous forces dominate the flow, resulting in the onset of plug-like flow velocity pro&#65533;les
with some wall slippage. An examination of the streaming angular velocity displays a strong correlation with the radius of gyration, being maximum in those regions where Rg is minimum and vice-versa. The angular velocity is shown to be proportional to half the strain rate su&#65533;ciently far from the walls, consistent with the behaviour for homogeneous fluids in the linear regime. Finally, we make some concluding remarks and suggestions for future work in the

Both reconciliation and the treaty-making process in British Columbia are understood as attempts to build such relationships. Yetthese are policies that have arisen in response to the persistence of indigenous claims for recognition of rights and respect for identity. Consequently, I consider what the purpose of new relationships might be: is the creation of new relationships to be the means by which settlers recognise and respect indigenous rights and identities, or is
there some other goal? To answer this, I analyse the two policies as the opening of negotiations over indigenous claims for recognition. That is, the opening of new political spaces in which indigenous people&#65533;s voices and claims may be heard. Reconciliation opened a space to rethink Australian attitudes to history and culture, to renegotiate Australian identity. Treaties in British Columbia primarily seek to renegotiate ownership and control of lands and resources. Both policies attempt to relegitimise the polities in which they operate, by making new relationships that provide for mutual recognition.  However, the thesis establishes that these new spaces are not nearly as expansive or inclusive as they are made out to be. They are in fact defined by the internal struggles of settler society to make life more certain: to resume identities that are secure and satisfying, and to restore territorial control and economic security. This takes place with little regard for the legitimate claims of indigenous peoples to be recognised as people and to enjoy dynamic, flourishing identities of their own. Building new relationships becomes the path to entrenching old certainties.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">government relations</field><field name="subject">Indians of North America</field><field name="subject">British Columbia</field><field name="subject">treaties</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050627.092937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prolegomena to reflective film study : a Bourdieusian analysis of the economy of cinematic exchange</field><field name="creator">Lupton, David</field><field name="description">What is unique to the experience of cinema that has ensured its ongoing popularity across generations of filmgoers? As both a theoretical construct and a real world practice, cinematic experience is necessarily implicated in systems of social and cultural stratification, and thus subject to the drive for symbolic distinction amongst classes. As such, practical logics grounded in specific cultural arbitraries hinder illumination of the complexities of film going, perpetuating epistemological errors based in social ignorance and therefore denying a new understanding of cinematic experience in its embodied state. By uncovering the key theoretical and methodological fallacies informing scholastic knowledge production within the discipline of film studies, the sociological program of Pierre Bourdieu allows for the systematic mapping of cinematic experience as an economy of exchange &#65533; an economy engaging specialised categories of patron recognition and appreciation in order to offer an experience of recognised social value. Whilst subject to a range of both theoretical and methodological criticisms, ultimately the deficiencies of Bourdieu&#65533;s program are outweighed by the benefits of reflexive sociology in developing the autonomy of the field of film studies, allowing for future film study fully cognizant of the mechanisms of symbolic violence and thus academic knowledge production more attentive to the destructive logic of the open market.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motion pictures</field><field name="subject">motion picture audiences</field><field name="subject">Pierre Bourdieu</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050708.092149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced vibration analysis techniques for fault detection and diagnosis in geared transmission systems</field><field name="creator">Forrester, B. David</field><field name="description">The primary objective of the research reported in this thesis was the improvement of safety in helicopters by identifying and, where necessary, developing vibration analysis techniques for the detection and diagnosis of safety critical faults in helicopter transmission systems. A review and, where necessary, expansion of past research is made into (a) the mechanisms involved in the production of vibrations in mechanical systems, (b) the failure modes experienced in geared transmission systems, (c) which failure modes are critical to the safety of helicopters, (d) how the safety critical failure modes affect the vibration signature, and
e) the vibration analysis techniques currently used to detect safety critical failures. The effectiveness of the currently available vibration analysis techniques is investigated
using in-flight vibration data from Royal Australian Navy helicopters and seeded fault
data from a purpose built spur gear test rig.
Detailed analysis of techniques for synchronous signal averaging of gear vibration data is
undertaken, which includes the development of new methods of modelling and quantifying the effects of synchronous averaging on non-synchronous vibration. A study of digital resampling techniques is also made, including the development of two new methods which provide greater accuracy and/or efficiency (in  computation) over previous methods. A new approach to fault diagnosis is proposed based on time-frequency signal analysis techniques. It is shown that these methods can provide significant improvement in diagnostic capabilities over existing vibration analysis techniques. Some limitations of general time-frequency analysis techniques are identified and a new technique is developed which overcomes these limitations. It is shown that the new technique provides a significant improvement in the concentration of energy about the instantaneous frequency of the individual components in the vibration signal, which allows the tracking of small short term amplitude and frequency modulations with a high
degree of accuracy. The new technique has the capability of 'zooming' in on features which may span only a small frequency range, providing an enhanced visual representation of the underlying structure of the signal.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">helicopters</field><field name="subject">fault location (engineering)</field><field name="subject">reliability (engineering)</field><field name="subject">gearing</field><field name="subject">vibration</field><field name="subject">safety</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050715.092623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity and career</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Paul S.</field><field name="description">The issue is making sense of identity and career as mutually contouring.

That framework constitutes an advance upon thinking about identity and career in Modernist terms, in that each of the constituent theories goes beyond the duality of subjectivity and objectivity to reconceptualise the subject as entangled, inscribed, and involved. Given that conception, we begin to see why the achievement of a coherent identity through career is inherently problematic. To reach that way of seeing, I analyse the narrative accounts of two research partners: accounts of their lives and careers. The goal of the analysis is to demonstrate the illuminative potential of the combined theory that is developed in the first part of the thesis: a potential which is partly realized in the ways that the analysis reveals a mutual contouring that had not been fully recognised by the research partners.

The project was motivated by the observation that a clear disparity existed between the teaching of entrepreneurship &#65533; in which attention to EBP has been intense and significant &#65533; and entrepreneurship research &#65533; in which attention to EBP has been negligible. Discovery commenced with development of an analytical framework suitable for classifying and analysing an EBP paradigm, should one be found to exist. This framework was created by combining the four essential ingredients of a paradigm &#65533; distilled from an analysis of several definitions of the word paradigm in appropriate contexts &#65533; with the three core roles which Mintzberg (1994) argued are the key descriptors of the function of any plan. An existing but inadequate EBP paradigm was revealed by a content analysis, conducted according to an adapted combination of the methodological prescriptions of Krippendorf (1980) and Carney (1972), of a large sample of the existing EBP normative literature: that is, prescriptions purporting to teach the reader how to write a successful Entrepreneurial Business Plan. A combination of logical critique, application of appropriate analytical models and development of grounded theory &#65533; based upon the methodology first articulated by Glaser and Strauss (1967) &#65533; resulted in production of an enhanced EBP paradigm, a complex construct embracing: (1) precise definition of application boundaries, (2) twelve laws; (3) six success rules; (4) and specified instrumentation requirements. Application of the enhanced EBP paradigm involved four research case studies embracing the case research methodology espoused by Yin (1989). Four Entrepreneurial Business Plans were written according to the prescriptions of the enhanced EBP paradigm and submitted to the marketplace. Sufficient time (between four and eight years) was allowed for results to be monitored. The four case study businesses were selected to span a variety of key attributes designed to maximise two things: (1) the ability to attribute causation of observed results (most particularly the attraction of the investment funds solicited by each Entrepreneurial Business Plan) directly the application of the enhanced EBP paradigm rather than any other possible cause; (2) the ability to make wide rather than narrow inferences about the applicability and utility of the enhanced EBP paradigm. Inferential conclusions were drawn from individual and cross-case analysis. Four points encapsulate the most significant results of the research to the community of entrepreneurship scholars and practitioners and beyond them, to the managerial community at large. (1) The research provides a basis for systematic inquiry in the field of Entrepreneurial Business Planning and a template for quality assessment of Entrepreneurial Business Plans. (2)It redresses the imbalance between research and teaching in an important field of the entrepreneurship discipline. (3)It extends the domain, credibility and utility of entrepreneurship as a discipline. (4) It is the potential generator of many practical analytical constructs and corollary theory in a wide variety of managerial fields. Extended case analysis provided two examples of domain extension and the generation of corollary theory and practice: first, in the field of &#65533;venture renaissance&#65533; (a term coined to represent the domain of all non startup applications of the enhanced paradigm of Entrepreneurial Business Planning) and second, in the field of mergers and acquisitions. These two illustrations of corollary theory and practice provide strong concluding arguments in favour of the proposition that the enhanced EBP paradigm has substantial general utility. In summary, as a result of the research reported in this dissertation, Entrepreneurial Business Planning may be regarded as a distinct grouping of integrated techniques amounting to a managerial technology for removing impediments to business growth by attracting necessary investments on behalf of articulated strategies. Entrepreneurial Business Planning has thus emerged from vague definition amid the narrow contextual confines of a startup venture seeking venture capital, to precise definition in a far broader context as a generic technology for the removal of impediments to business growth, wherever and however they occur.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">new business enterprises</field><field name="subject">new products</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050802.152712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular simulation of dendrimers under shear</field><field name="creator">Bos&#65533;ko, Jaroslaw Tomasz</field><field name="description">In this work flow properties of dendrimers are studied with the aid of molecular simulations.

The objective of this research is to analyse the influence of the molecular topology in the macroscopic flow behaviour of the melts.  Systems of dendrimers of generations 1 to 4 undergoing planar shear are compared to the melts composed of linear chain polymers.  The internal structure and shape of dendrimers is extensively analysed.  The response of the molecules to the shearing in the form of stretching and alignment is studied.  The correlation between the onset of shear thinning and the onset of deformation of molecules is observed.  The changes in the fractal dimensionality of dendrimers due to shearing are also analysed.  Dendrimers, due to their highly branched structure and compact globular conformations in the melt, are found to behave differently when sheared, compared to traditional linear polymers.  Unlike linear polymers, they do not undergo transition form the Rouse to the reptation regimes.  This effect is explained in terms of the suppressed entanglement between molecules. Moreover, dendrimers when compared to linear chain systems exhibit lower Newtonian viscosity, onset of the shear thinning at higher strain rates, and less pronounced shear thinning in the non-Newtonian regime.  They can be used as rheology modifiers, as it is shown in the preliminary results obtained from the simulations of the dendrimers-linear polymer blends. In agreement with other theoretical and experimental studies, dendrimers in the melt are found to have compact space-filling structure with terminal groups distributed throughout the interior of the molecule.  Suggestions for the further study of dendrimers via molecular simulations are made.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dendrimers</field><field name="subject">molecular dynamics</field><field name="subject">rheology</field><field name="subject">MD</field><field name="subject">NEMD</field><field name="subject">SSLOD</field><field name="subject">fluids</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050804.141034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of disk-based baseband recorders and software correlators for radio astronomy</field><field name="creator">West, Craig James</field><field name="description">This thesis details work undertaken in the field of radio astronomy instrumentation. Specific components of the data collection and processing systems used by radio astronomers have been implemented using non-traditional approaches. Traditionally, the correlation of radio astronomy data has taken place on dedicated,
specific hardware. This thesis deals with the implementation of equivalent correlators
using software running on generic clusters of personal computers - the software approach to radio astronomy. Toward this end a system has been developed that records the raw telescope output onto computer hard drives, allowing
easy access to the data on cluster supercomputers.  Part of this thesis describes the design, construction, testing and utilisation of these data recording systems. The correlator software used to process these data
on supercomputers is also fully described, including extensive tests of the software
and a detailed comparison between its output and the output of an existing hardware correlator. The software correlator is shown to produce output that agrees extremely well with the hardware correlator, verifying its accuracy and performance.  Finally, results of on-going scientific investigations that use the software correlators described in this thesis are outlined, illustrating the flexibility and usefulness of the software approach to radio astronomy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">astronomy</field><field name="subject">VLBI</field><field name="subject">Very long baseline interferometry</field><field name="subject">radio sources (astronomy)</field><field name="subject">radio astronomy</field><field name="subject">instruments</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050804.143155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and enhancements of adaptive random testing</field><field name="creator">Merkel, Robert Graham</field><field name="description">Random testing is a standard software testing method. It is a popular method for reli-ability assessment, but its use for debug testing has been opposed by some authorities. Random testing does not use any information to guide test case selection, and so, it is argued, testing is less likely to be effective than other methods.

Based on the observation that failures often cluster in contiguous regions, Adaptive Random Testing (ART) is a more effective random testing method. While retaining random selection of test cases, selection is guided by the idea that tests should be widely spread throughout the input domain. A simple way to implement this concept, FSCS-ART, involves randomly generating a number of candidates, and choosing the candidate most widely spread from any already-executed test. This method has already shown to
be up to 50% more effective than random testing. This thesis examines a number of theoretical and practical issues related to ART.

Firstly, an theoretical examination of the scope of adaptive methods to improve testing
effectiveness is conducted. Our results show that the maximum improvement in failure detection effectiveness possible is only 50% - so ART performs close to this limit on many occasions. Secondly, the statistical validity of the previous empirical results is examined. A mathematical analysis of the sampling distribution of the various failure-detection effectiveness methods shows that the measure preferred in previous studies has a slightly unusual distribution known as the geometric distribution, and that that it and other measures are likely to show high variance, requiring very large sample sizes for accurate comparisons.

A potential limitation of current ART methods is the relatively high selection overhead. A number of methods to obtain lower overheads are proposed and evaluated, involving a less-strict randomness or wide-spreading criterion. Two methods use dynamic, as-needed partitioning to divide the input domain, spreading test cases throughout the partitions as required. Another involves using a class of numeric sequences called quasi-random sequences. Finally, a more efficient implementation of the existing FSCS-ART method is proposed using the mathematical structure known as the Voronoi diagram.

Finally, the use of ART on programs whose input is non-numeric is examined. While existing techniques can be used to generate random non-numeric candidates, a criterion for 'wide spread' is required to perform ART effectively. It is proposed to use the notion of category-partition as such a criterion.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer software</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="subject">software engineering</field><field name="subject">random testing</field><field name="subject">software development</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050804.144747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical evolution of galactic systems</field><field name="creator">Fenner, Yeshe</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the chemical signatures of galaxy formation and evolution using a software package designed specifically for this investigation. We describe the development of this multi-zone chemical evolution code, which simulates the spacetime evolution of stars, gas and a vast array of chemical elements within galactic systems. We use this tool to analyse observations of a wide range of astrophysical
systems.

The chemical evolution code is first calibrated using empirical constraints from the Milky Way. These simulations help shed light on the nature of the gas accretion processes that fueled the formation of our Galaxy. We demonstrate the importance of low- and intermediate-mass stars in explaining the elemental and isotopic abundance patterns measured in Galactic stars. An intriguing question in astrophysics is whether pollution from intermediate-mass stellar winds is responsible for anomalous abundances in globular cluster stars. We test this scenario by modelling the formation and chemical evolution of a globular cluster.

Recently, the most detailed abundance pattern ever measured beyond the local universe was obtained for a high-redshift quasar absorption cloud, providing an exciting opportunity to explore early conditions of galaxy formation. We compare the chemical abundances in this distant object with predictions from a series of models, in order to gain insight into the protogalaxy's age and star formation history. We continue investigating the high-redshift universe, turning our attention to the issue of space-time variations in the fine-structure constant, as suggested by quasar absorption-line constraints. An excess abundance of heavy Mg isotopes in
the absorbing clouds could partly account for the data, without needing to invoke variations in fundamental constants of nature. An enhanced early population of intermediate-mass stars could lead to such extreme Mg isotopic ratios, but we show that additional chemical consequences of this scenario conflict with observations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">astronomy</field><field name="subject">astrophysics</field><field name="subject">galaxies</field><field name="subject">nucleosynthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050804.161449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Workplace identity</field><field name="creator">Agostino, Joseph</field><field name="description">There have been a limited number of studies carried out on employee workplace identity. There have been many studies carried out on organizational change; however, they have been carried out mostly from an instrumentalist perspective where the topic of organizational change has been treated in isolation from other aspects of organization. The question of how a relationship exists between employee workplace identity and organizational change has been left unanswered. This thesis applies narrative theory as a conceptual bridge across identity and change. By considering how employees derive a sense of workplace identity from the workplace narratives, and organizational change as the destruction of existing workplace narratives and adoption of new workplace narratives, it is possible to gain new understandings of these concepts. A theory is developed which explains how narrative theory creates a relationship between identity and change. This new theory is further developed to explain how narrative theory creates a relationship between organizational identity, culture, leadership, conflict, and change. The new extended theory is applied to a narrative presentation of empirical data, which offers a powerful explanatory lens for understanding the relationship between these chosen aspects of organization.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organizational change</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Melbourne</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">self-perception</field><field name="subject">group identity</field><field name="subject">organizational behaviour</field><field name="subject">Tratcom Works (Firm)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050805.134042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The efficacy of early childhood memories as indicators of current maladaptive schemas and psychological health</field><field name="creator">Theiler, Stephen Samuel</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates theoretical propositions of Beck (1996), Epstein (1987), and Young (1999) that suggest maladaptive schemas operating as deep unconscious cognitions are intrinsically linked to the psychological health and wellbeing of the individual. To date, research on psychological health has mainly used self-report measures that focus on conscious processes. The primary aim of this thesis was to explore particular maladaptive schemas that purportedly operate unconsciously and to examine their relationship with self-reported psychological dysfunction. Bruhn&#65533;s (1990a) Cognitive Perceptual Theory of early childhood memories was employed as a vehicle to access schemas deemed outside of conscious awareness. These unconscious schemas were investigated in conjunction with current self-reported maladaptive schemas in Study 1 and psychological symptoms in Study 2.
The participants in Study 1 comprised 249 undergraduate first year psychology students. There were 198 women and 50 men with a mean age of 22 years who were asked to write down four early childhood memories. The first two memories were spontaneous in order to reveal the most pressing underlying schemas. The next two early memories requested were relating to mother and to father, to gain schema information about relationship dynamics. The participants then filled out the short-form of Young&#65533;s (1998) Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-S). Independent raters coded the memories for Young&#65533;s (1994) Early Maladaptive Schemas, and Last and Bruhn&#65533;s (1992) Object Relations categories of &#65533;Perceptions of Others&#65533;, &#65533;Perceptions of the Self&#65533;, &#65533;Perception of Environment&#65533;, and &#65533;Degree of Interpersonal Contact&#65533;, and &#65533;Individual Distinctiveness&#65533;. Polyserial correlations indicated that there were significant relationships between maladaptive schemas represented in early memories and self-reported maladaptive schemas. However, the lack of maladaptive schemas in memories being linked to the same maladaptive schemas that were being self-reported, suggested that the schemas represented in memories were tapping into a different source of information than conscious self-reports. A Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) was performed with the sample divided into three groups (low, medium and high YSQ-S scorers). The results showed that maladaptive schemas identified in early memories that corresponded to Young&#65533;s (1990) &#65533;Disconnection and Rejection&#65533; domain and, Last and Bruhn&#65533;s (1992) Object Relations theme of &#65533;Perceiving the Environment as Unsafe&#65533;, were significant predictors of people in the group with high levels of self-reported maladaptive schemas. These variables also differentiated people in the high group from those in the low group at a greater rate than chance (33 percent). Fifty&#65533;six percent of people were correctly allocated to the high group on the basis of representations of these particular schemas in their memories. When only the low and high groups were analysed, using individual schemas rather than domains, &#65533;Mistrust/Abuse&#65533;, &#65533;Social Isolation&#65533;, &#65533;Emotional Deprivation&#65533; and &#65533;Subjugation&#65533; schemas in the first analysis and &#65533;Perceptions of the Environment as Unsafe&#65533; in the second analysis were found to be significant predictors. These predictors correctly classified 70 percent of cross-validated cases in the high groups in both analyses.
For Study 2, the participants comprised 278 undergraduate first year psychology students. There were 65 men and 206 women with a mean age of 22 years who provided accounts of four early childhood memories as in Study 1. They also completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Derogatis, 1993). As with Study 1, the accounts of the completed early childhood memories were coded by independent raters who examined the memories for Young&#65533;s (1994) Maladaptive Schemas and Last and Bruhn&#65533;s (1992) Object Relations categories. Additionally, following each memory, the participants rated their memories using Hermans and Hermans-Jansen&#65533;s (1995) list of Affect Terms.
The sample was divided into three groups on the basis of the General Severity Index [GSI] scores (low, medium and high scorers) that were derived from the BSI (Derogatis, 1993). A Discriminant Function Analysis showed that maladaptive schemas identified in the memories that corresponded to Young&#65533;s (1990) &#65533;Disconnection and Rejection&#65533; domain were significant predictors of people in the group with high levels of self-reported psychological symptoms (Derogatis, 1993). Fifty percent of people (which is greater than the chance rate of 33 percent) were correctly predicted as belonging to the high group on the basis of representations of schemas from this domain.
In another DFA analysis that used individual schemas instead of domains, &#65533;Abandonment&#65533; and &#65533;Insufficient Self-Control&#65533;, together with &#65533;Perceiving the Environment to be safe&#65533; and &#65533;Negative Affect&#65533;, were found to be significant predictors that correctly allocated 58 percent of people into the high GSI group. Further analysis using only the low and high groups resulted in 83 percent of people in the high group being correctly identified on the basis of representations of &#65533;Abandonment&#65533;, &#65533;Insufficient Self-Control&#65533; and &#65533;Perceiving the Environment to be safe&#65533;. These results endorse the relevance of the relationships among an underlying sense of abandonment and insufficient self-control with high levels of psychological symptoms of distress.
Taken together, the findings from both studies support the theoretical proposition that schemas residing outside of conscious awareness can have a pervasive link with psychological health and wellbeing. A particularly important discovery was that a relatively small number of schemas centered around perceptions of &#65533;Disconnection and Rejection&#65533; from others, that were operating unconsciously, were significantly linked to people in both studies who reported a wide range of psychological difficulties. It was concluded that investigating object relations, affect, and Young&#65533;s (1990) maladaptive schemas in early memories, is an efficient and possibly essential method of gaining information that may otherwise not be obtained from self-report measures exclusively. Consequently, in therapy, maladaptive schemas associated with disconnection and rejection represented in clients&#65533; early childhood memories can be viewed as very important unconscious schemas to examine. This is especially necessary given that these schemas may not be consciously accessed or easily articulated by clients, and yet seem to be intrinsically linked to a range of conscious psychological difficulties.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">early memories</field><field name="subject">recollection (psychology)</field><field name="subject">cognitive psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050805.162326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processing and recognition of document and GIS images</field><field name="creator">Yu, Donggang</field><field name="description">In intelligent document processing system and geographical information systems (GIS), the image processing and recognition play an important role.  This thesis deals with various problems in processing images in documents and GIS: image smoothing, filling, linearization and extraction of contour features, extraction of structural points, separation and recognition of spurious segments in handwritten digits, reconstruction and recognition of broken digits, and separation and recognition of colour document and GIS images.  These approaches are also called Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

A new smoothing technique is developed to smooth follow contours of image.  With the new smoothing algorithms, spurious pixels (points) of contours are removed based on smooth patterns, and smooth followed contours are found.  Also, skeletons of image can be smoothed between neighboring &#65533;end&#65533; and &#65533;junction&#65533; points.  Smooth following makes linearization of smoothed contours possible based on Freeman codes.  

A new filling algorithm of contours, project filling, is described based on two kinds of structural patterns.  By this method, any complicated contours of images can be filled correctly.

Different from other linearization methods, linearization and feature extraction of smoothed contours are based on difference chain codes. Curvature and bend angles of linearized are found.  The convexity and concavity of linearized are described.  In this way, a series of description features of contours is formed.  

Structural points are new and useful features to describe morphological structures between neighboring linearized lines.  Extraction of structural points is based on structural patterns which are determined by element chain codes.  Also, extension Freeman codes are used in this thesis.  Structural points make description and recognition of contours possible.

In order to recognize handwritten digits in document processing systems, separation of spurious segments, reconstruction of broken digits and recognition of handwritten digits are investigated.  Experiments with large number of testing data set show satisfactory results for these algorithms.

Separation and recognition of colour document and GIS images are discussed.  Object images of document and GIS images are extracted based on the description of shape structures, prior knowledge and color information, which are associated with each other.  Color images can be described by a limited number of colors in color document and GIS images.  Therefore, separation of color image is done by color reduction method, and recognition of object images is based on structure patterns, prior knowledge and colour information.  It can be seen that specific information should be considered in many practical problems to achieve better processing results.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image processing</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">optical data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050812.095914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unmaking the other? : discourses in intellectual disability in contemporary society</field><field name="creator">Quibell, Ruth Grace</field><field name="description">Unmaking the Other? is a qualitative sociological analysis of the discourses of intellectual
disability present in contemporary Australian society. It attempts to reveal the ways that people with intellectual disabilities 'are' for Australians. This is important because people with
intellectual disabilities have a long history of being seen as 'other' or 'not one of us'. For many
years they were kept 'out of sight, and out of mind&#65533; on the margins of our communities, locked
in institutions or hidden in sheltered workshops. Yet, during the last few decades there has been
a concerted effort to bring people with intellectual disabilities back into society. Institutions and sheltered workshops closed, and policies of inclusion, normalisation and community living were vigorously pursued. People with intellectual disabilities are now equal citizens in the eyes of the law.

But how readily have we accepted that people with intellectual disability are 'one of us'? Have
community living reforms overturned deep cultural dispositions that cast people with intellectual disabilities as 'lesser', 'defective', and lacking personhood? This thesis investigates recent community living reforms, especially the assumption that inclusion and education would
radically transform our conceptualisations of people with intellectual disabilities. To do this, it draws on contemporary social and political theory to explore how the meanings of disability are created and maintained, focusing on the Foucauldian concept of discourse. This Foucauldian
theorisation of discourse, power and knowledge informs a methodology devised to provide a
more detailed and sophisticated analysis of the meanings of intellectual disability than previous
investigations. Texts from three key social arenas are analysed for the way in which our society
constructs intellectual disability, and these analyses lead to a number of theoretical and practical conclusions.

Specifically, the main contributions of this thesis are: the identification and analysis of fourteen distinct discourses of intellectual disability, the theoretical explication of their relations to one another, and theoretical discussion of what their presence reveals about intellectual disability in today&#65533;s Australia. The findings of a variety of discursive constructions of intellectual disability suggest a complex picture in which discourses of inclusion and membership have emerged that are consistent with community living reforms, while at the same time there has been a continuation of discourses that view people with intellectual disabilities as defective humans.

Drawing on theory and empirical evidence, possibilities are suggested for further political and educational interventions into the discursive construction of people with intellectual disabilities.

The problems posed by our attempts at liberation through community living reforms are major;
this thesis contributes to this task by revealing the complexity, contradictions, and resistances
inherent in this task. What is more, it sees these findings not as causes for dismay, but as reasons for cautious hope.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">disability theory</field><field name="subject">qualitative methods</field><field name="subject">people with mental disabilities</field><field name="subject">sociology of disability</field><field name="subject">social ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050830.133554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Confessing their faith' : an enquiry into the meaning which Anglicans confirmed as adults give to their confirmation and the place which confirmation has in their faith journey</field><field name="creator">Savage, Ian David</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to discover what meaning adult candidates for Anglican confirmation gave to their confirmation, how they experienced the ritual and what place confirmation had in their continuing faith journey. The research report retells the stories of eight adults. The stories of four are presented as case studies. The baptism/ confirmation stories of all research participants are presented as metaphors, a form of 'systematic thematic analysis' (Plummer 1983). For the study I adopted a life history, case study approach (Jones 1983; Plummer 1983; Minichiello et al. 1995) drawing on the insights of ritual theory (Turner 1969, 1972, 1976) and the concept of transitional phenomena proposed by Winnicott (1965, 1971). 

Two sets of contextual factors formed the background to the study: the Church's tradition and its debates about confirmation and the attitudes of lay people about their faith and about the Church. The research method involved a grounded theory approach. The principal data creation techniques were in-depth interview and the Faith Autobiography pro forma. Following the initial interviews, each research participant was sent a summary of the research findings (Summary of themes). The Summary gave the metaphors which emerged from the interviews, together with brief notes on the concepts used to interpret the data. Responses from the research participants were incorporated into the final form of the metaphors: Belonging to myself, Returning/ Starting over, Growing up, Joining the family and Making a commitment. 

Most research participants did not regard baptism/confirmation as joining the Church: rather they saw themselves as belonging to the Church already; neither were they concerned with becoming Anglicans. For the majority, the transition they made in baptism/confirmation paralleled another life transition which was taking place or was expected to take place. Taking part in the research helped form the participants&#65533; ideas about baptism/confirmation. While the catechumenal process is able to provide a holding environment in which candidates for baptism/confirmation can explore the transitions in which they are involved, the initiation liturgy should reflect the &#65533;return&#65533; motif which emphasises incorporation as well as the traditional Exodus motif which emphasises separation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church of England</field><field name="subject">confirmation</field><field name="subject">Anglican Communion</field><field name="subject">liturgy</field><field name="subject">organisational behaviour</field><field name="subject">rituals</field><field name="subject">Anglican Church</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050830.150519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of multi-particle flows in bubbling gas-solid fluidised beds</field><field name="creator">Bell, Robyn Anne</field><field name="description">In Victoria, Australia, brown coal is utilised as a major source of energy for the power generation industry. Victorian and South Australian brown coals have a very high moisture content and therefore, the efficiencies of power generation in traditional pulverised fuel fired furnaces are low. Fluidised beds offer a number of advantages over conventional furnaces, leading to improvements in efficiency and environmental impact. A disadvantage with implementing fluidised bed technology is the issue of scale-up. Fluidised bed behaviour can alter significantly with changes in scale, because of their strong dependence on the bed hydrodynamics. Hence, there is a need to accurately model bed behaviour to ensure that the effect of changes in scale are well understood and will not become costly and time consuming.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques can be applied to fluidised bed systems to gain a better understanding of the hydrodynamic behaviour involved. In the past, numerical models have considered only single particle sizes due to the added complexity of interaction between particles of differing sizes and densities. Industrial fluidised beds typically contain more than one particle size and density, therefore there is a need to develop a numerical model which takes this into account. The aim of this thesis is to develop and validate CFD techniques for modelling the behavior of a gas-solid fluidised bed containing more than one particle size and density.

To provide validation data for the numerical model, physical experiments are undertaken on a small two-dimensional bubbling gas-solid fluidised bed. Mixing and segregation behaviour of different materials are investigated. The experiments demonstrate that whilst only a small proportion of the bed consists of different size/density particles, significant changes in bed behaviour are apparent. Changes in bubble rise velocity, bubble size and bubble shape are observed.

A number of constitutive equations must be included in the numerical model, including relationships for the momentum transfer between various phases and solids pressure. Different combinations of these constitutive equations are investigated. A new equation for particle-particle interactions is derived and included in a CFD model. The CFD model is validated against both data in the literature and physical experiments. From the validation studies, an optimum equation set is identified. This optimum equation set produces numerical results that closely resemble experimental bed behaviour, thus bringing the goal of solving scale-up problems one step closer. The use of this type of CFD model will ultimately result in timely and cost effective solutions for both the power generation and chemical processing industries.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coal</field><field name="subject">combustion</field><field name="subject">fluidized-bed combustion</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">numerical analysis</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050902.132803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the auditory brainstem response characteristics of people with Parkinson's disease</field><field name="creator">Yousefi, Shahriar</field><field name="description">This dissertation is the documentation for a Doctoral research program undertaken at the Industrial Research Institute of the Swinburne University of Technology (IRIS), in collaboration with the School of Biophysical Sciences and Electrical Engineering (BSEE), between the years of 2000 and 2004.  The objective of the research work that was undertaken was to study the auditory brainstem response (ABR) characteristics of people with Parkinson&#65533;s Disease (PD) to determine whether or not these characteristics could form the basis of a tool for determining the presence of PD; the performance of medication, and disease progression.

Prior to the commencement of this research, the gold-standard for PD diagnostics was considered to be autopsy, and the only tools available for assessment of living patients were fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) / fluoroDopa (FDopa)-based positron emission tomography (PET) or conventional (subjective) clinical testing.  The use of PET was costly and impractical for monitoring disease progression.  Clinical testing approaches, on the other hand, had a degree of subjectivity, leading to potential misdiagnoses with inadequately trained clinicians.  It was therefore postulated that a low-cost technique based on conventional ABR testing equipment, which was readily available within the medical environment, could provide considerable benefits.  

In order to be useful as a tool, ABR would ultimately need to identify uniquely the presence of PD from other potential disorders, most notably multiple system atrophy (MSA) which was sometimes confused with PD.  At the time this research was conducted, the prevailing method of differentiating PD from MSA was based upon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  This research was only concerned with the first stage of such a research process &#65533; that is, determining whether the ABR of PD patients was fundamentally different to that of a control group.

In undertaking the investigation, a significant component of the research involved drawing together research literature from a large number of sources in order to present a case that could present a reasonable research path for experimentation.  The next stage of the research involved developing an experimentation program that could be used to compare the ABR characteristics of people with PD against a control group and, further, to compare the ABR characteristics of PD participants against their level of impairment, as measured on a conventional mobility test.

In summary, the outcomes of the experimental process that was undertaken, and the statistical analysis of the outcomes, suggested that: (1)
People with mild manifestations of PD, who were in an unmedicated state, had marked abnormalities in the amplitude of Wave III of their ABR waveform.

(2) The amplitude of Wave III of the ABR waveform was sensitive to variations in PD medication levels.

(3) The amplitude of Wave V of the ABR waveform was, to a lesser extent than Wave III, affected by the presence of PD and medication levels.

(4) The latencies of Waves III and V of the ABR waveforms did not appear to be affected by the presence of PD or by variations in medication levels.

This highlighted a need to provide an intelligent, user-friendly system of tool selection and recommendation that can also provide predictive economic performance data for engineers and end-users alike.  Such an 'expert system' was developed for a local manufacturer of cutting tools in the form of a relational database to be accessed over the Internet.

A number of performance predictive models were reviewed for various machining processes, however they did not encompass the wide range of variables encountered in metal machining, thus adaptation of these existing models for an expert system was reasoned to be economically prohibitive at this time.  Interrogation of published expert systems from cutting tool manufacturers, showed the knowledge-engineered principle to be a common approach to transferring economic and technological information to an end-user.  The key advantage being the flexibility to allow further improvements as new knowledge is gained.  As such, a relational database was built upon the knowledge-engineered principle, based on skilled craft oriented knowledge to establish an expert system for selection and performance assessment of cutting tools.

An investigation into tapping of austenitic stainless steels was undertaken to develop part of a larger expert system. The expert system was then interrogated in this specific area in order to challenge by experiment, the skilled craft oriented knowledge in this area.  The experimental results were incorporated into the database where appropriate, providing a user-friendly working expert system for intelligent cutting tool selection, recommendation and performance data.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metal-cutting tools</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">expert systems (computer science)</field><field name="subject">industrial applications</field><field name="subject">computer integrated manufacturing systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050914.085324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autobiographical memory and social anxiety the impact of self-focus priming on recall</field><field name="creator">Dickson, Janet Mary</field><field name="description">Self-focused information processing has become a central aspect of cognitive explanations of social anxiety disorder. Indeed, Clark and Wells (1995) theorized that the key feature of the disorder is the processing of the self as a social object. It is proposed that when socially anxious individuals enter feared situations, they shift their attention to a detailed monitoring of themselves. Such self-focused attention triggers recollections of negative experiences from the past and directs attention towards signs of threat. This interferes with the processing of the situation and leads to misinterpretation of others' behaviours. Although there is now considerable support for the Clark and Wells' model from research on imagery, post-event and anticipatory processing, there is surprisingly little evidence for memory disturbance. Unlike mood disorders, to date, deficits in accessing autobiographical memories have not been found for social anxiety.    
In this thesis it is argued that a possible reason for the lack of evidence of memory deficits in social anxiety is that researchers have not attempted to manipulate participants' levels of self-focus in conducting research on autobiographical memory. The focus of this thesis was on the accessibility and quality of the autobiographical memories of socially anxious and non-socially anxious individuals obtained under conditions of self-focus in comparison to responses obtained when not self-focused. 
The present research utilized a two-phase quasi-experimental design with a sample of 144 adults taken from an initial pool of 203 volunteers. The final sample comprised 30 men and 114 women, ranging in age from 17 to 67 years (M = 26, SD = 11.91, median age = 20 years). The sample consisted of 292 undergraduates and community participants recruited via advertisements. Group membership was based on selection criteria from a measure of social anxiety, the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI; Turner, Beidel, Dancu &amp; Stanley, 1989b), depression and general anxiety from the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995), and the anxiety disorder interview schedule (ADIS-IV-L; Di Nardo, Brown &amp; Barlow, 1994). Initial respondents were allocated to socially anxious (SA), socially anxious depressed (SAD), and non-socially anxious (NSA) groups, with the SAD group forming a further control group of respondents with high scores in SPAI social anxiety and DASS depression. 
Approximately half of each group was primed to Self-focus, by making an impromptu speech which was videotaped and replayed to each participant individually, following an adaptation of a priming methodology by Perowne and Mansell (2002). The other half of the participants was not self-focused. Rather, they viewed video tape of a confederate giving a speech so as to Other-focus. The priming was prior to participants' provision of written responses to positive and negative (social anxiety) cue words using Williams' (2002) Autobiographical Memory Test. The quality of the memories was measured according to overgenerality for positive and negative cues. Reaction time was recorded for memories to the same valenced cues. The incidence of anxiety and depression content in the memories was determined using coding schemes devised by Gottschalk and Gleser (1969).
As hypothesised, the results confirmed that greater levels of generality and longer reaction time to positive cues (not for negative cues) were evident when comparing self-focused SA with self-focused non-socially anxious (NSA) individuals, reflecting findings for other emotional disorders such as depression. Self-focused socially anxious (SA) individuals responded with greater levels of generality and longer reaction times for memories for valenced cues, particularly positive ones, than other-focused SA individuals. Further analysis for generality found that self-focused SA respondents were more general than other-focused socially anxious with comorbid depression (SAD) individuals for memories for positive cues. However, both groups were similar for negative memory cues. As confirmation for memory deficits as a function of the priming manipulation, greater generality and longer reaction times for memories for positive cues occurred when comparing self-focused SA individuals, to all control groups (NSA groups and other-focused SAD individuals). Without priming, SA individuals did not demonstrate autobiographical memory deficits in quality or accessibility compared to NSA controls. 
Exploration of the autobiographical memory content indicated that SA (compared to SAD and NSA) individuals, irrespective of focus, reported more depression than anxiety content in their memories. Additionally, self-focused SA in contrast to other-focused SA individuals, experienced heightened depression content in their memories, although none of the individual categories of depression was prominent. Predictions of SPAI social anxiety and DASS depression scores from the significant predictors associated with the memories, were undertaken separately for self- and other-focused individuals. Reaction time to positive cues was found to be the only stable predictor of both social anxiety and depression for the self-focused respondents. For the other-focused condition, only total anxiety content theme was found to predict social anxiety, albeit poorly. 
Overall, the present thesis established that the self-focusing manipulation unearthed a memory processing deficit in socially anxious individuals, similar to that found in most emotional disorders in terms of quality, accessibility, and content, of the memories. This result was particularly apparent in relation to responses to positive cues. The findings are consistent with the Clark and Wells' (1995) model of the disorder emphasising the role of the views of the self as the core element of the disorder. The results also show that the processing deficits of social anxious individuals are confined to the self-focus condition. It is suggested that more attention should be placed on the self-role in social anxiety and that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, efficacious in mood disorders by reducing the overgenerality effects, is also relevant to social anxiety disorder. 
Future longitudinal research should be conducted with clinical groups of socially anxious patients, using a self-focus manipulation, to ascertain if the results of the present can be replicated and extended. Pre- and post-treatment measurements of the autobiographical memories of socially anxious patients should be measured and compared, to ascertain whether the deficits can be repaired through the use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; Williams, Teasdale, Segal &amp; Soulsby, 2000). Self-focus priming could also be used with other anxiety disordered individuals such as generalised anxiety disorder and panic individuals, as they too, appear to be likely candidates for the ruminative self-focus which has contributed to the memory processing deficits established in the autobiographical memories in social anxiety disorder.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social anxiety</field><field name="subject">autobiographical memory</field><field name="subject">self-focus</field><field name="subject">cognitive theory</field><field name="subject">counselling</field><field name="subject">depression (mental)</field><field name="subject">self-conciousness</field><field name="subject">anxiety</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050915.135524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensing and control of Nd:YAG laser cladding process</field><field name="creator">Salehi, Dariush</field><field name="description">Surface engineering provides solutions to wear and corrosion degradation of engineering components. Laser cladding is a surfacing process used to produce wear and corrosion resistant surfaces by covering a particular part of the substrate with another material that has superior properties, producing a fusion bond between the two materials with minimal dilution of the clad layer by the substrate. The advantages of laser cladding compared to conventional techniques include low and controllable heat input into the workpiece, a high cooling rate, great processing flexibility, low distortion due to the low heat input to the workpiece and minimal post-treatment. The main processing parameters of laser cladding include laser power, laser spot size, processing speed, and powder feed rate. Within an optimized operational window, all these variables have some effect on the temperature of the clad interaction zone. The laser cladding technique is very complicated because it involves metallurgical and physical phenomena, such as laser beam-materials interaction, heat transfer between the clad and the substrate, and the interdiffusion of the clad and the substrate materials. Laser cladding is currently an open-loop process, relying on the skills of the operator and requiring dedication to specialty to make it successful. Unless the required expertise is provided, attempts to make the process successful will be futile. The objective in conducting the project was to investigate and develop prototype sensors to monitor and control Nd:YAG laser cladding process. Through a LabVIEW software based monitoring program, real-time process monitoring of optical emissions in the form of light and heat radiation was carried out, and correlated with the properties of the produced clad layers. During various experiments, single- and multiple-track laser cladding trials were performed. The responses of such sensors to the selected conditions were examined and an in depth analysis of detected heat and optical radiation signals was carried out. The results of these experiments showed the ability of such sensors to recognize changes in process parameters, and detected defects on layer surfaces along with the presence of oxides. A multi-function closed-loop laser power and CNC motion table feed rate control interface based on a LabVIEW platform has been designed and built, which is capable of accepting and interpreting sensors&#65533; data and adjusting accordingly the laser power and CNC motion table feed rate to produce sound clad layers. The developed dual control strategy utilized in this study forms a relatively inexpensive and less-complicated system that allows end-users to achieve lower failure rates during laser cladding (within its own limitations) and, therefore, through successful concurrent control of melt pool temperature and motion table feed rate provide better productivity and quality in the experimentally produced clad layers.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metal cladding</field><field name="subject">laser beams</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050915.142812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of cultural change and acculturation on the health and help seeking behaviour of Vietnamese-Australians</field><field name="creator">Ohtsuka, Thai</field><field name="description">This study investigated the influence of cultural change and acculturation on
health-related help seeking behaviour of Vietnamese-Australians. Using convenience
sampling, 94 Vietnamese-Australians, 106 Anglo-Australians, and 49 Vietnamese in Vietnam participated in the study. Beliefs about health and health-related help-seeking behaviours were assessed through measures of common mental health symptoms, illness expression (somatisation, psychologisation), symptom causal attributions (environmental, psychological, biological), and choice of help seeking (self-help, family/friends, spiritual, mental health, Western medicine, Eastern medicine).Vietnamese-Australian data was compared with that of the Anglo-Australian and Vietnamese-in Vietnam. Results revealed that the help seeking behaviours and health related cognitions of Vietnamese-Australians, while significantly different from those of Anglo-Australians, were similar to those of Vietnamese in Vietnam. Specifically, both Vietnamese groups were less likely than Anglo-Australians to somatise and
psychologise or attribute the cause of symptoms to environmental, psychological or biological causes. However, the two Vietnamese groups were not different from each other in their style of illness expression or in their symptom causal attributions. The Vietnamese-Australians  reported experiencing more mental health symptoms than the Vietnamese in Vietnam but fewer than the Anglo-Australians. In relation to help seeking, the Anglo-Australians chose self-help more than the Vietnamese, but there were few other differences between the cultural groups.

To investigate the influence of acculturation on health-related beliefs and help seeking behaviour, Vietnamese-Australians were compared according to their modes of acculturation (integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalisation). Generally, results showed a distinct pattern of response. Those with high levels of acculturation towards the Australian culture (the integration and the assimilation) were found to be most similar (in that they scored the highest in most areas measured) to the Anglo-Australians, while few differences were found between the separated and the
marginalised groups. Further, cultural orientation was a powerful predictor of help
seeking. In that, original cultural orientation predicted selection of help seeking from
Western and Eastern medicine, whereas, the host cultural orientation was a more robust predictor of the other variables. However, neither cultural orientation predicted preference for mental health help. Finally, the study found that, although the combination of symptom score, modes of illness expression, and symptom causal
attribution were strong predictors of choice of help seeking of Vietnamese-Australians,
acculturation scores further improved predictive power. The results were discussed in terms of the various limitations and constraints on interpretation of this complex data set.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">minorities</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">hygiene</field><field name="subject">health attitudes</field><field name="subject">transcultural medical care</field><field name="subject">acculturation</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051013.095125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure, function &amp; control of the EphA3 receptor tyrosine kinase</field><field name="creator">Vearing, Christopher John</field><field name="description">The implication of the transmembrane signalling Receptor Tyrosine Kinases
(RTKs) in cancer has accelerated the pursuit for drugs to target these
molecules. In the process our understanding of how these membrane bound
molecules are entangled in cell signalling has significantly expanded. There is
now evidence that RTKs can facilitate the formation of a lattice-type network of
signalling molecules to elicit whole cell responses to external ligand stimuli.
Although beginning to be unravelled, knowledge pertaining to the mechanisms
of molecular control that initiate these signalling pathways is still in its infancy.
In this thesis, a random mutagenesis approach allowed the identification of the
crucial interaction surfaces between membrane-bound EphA3 and its
preferential binding partner ephrinA5, that are required to induce the formation
of higher-order Eph signalling complexes. Modelling and experimental
dissection of this co-ordinated receptor aggregation has provided detailed
insights into the molecular mechanisms of Eph receptor activation, which in
some aspects may also apply to other members of the RTK family. In particular,
the importance of certain molecular interfaces in determining preferential and
non-preferential Eph/ephrin interactions, suggests their role in the selection of
biologically important binding partners.
In addition to the assignment of the ephrin-interaction surfaces, the random
mutagenesis strategy also identified a continuous conformational epitope as
binding site for an anti-EphA3 monoclonal antibody. Fortuitously, antibody
binding to this site functionally mimics ephrin stimulation of EphA3 positive cells,
and in particular together with divalent ephrinA5, yields synergistically enhanced
EphA3 activation. Elucidation of the underlying mechanism has provided
opportunities to develop an efficient EphA3 targeting mechanism that is based
on increased affinity and accelerated ephrinA5 uptake as consequence of this
unique activation mechanism. On a genetic level, novel oligonucleotide
analogues known as Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNAs) were analysed for their
ability to sterically inhibit EphA3 DNA transcription and suggest a dosedependent
downregulation of EphA3 expression, in malignant melanoma cells.
Combined, ephrinA5, the anti-EphA3 MAb (IIIA4) and PNA, offer the possibility to investigate the specific machinery involved in Eph receptor expression and
signalling for the specific targeting of EphA3 expressing tumour cells.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protein kinases</field><field name="subject">Protein-tyrosine kinases</field><field name="subject">Drug receptors</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051017.094940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Treatment of printing ink wastewater using high liquid carryover mode function</field><field name="creator">Ang, Choon Jek</field><field name="description">The aim of this project is to investigate the feasibility of the use of a novel process of high liquid carryover (HLC) mode flotation to treat wastewater from a cardboard printing and coating plant. This is conducted by characterising the process conditions with the purpose of achieving a set condition that have a low susceptibility to variability in the wastewater composition. Information pertaining to the surface and physical characteristics of the solid contained in the wastewater sample were used to explain the flotation outcomes. Fe(II) was found to be more suited for industrial use as coagulant over the more commonly known coagulants, Al(III) and Fe(III), as it has the advantages of having a constant optimum flotation pH (6.5) regardless of wastewater characteristics, as well as having a much lower detrimental effect on the flotation outcome when present in excess of the minimum requirement for flocculation of wastewater solids. This allows the setting of a coagulant dose (5 mM) that will treat both high and low solids content wastewater samples. The use of cationic surfactant (CTAB) was found to require lower coagulant dosages compared to those required for anionic (SDS) or non-ionic (TericG12A8) surfactants in order to achieve good flotation outcomes. A CTAB concentration of 300 ppm was required to achieve a stable foam that can sustain for a prolonged period to allow solid (in foam)/liquid separation. The optimum batch mode conditions for HLC flotation were found to be pH 6.5, 5 mM Fe(II) and 300 ppm CTAB. This was found to correspond to a small and negative electrophoretic mobility at the wastewater solid surface and large floc size. Batch mode flotation of individual ink components under the optimum conditions for industrial wastewater treatment revealed that the presence of large quantities of either blue or yellow inks in the wastewater can lead to poor removal. Their combined presence, however, did not have detrimental effects. Continuous mode flotation at 5 mM Fe(II), 300 ppm CTAB and pH 6.5 was found to remove above 96% of contaminants at cell residence times of 6 minutes and 88% of contaminants at cell residence times of 1.5 minute. Greater than 87% of the initial wastewater volumes were recovered as treated effluent (i.e. &lt; 13% disposed as waste foam sludge), yielding a waste foam sludge containing between 12 and 17% solids. The best flotation outcomes were achieved when all the wastewater volume entering the flotation cell leaves the cell with the foam.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Factory and trade waste</field><field name="subject">Purification</field><field name="subject">Printing ink</field><field name="subject">Flotation</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051017.115207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fast solver for large systems of linear equations for finite element analysis on unstructured meshes</field><field name="creator">Iwamura, Chihiro</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis is to develop a more efficient solver for a large system of linear equations arising from finite element discretization on unstructured tetrahedral meshes for a scalar elliptic partial differential equation of second order for pressure in a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation.

Segregated solution methods (or pressure correction type methods) are a widely used approach to obtain solutions of Navier-Stokes equations during numerical simulation by many commercial CFD codes. At each time step, these simulations usually require the approximate solution of a series of scalar equations for velocity, pressure and temperature. Even if the simulation does not require high-accuracy approximations, the large systems of linear equations for pressure may not be efficiently solved. The matrices of these systems of linear equations of real-life industry problems often strongly violate weak diagonal dominance and the numerical simulation often requires solutions of very large systems with over a few hundred thousands degrees of freedom. These conditions produce very ill-conditioned systems of linear equations. Therefore, it is very difficult to solve such systems of linear equations efficiently using most currently available common iterative solvers.

A survey of solvers for systems of linear equations was undertaken to determine the preferred solution methodology. An algebraic multigrid preconditioned conjugate gradient (AMGPCG) method solver was chosen for these problems. This solver uses the algebraic multigrid (AMG) cycle as a preconditioner for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. The disadvantages of the conventional AMG method are an expensive setup time and large memory requirements, particularly for three dimensional problems. The disadvantage of an expensive setup time needs to be overcome because the simulation usually requires only low-accuracy approximations for pressure. Also it is important to overcome the disadvantage of the large memory requirements for use in commercial software.

In this work, an efficient AMGPCG solver is developed by overcoming the disadvantages of the conventional AMG method. The robustness of AMGPCG is shown theoretically so that the solver is always convergent. Optimum or close to optimum rates of convergence behavior for the solver are shown numerically so that the number of necessary iterations to obtain the estimated solution is approximately independent of mesh resolution. Furthermore, numerical experiments of solving pressure for some industry problems were carried out and compared with other efficient solvers including a fast commercial AMGPCG solver (SAMG, release 20b1). It was found that the developed AMGPCG solver was the fastest among these solvers for solving these problems and its algorithm has been numerically proven to be efficient. In addition, the memory requirement is at an acceptable level for commercial CFD codes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Finite element method</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Multigrid methods (Numerical analysis)</field><field name="subject">Numerical solutions</field><field name="subject">Differential equations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051020.091538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brain electrical activity and automization</field><field name="creator">Hocking, Christopher Anthony</field><field name="description">Novices and experts show distinct differences in the performance of many tasks. Experts may perform a task quickly and accurately with seemingly little attention or effort, whilst novices will perform the same task more slowly and with great effort. The transition from novice to expert performance occurs only after extended practice and has been conceptualized as a transition from controlled to automatic processing, and has been modeled as a reduction in attention or cognitive resources. Alternatively, based on findings relating to learning in the domain of number arithmetic, it has also been modeled as a transition from an algorithmic, or computationally-based process, to the use of memory retrieval. 

However, relatively few studies have investigated the changes in brain activity associated with such a transition. In this study, the Steady-State Probe Topography technique was used to investigate differences in the topography of the Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) between an unpracticed and a well-practiced analogue of number arithmetic, Alphabet arithmetic. 

Subjects showed decreases in response time with practice that followed a power law and were suggestive of automatization. During initial, unpracticed performance of the task, processing of the Alphabet Arithmetic equations was characterised by increased SSVEP amplitude and decreased latency in frontal regions, whilst after extended practice, performance was characterised by reduced SSVEP amplitude and increased latency. It is suggested that the frontal activity during the initial, unpracticed stage of the task implicates a role for working memory, whilst the amplitude decrease and latency increase observed in the well-practiced task may reflect a reduction in excitation, consistent with ideas of an improvement in brain efficiency, and possibly an increase in inhibitory processes.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electroencephalography</field><field name="subject">Evoked potentials (Electrophysiology)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051021.110535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of trichloroethene destruction for the degreasing industry</field><field name="creator">Binner, Eleanor</field><field name="description">The major objective of this project was to assess the application of atmospheric

The GHQ-12 is one of the most widely used instruments for determining wellbeing in populations. The response format of the GHQ-12 comprises four ordinal categories and underlying distributions of data obtained invariably do not approximate univariate or multivariate normality. Owing to these data properties, consideration should be given to the application of appropriate statistical approaches for analyzing this type of data sets. This study also investigates the extent to which the GHQ-12 is invariant across gender and cultural groups. 

A three-dimensional measurement model for the GHQ-12 was initially examined for four groups of Australian immigrants who originated from Hong Kong (n = 201), Mainland China (n =213), former Yugoslavia (n = 259), and the United Kingdom (n = 428).  A series of CFAs using either a Pearson&#65533;s product-moment or a polychoric correlation input matrix and employing either maximum likelihood (ML), weighted least squares (WLS) or diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) estimation methods was conducted on the data.  A comparison of the parameter estimates and goodness-of-fit statistics obtained for the different analyses provided support for using polychoric correlation input matrices and DWLS estimation in CFAs when analyzing ordinal, nonnormal data with smaller sample sizes.  
Invariance tests across gender and cultural groups were conducted on a second-order measurement model for the GHQ-12, culminating in significant differences between the two Asian and two European cohorts. The GHQ-12 was invariant for immigrants from Hong Kong and Mainland China, as well as for males and females from the United Kingdom. Partial invariance of the GHQ-12 was found for immigrants from Asia, the United Kingdom, and former Yugoslavia and for Asian males and females. 

Findings from the present study suggest that estimating models based on nonnormal ordinal responses using polychoric correlations with DWLS is more likely to result in a solution with higher parameter estimates and better indices of fit than other approaches. Further research should be conducted on real and simulated data to investigate the efficacy of WLS and DWLS estimation in CFAs when using polychoric correlations as the input data for varying categorical response formats, with a range of model and sample sizes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health surveys</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Questionnaires</field><field name="subject">Factor analysis</field><field name="subject">Immigrants</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051025.122616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contaminant levels in recycled PET plastic</field><field name="creator">Konkol, Lidia</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis was to determine which contaminants were present in washed and dried shredded poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET, flake) obtained from curbside collection and to determine whether their concentrations were above the US FDA threshold of 215 ppb. Over thirty semi-volatile contaminants were extracted from the treated flake by Soxhlet extraction using dichloromethane as a PET swelling solvent and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy for identification and quantification. Soxhlet extraction of flake ground to 0-300 &#65533;m was effectively completed by 24 h, whereas sonication reduced the extraction time to 3 h. In contrast Soxhlet extractions on flake ground to a larger particle size range (&gt;300-425 &#65533;m and &gt;425-700 &#65533;m) were completed within four hours, possibly due to less aggregation in the extraction thimble. In the finely ground flake (0-300 &#65533;m) the levels of most contaminants were below 215 ppb, but six were not. Dodecanoic acid was present at about 1200 ppb, 2-butoxyethanol was approximately 1000 ppb, limonene, benzophenone and methylsalicylate were above 800 ppb and 2-methylnaphthalene near 215 ppb. After analogous method development the levels of all diffusible compounds in extruded PET pellets were below the threshold of 215 ppb. 

The Soxhlet extraction technique was validated by comparison with total dissolution by TFA for two of the three particle size ranges obtained by grinding the PET flake (&gt;300-425 &#65533;m and &gt;425-700 &#65533;m) and for the unground flake. Further validation was achieved by the comparison of contaminant levels determined by total dissolution with TFA and sonication with DCM using flake ground to the 0-300 &#65533;m size range. The levels of contaminants were found to increase with decreasing particle size range, but XRD measurements of degrees of crystallinity were similar for each PET particle size range, thus showing that the differences in contaminant levels were not due to variable percentages of the amorphous material from the tops and bottoms of shredded bottles, relative to the amounts of crystalline PET from the mid-sections of the bottles. Hence it was postulated that the variations in contaminant levels were due to selective grinding of the more highly contaminated surfaces, whilst the larger particles incorporated the less contaminated interior material.

The analysis of the more homogenous annealed (extruded) pellets indicated that contaminant levels between the analogous particle size ranges were equivalent. This observation validated our interpretation of the high levels of contaminants found in finely ground flake being due to selective surface grinding where high levels are expected. When analysing volatiles, static headspace analysis was performed on flake and extruded pellets due to the limitations surrounding SPME. External standardisation was used as the method of quantification and the levels of toluene, undecane and p-xylene in extruded pellets were found to be below 38 ppb and therefore within the 215 ppb FDA-set threshold for flake and pellets.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polyethylene terephthalate</field><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="subject">Plastics</field><field name="subject">Recycling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051025.142051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the effectiveness of implementing video conferencing over IP</field><field name="creator">Meulenberg, Paul Martin Charles</field><field name="description">Nobody really knows with certainty what education using digital video communication technology will be like in the next ten years. The only thing that seems certain is that it will not be like the present. While no one can see into the future, we can research present realities and current rates of change as bases for projecting ahead. 

Video conference systems that operate over IP (Internet Protocol) are being implemented in educational organisations, businesses and homes around the globe. Video conference manufacturers inform us that the implementation of such systems and their use is relatively straightforward. This may or may not be the case. This research argues that there is significantly more to implementing video conferencing over IP than simply installing the equipment, training staff and commencing classes. This study reports on an investigation into the effectiveness of implementing digital video conferencing over IP in educational institutions. It specifically looks at this in respect of the desktop and small group user. Research in desktop videoconferencing in education exists but is not abundant, for example, Thompson (1996), Kies et al., (1997), Bogen et al., (1997), Daunt (1999), Davis and Kelly (2002), Davis et al., (2004). With the considerable progress made in IP technologies, more educational providers are moving to use desktop and small group videoconference systems to link to classes and/or students over the Internet. This is a trend that is growing rapidly world-wide. The implementation and application of IP video conferencing in education is under-researched. This study examines three separate case studies to collect the required data. It looks at the processes required to set up effective communications with students and teachers using digital media. It identifies the specific difficulties that need to be overcome, both technically as well as the human factors that are involved. It addresses these issues chiefly as related to desktop users and small groups of participants in particular. In conclusion it also focuses on the design aspects of the video conference equipment and venues used in educational environments. The aim of the research, therefore, is to understand current and future trends of implementing and using video conferencing over IP, in a technical, human and design sense. The research has practical significance for educational institutions, as it provides useful information for students, tutors, technicians and designers involved in digital video conferencing technologies now, and in the years to come.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teleconferencing in education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Education (Higher)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051025.144820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multivariate study of the relationship between organizational learning, organizational innovation and organizational climate in the Australian hospitality industry</field><field name="creator">Subramaniam, Revati</field><field name="description">This multi-method study investigated the relationship between the dimensions of organizational learning, organizational innovation and organizational climate in the Australian Hotel Industry.

The hotel industry was chosen as it is highly labour intensive and serves as a suitable environment to test the three dependent variables that are closely employee related.
Data was collected from a total population sample of 800 respondents, employed in 50 hotels, which included 45 from a large International Brewery Group located in Melbourne and 5 independent hotels. The response rate was 75%. 

Organizational learning was measured using, the 34-item Organizational Learning Profile (OLP) scale (Pace et al, 1997) containing the four dimensions of OL (Achievement Mindset, Learning Practices, Information Sharing Patterns, and Inquiry Climate) was used.

Organizational Innovation was measured using the 24- item Workplace Innovation Scale (WIS) (McMurray and Dorai, 2002) containing the four dimensions of Innovation (Organizational Innovation, Innovation Climate, Team Innovation and Individual Innovation).

Organizational Climate (OC) was measured using the 40 item Koys and DeCotiis (1996) scale containing the eight dimensions of support, autonomy, pressure, cohesion, recognition, fairness, innovation and trust. 

Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS (v.10) and qualitative data was analyzed using theme-category analysis. 

This study contributes to the management literature and extends the existing knowledge on learning, innovation and climate. 

Specifically the results show that the dimensions of organizational learning, innovation and climate are predictors of one another and it establishes a significant relationship between the dimensions of learning, innovation and climate.

Furthermore, this study found that Workplace Survey is a valid and reliable scale to measure learning, innovation and climate. 

The recommendations made in this study will help management understand the importance of learning and innovation in the workplace. In turn, this will improve the organizational climate by facilitating learning and innovation among hotel employees.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hospitality industry</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Organizational learning</field><field name="subject">Technological innovations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051025.151937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational contestation over the discursive construction of equal employment opportunities for women in three Victorian public authorities</field><field name="creator">Hinton, Susan E.</field><field name="description">The central arguments in this thesis rest on two premises.

This study aimed to investigate the psychological well-being of people with MS with an emphasis on positive psychological functioning. It also aimed to extend previous research that suggested reporting perceived benefits during adversity may be indicative of cognitive adaptation. Disease-related variables (mobility, fatigue) and psychosocial factors (optimism, coping) were examined to ascertain the effects of living with MS upon well-being. Well-being was determined using two general measures (The Profile of Mood States (POMS), Shacham, 1983; and the Ryff Psychological Well-being Scale (PWB), Ryff &amp; Keyes, 1995), and Mohr et al.&#65533;s (1999) MS psychosocial factors (Demoralization, Deteriorated Relationships, Benefit Finding). Participants were 154 people with MS who were recruited through the MS Societies of Victoria and Tasmania. Results showed participants reported both negative and positive consequences from their MS experiences. Higher levels of Demoralization and Deteriorated Relationships were related to decreased well-being. However, no association was found between Benefit Finding and psychological well-being. Benefit Finding was also unrelated to optimism, and the disease-related variables (mobility, fatigue). Only positive reappraisal coping was predictive of reporting of benefits which lends support to the notion that it is a coping strategy. To examine the effects of mobility the sample was divided into three groups: normal gait, mild gait problems but not using aids and those who require aids for mobility. Significant differences between the mobility groups were found on Demoralization and fatigue levels. As participants&#65533; difficulties with mobilisation increased so too did their levels of demoralisation. However, those with mild gait problems reported fatigue levels comparable with those experiencing more complex gait difficulties. No differences were found between the groups on the general psychological measures, which may indicate some form of resilience or psychological adaptation occurring. More generally, results showed that participants who were more optimistic, less fatigued, and used less of particular coping strategies (either less avoidant coping or less blaming self or others) to deal with their MS problems reported higher well-being (less demoralisation, less psychological distress and higher positive functioning). In conclusion, the use of multi-dimensional outcomes enabled a comprehensive examination of well-being and highlighted the effects of specific illness-related factors and coping strategies. As demonstrated in this study, despite the adversity of living with MS, people are able to maintain a healthy sense of self and their relationships, and report benefits from their experiences.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multiple sclerosis</field><field name="subject">Patients</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051103.161133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Image analysis of fungal biostructure by fractal and wavelet techniques</field><field name="creator">Jones, Cameron Lawrence</field><field name="description">Filamentous fungal colonies show a remarkable diversity of different mycelial branching patterns. To date, the characterization of this biostructural complexity has been based on subjective descriptions. Here, computerized image analysis in conjunction with video microscopy has been used to quantify several aspects of fungal growth and differentiation. This was accomplished by applying the new branch of mathematics called Fractal Geometry to this biological system, to provide an objective description of morphological and biochemical complexity. The fractal dimension is useful for describing irregularity and shape complexity in systems that appear to display scaling correlations (between structural units) over several orders of length or size. The branching dynamics of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus have been evaluated using fractals in order to determine whether there was a correlation between branching complexity and the amount of extracellular phenol-oxidase that accumulated during growth.

A non-linear branching response was observed when colonies were grown in the presence of the aminoanthraquinone dye, Remazol Brilliant Blue R. Branching complexity could be used to predict the generalized yield of phenol-oxidase that 

accumulated in submerged culture, or identify paramorphogens that could be used to improve yield. A method to optimize growth of discrete fungal colonies for microscopy and image analysis on microporous membranes revealed secretion sites of the phenoloxidase, laccase as well as the intracellular enzyme, acid phosphatase. This method was further improved using microwave-accelerated heating to detect tip and sheath bound enzyme.

The spatial deposition of secreted laccase and acid phosphatase displayed antipersistent scaling in deposition and/or secretion pattern. To overcome inherent statistical limitations of existing methods, a new signal processing tool, called wavelets were applied to analyze both one and two-dimensional data to measure fractal scaling. Two-dimensional wavelet packet analysis (2-d WPA) measured the (i) mass fractal dimension of binary images, or the (ii) self-affine dimension of grey-scale images. Both 1- and 2-d WPA showed comparative accuracy with existing methods yet offered improvements in computational efficiency that were inherent with this multiresolution technique.

The fractal dimension was shown to be a sensitive indicator of shape complexity. The discovery of power law scaling was a hallmark of fractal geometry and in many cases returned values that were indicative of a self-organized critical state. This meant that the dynamics of fungal colony branching equilibrium. Hence there was potential for biostructural changes of all sizes, which would allow the system to efficiently adapt to environmental change at both the macro and micro levels.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Funghi</field><field name="subject">Physiology</field><field name="subject">Wavelets (Mathematics)</field><field name="subject">Branching processes</field><field name="subject">Fractals</field><field name="subject">Biology</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Spatial analysis (Statistics)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051107.093036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trust and the Australian retail banking industry : the impact of deinstitutionalisation of Australian retail banking services on consumer trust</field><field name="creator">Parker, Lukas Jay</field><field name="description">Consumer trust research has principally developed from established psychological-based research. This conception of consumer trust largely draws from research pertaining to interpersonal trust. This study combined existing
theories from both sociological and psychological research in developing a consumer trust model specifically for banks.

Partly because of their historical position in society and also because of their
government-protected position, banks, bank branches and bank managers have traditionally held a respected, and trusted position in Australian communities. Because of this reputation and position in communities, banks were seen to display institutional attributes. These attributes were defined in this study as local community focus, local availability and visibility, relationship power symmetry and social obligation fulfilment.

This study explored the notion of institution-based trust in an Australian retail banking context. Institution-based trust was a measure of the levels of consumer trust in various defined institutional attributes. It was contended that through the diminishment and divestment of its institutional attributes banks were impairing their institutional cachet. The process was termed 'deinstitutionalisation' and was postulated to have a negative impact on consumer trust.

The hypothetico-deductive methodological framework was employed throughout the study, with a mail-based consumer survey used as the main means of primary data collection. 468 useable questionnaires from adult bank customers were yielded and the data analysed. These data were analysed and used to test twenty-three
research hypotheses of which nineteen were supported.

From the results, it was concluded that perceived local community focus, perceived social obligation fulfilment and perceived relationship power symmetry were antecedents to consumer trust in banks. Also, reasonable availability of conventional bank branch services was found to be an important component of perceived community focus of their banks, thus having an indirect relationship to
institution-based consumer trust in banks. Community Banks were found to be exhibiting and promoting many of these institutional attributes.

Consumers were found to be less likely to need bank branches for transactional or functional purposes, but branches were seen to be symbolically important. Also, consumers were found to be more likely to identify with intangible elements of their bank, principally bank brand, than with tangible attributes such as the bank branch. Importantly, consumers were found to be trusting of their banks, however
they were more likely to believe that banks were less trustworthy now than they were in the past.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer loyalty</field><field name="subject">Relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">Bank marketing</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051117.105403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the introduction of the graphics calculator on system wide 'high stakes' end of secondary school mathematics examinations</field><field name="creator">Brown, Roger George</field><field name="description">There has been widespread interest in the potential impact of the graphics calculator on system wide 'high stakes' end of secondary school mathematics examinations. This thesis has focused on one aspect, the way in which examiners have gone about writing examination questions in a graphics calculator assumed environment. Two aspects of this issue have been investigated. The first concerns the types of questions that can be asked in a graphics calculator assumed environment and their frequency of use. The second addresses the level of skills assessed and whether with the
introduction of the graphics calculator has been associated with an increase in difficulty as has been frequently suggested. A descriptive case study methodology was used with three examination
boards, the Danish Ministry of Education, Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority and the International Baccalaureate Organization.

Four distinct categories of questions were identified which differed according to the potential for the graphics calculator to contribute to the solution of the question and the freedom the student was then given to make use of this potential. While all examination boards made use of the full range of questions, the tendency was to under use questions in which required the use of the calculator for their solution. In respect to the level of skills assessed, it was found that both prior to and after the introduction of the graphics calculator, all three examination boards used question types that primarily tested the use of lower level mathematical skills. With exceptions, where graphics calculator active questions have been used, the tendency has been to continue to ask routine mechanistic questions. In this regard, there is no evidence of the introduction of the graphics calculator being associated with either lowering or raising of the level of the mathematical skills assessed.

For all cases studied, the graphics calculator was introduced with minimal change to the curriculum and examination policies. The role of the graphics calculator in the enacted curriculum was left implicit. The resulting examinations were consistent with the stated policies. However, the inexperience of some examiners and a general policy of containment or minimal change enabled examiners to minimise the impact of the introduction of the graphics calculators on assessment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Calculators</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching (Secondary)</field><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Data processing</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Denmark</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051117.121210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who goes there? : demographics, personality and attachment style of those involved in internet affairs</field><field name="creator">Underwood, Heather</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis was to explore the impact of Internet relationships on regular ongoing relationships from the point of view of those engaged in such relationships.  Two studies were conducted. A sample of 75 participants, including 22 females and 53 males who were married or living in defacto relationships and ranging in age from 18 to 75 years completed an anonymous online survey for
Study One. Demographic characteristics, frequency and method of communication and relationship satisfaction were investigated. Questions were asked about Internet relationship formation. Respondents were asked to gauge levels of self-disclosure within their regular ongoing relationship and their online relationship. They were also asked about the proximity and physical attractiveness of their online partner. It was found that most respondents communicated daily, were more satisfied with their Internet partner than their regular ongoing partner, considered their Internet partner physically attractive
and communicated in a highly intimate manner. The purpose of the second study was to investigate the similarities and differences between the personality characteristics and
attachment styles of respondents. Participants in the second study were 133 respondents
who were married or living in defacto relationships, including 47 females and 86 males
ranging in age from 18 years to 66 years. Respondents completed an anonymous online survey, which included measures of personality (e.g. the International Personality Item
Pool, Goldberg, 1999), the Relationship Satisfaction questionnaire (Hendrick, 1988), and
the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale (Brennan, Clark, &amp; Shaver, 1998). Respondents were found to be somewhat more agreeable and conscientious, and less narcissistic than previous research had found to be the case for those individuals who engaged in face-to-face infidelity.  The preoccupied attachment group was well represented, but was less differentiated from the other attachment groups than was the fearful group, who were mainly female. The personality profile and attachment style of respondents in Study Two was, therefore, found to be different in important ways from that which has been associated with face-to-face infidelity. Findings were discussed in terms of methodological implications, suggestions for future research and also implications for Counselling Psychologists.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attachment behavior</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal relations</field><field name="subject">Man-woman relationships</field><field name="subject">Computer network resources</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051124.091812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphology dependent resonance of a microscope and its application in near-field scanning optical microscopy</field><field name="creator">Morrish, Dru</field><field name="description">In recent times, near-field optical microscopy has received increasing attention for its
ability to obtain high-resolution images beyond the diffraction limit. Near-field optical
microscopy is achieved via the positioning and manipulation of a probe on a scale less
than the wavelength of the incident light.

Despite many variations in the mechanical design of near-field optical microscopes almost all rely on direct mechanical access of a cantilever or a derivative form to probe the sample. This constricts the study to surface examinations in simple sample environments. Distance regulation between the sample surface and the delicate probe
requires its own feedback mechanism. Determination of feedback is achieved through
monitoring the shift of resonance of one arm of a 'tuning fork', which is caused by the interaction of the probes tip with the Van der Waals force. Van der Waals force emanates from atom-atom interaction at the top of the sample surface. Environmental contamination of the sample surface with additional molecules such as water makes accurate measurement of these forces particularly challenging. The near-field study of
living biological material is extremely difficult as an aqueous environment is required for its extended survival. Probe-sample interactions within an aqueous environment that
result in strong detectable signal is a challenging problem that receives considerable
attention and is a focus of this thesis.

In order to increase the detectible signal a localised field enhancement in the probing region is required. The excitation of an optically resonant probe by morphology dependent resonance (MDR) provides a strong localised field enhancement. Efficient MDR excitation requires important coupling conditions be met, of which the localisation of the incident excitation is a critical factor.

Evanescent coupling by frustrated total internal reflection to a MDR microcavity provides an ideal method for localised excitation. However it has severe drawbacks if the probe is to be manipulated in a scanning process. Tightly focusing the incident illumination by a high numerical aperture objective lens provides the degree of freedom to enable both MDR excitation and remote manipulation. Two-photon nonlinear excitation is shown to couple efficiently to MDR modes due to the high spatial localisation of the incident excitation in three-dimensions. The dependence of incident excitation localisation by high numerical aperture objective on MDR efficiency is thoroughly examined in this thesis. The excitation of MDR can be enhanced by up to 10 times with the localisation of the incident illumination from the centre of the
microcavity to its perimeter.

Illuminating through a high numerical aperture objective enables the remote noninvasive
manipulation of a microcavity probe by laser trapping. The transfer of photon momentum from the reflection and refraction of the trapping beam is sufficient enough to exert piconewtons of force on a trapped particle. This allows the particle to be held and scanned in a predictable fashion in all three-dimensions. Optical trapping
removes the need for invasive mechanical access to the sample surface and provides a means of remote distance regulation between the trapped probe and the sample. The femtosecond pulsed beam utilised in this thesis allows the simultaneous induction of two-photon excitation and laser trapping. It is found in this thesis that a MDR microcavity can be excited and translated in an efficient manner. The application of this technique to laser trapped near-field microscopy and single molecule detection is of particular interest.

Monitoring the response of the MDR signal as it is scanned over a sample object enables a near-field image to be built up. As the enhanced evanescent field from the propagation of MDR modes around a microcavity interacts with different parts of the sample, a measurable difference in energy leakage from the cavity modes occurs. The definitive spectral properties of MDR enables a multidimensional approach to imaging and sensing, a focus of this thesis. Examining the spectral modality of the MDR signal
can lead to a contrast enhancement in laser trapped imaging. Observing a single MDR mode during the scanning process can increase the image contrast by up to 1:23 times compared to that of the integrated MDR fluorescence spectrum.

The work presented in this thesis leads to the possibility of two-photon fluorescence
excitation of MDR in combination with laser trapping becoming a valuable tool in near-
field imaging, sensing and single molecule detection in vivo. It has been demonstrated
that particle scanned, two-photon fluorescence excitation of MDR, by laser trapping 'tweezers' can provide a contrast enhancement and multiple imaging modalities. The spectral imaging modality has particular benefits for image contrast enhancements.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laser manipulation (Nuclear physics)</field><field name="subject">Near-field microscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051124.121838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel strategies for surface micromachining TiN thin films deposited by filtered arc</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Andrew John</field><field name="description">TiN is used commercially as a wear resistant coating on cutting tools and as a diffusion
barrier in microelectronics. TiN has gained increased interest as a material for MEMS,
however there has been very little work carried out in the area of patterning and releasing TiN for use as a structural MEMS material.

This thesis presents an investigation into the patterning and release of filtered arc deposited TiN thin films using surface micromachining techniques. Two novel strategies are presented for patterning TiN thin films and are achieved using excimer laser micromachining and photolithographic wet-etching.

TiN was deposited onto single crystal Si and Cr and Cu sacrificial layers on Si. The use of Cr as a sacrificial layer was found to facilitate the best quality patterning of the TiN and hence the majority of the work involved using Cr sacrificial layers.

TiN was deposited using partial filtration and full filtration and differences in the ability
to selectively laser pattern the TiN from the Cr sacrificial layer are presented. Various
analytical techniques were employed to investigate the origin of the difference in laser
patterning the TiN thin films.

The establishment of TiN and Cr as a novel material combination for surface micromachined MEMS was extended by etching the Cr sacrificial layer to facilitate the release of TiN stress-measurement structures.

The major finding of this thesis is that filtered arc deposited TiN thin film on Cr can be
used as a material combination to surface micromachine freestanding TiN structures as
high quality patterning and etch selectivity can be achieved using both excimer laser
micromachining and photolithographic wet-etching.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thin films</field><field name="subject">Micromachining</field><field name="subject">Titanium nitride</field><field name="subject">Protective coatings</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051129.085933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ritual and politics in new order Indonesia : a study of discourse and counter-discourse in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Mundayat, Aris Arif</field><field name="description">This thesis will examine the more active role played in Java by the urban wong cilik (the underclass; literally, the 'little people') in contesting the state&#65533;s authority,
particularly during the later years of the New Order regime, and following its demise in
1998. I will provide examples of social practices employed by the wong cilik in their
everyday lives and in their adaptation to periods of significant social and political
upheaval. These demonstrate the ways in which they are able to contest the state&#65533;s efforts
to impose its authority. These practices also develop and employ a variety of subversive
discourses, whose categories and values diverge significantly from the official language
of government. The examination of the relative linguistic, cultural and normative
autonomy of the seemingly powerless underclass reveals an extremely contested political
terrain in which the wong cilik are active rather than passive agents in urban society.
These ideas have developed out of urban field research sited around warungs
(sidewalk food stalls), urban kampongs and in the city streets of the three Javanese cities
of Yogyakarta, Surabaya, and Jakarta. These urban social spaces will be shown to be
significant for the underclass because they constitute sites through which they constantly
interact with diverse social groups, thereby sharpening their knowledge of the
contradictions and feelings of otherness manifest between the classes in Java&#65533;s large
cities. It will be shown how, in these spaces, the underclass also experience the state&#65533;s
attempts at control through various officially sanctioned projects and how the underclass
are able to subvert those projects through expressive means such as songs, poems and
forms of mockery which combine to make the state&#65533;s dominant discourses lose much of
their efficacy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religion and politics</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Java (Indonesia)</field><field name="subject">Elite (Social sciences)</field><field name="subject">Minorities</field><field name="subject">Politics and government</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051129.093517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attentional bias effects following trauma exposure comparison of emotional Stroop and emotional lexical decision task paradigms</field><field name="creator">Cox, Michelle</field><field name="description">Attentional bias effects for threat and emotional words were investigated, using both the emotional Stroop and emotional lexical decision paradigms. Twenty-eight controls and twenty-eight survivors of sexual assault participated in this study, which comprised three key comparisons. First, key predictions of the threat and emotionality hypotheses were compared, in particular specific and general threat effects, and positive and negative emotionality effects. Second, two separate group comparisons were conducted, specifically controls versus survivors of sexual assault overall, and a matched subset of controls versus PTSD positive survivors of sexual assault versus PTSD negative survivors of sexual assault. Third, performance on the emotional Stroop task and emotional lexical decision task paradigms were compared directly. Slowed colour naming responses (i.e. interference) were observed for both threat effects and emotionality effects in the emotional Stroop task. For the emotional lexical decision task, slowed lexical decisions (i.e. interference) were observed for threat effects, whereas speeded lexical decisions (i.e. facilitation) were observed for emotionality effects. The findings of the current study indicate that threat and emotionality effects may co-exist in both control and survivor populations. The relationship between the presence or absence of PTSD symptoms and threat and emotionality effects requires further investigation with larger sample sizes. There may be a relationship between the presence of PTSD symptoms and specific threat effects, however the findings of the current study for general threat information were inconclusive. No relationship was evident between the presence of absence of PTSD symptoms and positive or negative emotionality effects. The current findings suggest that the emotional Stroop task may be better suited to quantifying threat effects but not emotionality effects, whereas the emotional lexical decision task appears to be able to quantify both threat and emotionality effects.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Traumatic neuroses</field><field name="subject">Patients</field><field name="subject">Rape victims</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051130.132059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Far-field and near-field optical trapping</field><field name="creator">Ganic, Djenan</field><field name="description">Optical trapping techniques have become an important and irreplaceable tool in many research disciplines for reaching non-invasively into the microscopic world and to manipulate, cut, assemble and transform micro-objects with nanometer precision and sub-micrometer resolution. Further advances in optical trapping techniques promise to bridge the gap and bring together the macroscopic world and experimental techniques and applications of Microsystems in areas of physics, chemistry and biology.

In order to understand the optical trapping process and to improve and tailor experimental techniques and applications in a variety of scientific disciplines, an accurate knowledge of trapping forces exerted on particles and their dependency on environmental and morphological factors is of crucial importance. Furthermore, the recent trend in novel laser trapping experiments sees the use of complex laser beams in trapping arrangements for achieving more controllable laser trapping techniques. Focusing of such beams with a high numerical aperture (NA) objective required for efficient trapping leads to a complicated amplitude, phase and polarisation distributions of an electromagnetic field in the focal region. Current optical trapping models based on ray optics theory and the Gaussian beam approximation are inadequate to deal with such a focal complexity.

Novel applications of the laser trapping such as the particle-trapped scanning near field optical microscopy (SNOM) and optical-trap nanometry techniques are currently investigated largely in the experimental sense or with approximated theoretical models. These applications are implemented using the efficient laser trapping with high NA and evanescent wave illumination of the sample for high resolution sensing. The proper study of these novel laser trapping applications and the potential benefits of implementation of these applications with complex laser beams requires an exact physical model for the laser trapping process and a nanometric sensing model for detection of evanescent wave scattering.

This thesis is concerned with comprehensive and rigorous modelling and characterisation of the trapping process of spherical dielectric particles implemented using far-field and near-field optical trapping modalities. Two types of incident illuminations are considered, the plane wave illumination and the doughnut beam illumination of various topological charges. The doughnut beams represent one class of complex laser beams. However, our optical trapping model presented in this thesis is in no way restricted to this type of incident illumination, but is equally applicable to other types of complex laser beam illuminations. Furthermore, the thesis is concerned
with development of a physical model for nanometric sensing, which is of great importance for optical trapping systems that utilise evanescent  field illumination for achieving high resolution position monitoring and imaging. 

The nanometric sensing model, describing the conversion of evanescent photons into propagating photons, is realised using an analytical approach to evanescent wave scattering by a microscopic particle. The effects of an interface at which the evanescent wave is generated are included by considering the scattered  
field reflection from the interface. Collection and imaging of the resultant scattered field by a high numerical aperture objective is described using vectorial diffraction theory. Using our sensing model, we have investigated the dependence of the scattering on the particle size and refractive index, the effects of the interface on the scattering cross-section, morphology dependent resonance effects associated with the scattering process, and the effects of the incident angle of a laser beam undergoing total internal reflection to generate an evanescent field. Furthermore, we have studied the detectability of the scattered signal using a wide area detector and a pinhole detector. A good agreement between our experimental measurements of the focal intensity distribution in the back focal region of the collecting objective and the theoretical predictions confirm the validity of our approach.

The optical trapping model is implemented using a rigorous vectorial diffraction theory for characterisation of the electromagnetic field distribution in the focal region of a high NA objective. It is an exact model capable of considering arbitrary amplitude, phase and polarisation of the incident laser beam as well as apodisation functions of the focusing objective. The interaction of a particle with the complex focused field is described by an extension of the classical plane wave Lorentz-Mie theory with the expansion of the incident field requiring numerical integration of finite surface integrals only. The net force exerted on the particle is then determined using the Maxwell stress tensor approach. Using the optical trapping model one can
consider the laser trapping process in the far-field of the focusing objective, also known as the far-field trapping, and the laser trapping achieved by focused evanescent field, i.e. near-field optical trapping.

Investigations of far-field laser trapping show that spherical aberration plays a significant role in the trapping process if a refractive index mismatch exists between the objective immersion and particle suspension media. An optical trap efficiency is severely degraded under the presence of spherical aberration. However, our study shows that the spherical aberration effect can be successfully dealt with using our optical trapping model. Theoretical investigations of the trapping process achieved using an obstructed laser beam indicate that the transverse trapping efficiency decreases rapidly with increasing size of the obstruction, unlike the trend predicted using a ray optics model. These theoretical investigations are in a good agreement with our experimentally observed results.

Far-field optical trapping with complex doughnut laser beams leads to reduced lifting force for small dielectric particles, compared with plane wave illumination, while for large particles it is relatively unchanged. A slight advantage of using a doughnut laser beam over plane wave illumination for far-field trapping of large dielectric particles manifests in a higher forward axial trapping efficiency, which increases for increasing doughnut beam topological charge. It is indicated that the maximal transverse trapping efficiency decreases for reducing particle size and that the rate of decrease is higher for doughnut beam illumination, compared with plane wave illumination, which has been confirmed by experimental measurements. 

A near-field trapping modality is investigated by considering a central obstruction placed before the focusing objective so that the obstruction size corresponds to the minimum convergence angle larger than the critical angle. This implies that the portion of the incident wave that is passed through the high numerical aperture objective satisfies the total internal reflection condition at the surface of the coverslip, so that only a focused evanescent field is present in the particle suspension medium. Interaction of this focused near-field with a dielectric micro-particle is described and investigated using our optical trapping model with a central obstruction. Our investigation shows that the maximal backward axial trapping efficiency or the lifting
force is comparable to that achieved by the far-field trapping under similar conditions for either plane wave illumination or complex doughnut beam illumination. The dependence of the maximal axial trapping efficiency on the particle size is nearly linear for near-field trapping with focused evanescent wave illumination in the Mie size regime, unlike that achieved using the far-field trapping technique.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laser manipulation (Nuclear physics)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051130.135436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I.T. investment effectiveness in education</field><field name="creator">Mason, Cecily</field><field name="description">Governments and school communities are heavily investing in information technology (IT) assuming that this will prepare their children for the workforce and in future life. This research aimed to establish an IT investment effectiveness model in the educational, domain easily applicable to schools in assessing whether their IT investments were effective. Literature research revealed a dearth of information on IT investment effectiveness in the area of education and it was therefore deemed necessary to implement an interpretive approach. Consequently a qualitative combined research methodology involving literature research, interviews, and a modified Delphi Survey I was undertaken. An initial starting point investigated the extensive business literature in IT effectiveness and IT investment particularly in small business, as most schools due to their size and budget can be categorised as thus. The information gleaned from the literature assisted in establishing a questionnaire for the interviews. Participants were selected from thirteen Victorian State, private and Catholic secondary schools that were perceived as expert in the area of IT. An in-depth three stage analysis of the interview data revealed twenty-four initial key issues. These key issues were then circulated to the participants who were requested to rate each issue using an interval scale. They were also asked to add or delete any issues, giving a rationale for their action. Participants underwent a two round process of highlighting and reassessing the key issues and the Delphi Survey was found to be valid as two new issues not identified from the interview process were raised. Based on their responses ten key issues were derived: the Principal, teachers, curriculum and IT planning, technical support, the students, the actual use of IT, training and personal development, the school council, budget, and the Learning Technologies Committee. These key issues revealed themselves as indicators or determinants of IT investment effectiveness exhibiting organisational or individual perspectives. The analysis of previous research, together with the current research findings enabled the development of a functional Model of IT Investment Effectiveness which can now be used by schools to assess their IT investment effectiveness. Finally the schools surveyed were utilising the best business IT practise and were treating IT as a strategic issue with their IT goals closely aligned and based upon the goals of the school.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information storage and retrieval systems</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051130.142153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sharing the responsibility : the role of developer contributions in the provision of lower income housing in California and its implications for Victoria</field><field name="creator">Spivak, Gary</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the relevance and transferability of developer contributed affordable housing in the USA as an alternative method of funding and delivering affordable housing in Australia.

Local Government, the vehicle for the delivery, is explored because of its central role in co-ordinating developer contributed affordable housing in the USA; and because its role in both counties as both the planning authority and a potential provider or facilitator of community housing.

Additionally, the nature and role of community based housing providers in the USA is considered important in maintaining the purpose of developer contributed affordable housing and also expanding the size of the community housing sector.

The thesis investigated developer contribution policies and programs in four Californian municipalities: San Francisco, Santa Monica, Los Angeles and San Diego. This State and these cities have established some of the most well developed programs of this type in the USA.

The investigation included controls and incentives, both mutually reinforcing, used in these Californian programs as well as operational program factors which led to their success. These were contrasted with Australian conditions to determine the relevance and transferability of the US experience.

A central conclusion was that the US developer contribution programs had limited relevance and transferability to Australia for a number of reasons. These reasons include the divergent roles, track records and legal powers of local government in the USA and Australia in planning and housing provision or facilitation; contrasting legislative frameworks and nature of housing developers between the two countries; and the lack of an imperative in Australia to develop alternatives to centrally provided public housing systems which is in contrast to the USA.

Consequently, the value of the US experience was that their particularly successful and problematic aspects of developer contributed housing programs and community housing arrangements would develop a useful context for an Australian model.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Housing policy</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Housing development</field><field name="subject">California</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051205.091306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The strategic intent of entrepreneurs
within entrepreneurially led companies
and the preconditions for their
success or failure</field><field name="creator">Ippaso, Robert A.</field><field name="description">The study is the result of a 'journey of discovery'. The fruits of an analytical and purposely open-minded
process, which sought neither to prove nor disprove some pre-existing theory, regarding
either the nature or influencing drivers of the entrepreneur and entrepreneurship; but rather progress
through a subjective review of past and current thinking on the topic. Only then, armed with that
insight, proceeded to both test and possibly re-discover the underlying evolutional and constituent
realities of this most elusive of subjects.
The desired resultant goal of this process is to help define a methodology by which to better identify
the principle traits that make up successful entrepreneurial companies and most importantly, the
individual entrepreneur(s) that lead them. Should such benchmarks show reliability of purpose, they
would certainly help provide both the Institutional and Venture Capital community with a better and
more insightfid understanding and evaluational mechanism of venture ready Entrepreneurs thereby
leading to a streamlining of their funding processes.
This process of discovery commenced by drawing on existing literature and defining what was to be
one of the principal subject matters for analysis - the nature of entrepreneurship itself and
specifically whether entrepreneurship was an 'art' or a 'science'? Was it learned or instinctive? And
whether its existence could actually be formulated, and thereby predicted.
The results of this initial process were revealingly rather ambiguous. For while alluding to the
existence of a workable methodology by which to deliver an insight into the potential success or
failure of an entrepreneurial venture, the contention that a commonality of entrepreneurial
characteristics and predispositions existed were almost entirely dismissed. As a result, the
subsequent research sought to test this perception and to identify the key constituent characteristics
and motivars of the successful entrepreneur.
To do so, a multi-dimensional entrepreneurial model was formulated and, in turn, tested through the
development of a three tiered qualitative analysis methodology. Firstly, one that encompassed a
relatively broad-based pool of approximately 45 entrepreneurs from pre-selected Small Medium
Enterprises. From this number 12 subjects were in turn further tested utilising pre-defined
methodologies; with four of them actually subjected to in-depth one on one interviews and
subsequent analysis.
Contrary to conventional thought, the evaluational amalgam of this qualitative process significantly
revealed a reliably high degree of commonality of specific traits among entrepreneurial subjects
reviewed. In addition, an exciting and valuable insight into the mind of the entrepreneur was
revealed; one that within the study is described as the 'third dimension' of entrepreneurial
motivation, and one that the author contends could unlock the door to an even deeper understanding
of this most elusive of subject matters and form a strong basis for further research.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Businessmen</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Success in business</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060109.100055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The psychological and physiological effects of yoga on children</field><field name="creator">Crowley, Anna</field><field name="description">The rise in popularity of health practices such as yoga coincides with a period of
growing publicity about the benefits of promoting positive health from an early age. Despite
this, empirical research in the field is limited. Thus, the aim of the current study was to
assess the psychological and physiological impact of a brief yoga program for children
using a randomised placebo-control design. Twenty-two school-girls aged 8-10 were
recruited to take part in a 6-session after-school program. Participants were randomly
allocated to either yoga classes or recreation classes. Heart rate change and respiration rate
were measured pre-post program as physiological indicators of relaxation. For mental
wellbeing, pre- and post-session mood and pre- and post-program self-esteem and physical
self-worth variables were assessed. Later, a replication study was conducted where yoga
was offered to the former recreation group.
Contrary to expectations, no significant changes were found on the physiological
indicators of relaxation. Global self-esteem and physical self-worth variables also remained
constant in both the yoga and recreation groups. As hypothesised, significant reductions in
anxious mood were consistently reported from the second session onwards following yoga
classes. Contrary to expectations however, depressed mood remained unchanged in either
group. Results of the follow-up study confirmed most of the findings of the main study,
except for a small improvement on the physical self-worth variable of self-perceived sports
competency, and no significant post-session mood changes. Nonetheless qualitative data
suggested that this group also experienced anxiety reduction following yoga practice.
The results of the project remain speculative because of the small sample size and
generous criteria used to determine statistical significance. Despite this, it was concluded
that while brief yoga programs might have little impact on children&#65533;s overall self-esteem or
physical self- perceptions, especially where children are physically active and already enjoy
moderate to high levels of self-esteem, yoga classes may contribute to reductions in
immediate anxiety levels. While the ability to relax voluntarily was not demonstrated by the
end of program, it was suggested that a longer yoga program which incorporated more overt
teaching of relaxation skills might produce such a result. This and other recommendations
for future research are presented and the implications for the understanding of positive
health are discussed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yoga</field><field name="subject">Hatha</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060109.105822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Ganoderma : identification, growth &amp; antibacterial properties</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Lyndal</field><field name="description">Ganoderma species are one of the most widely researched fungi because of their
reported potent bioactive properties. Although there is much information related to
American, European and Asian isolates, little research has been conducted on
Australian Ganoderma isolates. Ganoderma may only be imported into Australia under
strict quarantine conditions, therefore, the isolation of a native strain that possesses
bioactivity may be industrially and commercially significant. Three Australian species
of this wood-decomposing fungus were isolated in northern Queensland. In this study,
they have been identified as three separate species. Further, they have been studied to
determine their optimal growth conditions in liquid culture and assessed for their
antibacterial properties.
Phylogeny inferred from the Internal Transcribed Spacer Regions (ITS) from the DNA
sequences resolved the three Australian Ganoderma species into separate clades. Two
isolates were identified to be isolates of Ganoderma cupreum (H1) and Ganoderma
weberianum (H2). The third isolate could only be identified to the genus level,
Ganoderma species, due to the lack of informative data that could be used for
comparison.
The effects of short term and long term storage on the viability of the fungi were
investigated on agar plates, agar slants and balsa wood at varying temperatures ranging
from 10 to 45&#65533;C. The most appropriate storage conditions were determined to be &#65533;80&#65533;C
on balsa wood chips for periods of up to 2 years without subculture, and on agar slants
at 4&#65533;C for up to a maximum of eight weeks. Light was observed to be detrimental to the
survival of Ganoderma H1 and Ganoderma H2 during storage. Growth trials using
potato dextrose agar plates determined the optimal temperature and pH for mycelial
growth to be 30&#65533;C and a pH of 6, for all isolates. Subsequent growth trials in liquid
media found that glucose, as the carbohydrate source, supported the greatest mycelial
growth of Ganoderma H1 and Ganoderma H2 and that galactose and fructose supported
the greatest growth of Ganoderma H3.
Abstract

Aqueous (hot water) and organic (hexane (HEX), dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl
acetate (EtOAc), methanol (MeOH)) extracts from the liquid cultivated mycelium were
assessed for their antibacterial activity using disc diffusion assays. Extracts from the
mycelium of Ganoderma H1 exhibited activity against a greater number of Gram
positive bacteria than those from Ganoderma H2 and H3. Subsequent studies on the
DCM and EtOAc extracts from Ganoderma H1 determined the MIC and MBC against a
number of Gram positive bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Enterococcus
faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Listeria
monocytogenes, as well as Clostridium species, including Clostridium perfringens, C.
sporogenes and C. difficile, and some methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) strains. Time course growth assays confirmed that the DCM and EtOAc
extracts predominantly exhibited bactericidal activity. Finally, the active compounds
were determined to be terpenoid in structure with some phenolic groups attached.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ganoderma</field><field name="subject">Ganoderma diseases of plants</field><field name="subject">Ganoderma lucidum</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060109.114954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A seed of consequence : indirect image transfer and chemcial printing : the role played by lithography in the development of printing technology</field><field name="creator">Bryans, Dennis Lindsay</field><field name="description">The history of printing is dominated by studies of mechanical typography. In this thesis the role of lithography in modernising printing is presented as an alternative path. The conventional explanation of how different printing processes work is generally made by dividing them into relief, intaglio and planographic processes. This explanation is of questionable value now, in a world where digital pre-press and offset printing hold sway. 


It is an outmoded idea to think that different ways of delivering ink under pressure is at the core of printing. Instead, it is more useful to focus our attention on the role played by direct and indirect image transfer. The similarities between the uses made by Gutenberg and Senefelder of direct and indirect image transfer has a greater importance than has the simplified division of printing processes into classes based upon depth of impression which is, essentially, a mechanical idea grounded in the typographic tradition. 


The idea presented here is that Gutenberg's application of indirect image transfer in his invention of moveable type provoked changes of greater importance than did the alternative invention of printing illustrations directly from metal plates or wooden blocks. 


Similarly, direct lithography was transformed by Senefelder into a vehicle for indirect image transfer by the invention of lithographic transfer paper. This invention had important ramifications for the future of lithography and for the preservation of photographic images. The combination of chemical printing and indirect image transfer made the capture of photographic images possible for the first time. In the nineteenth century, lithography also provided the first means by which photographs could be reproduced with printing ink in books - typography following here rather than leading the way. 


These issues have not been clearly recognised by many. The widely acknowledged superiority of typography to print economically, sharply, and at speed, was not surpassed by lithographers (who tended to concentrate on technical illustration and decorative printing) for many years. It was not until indirect image transfer was applied to the lithographic press that this barrier to progress was overcome, and, at last, text and image were efficiently transferred photographically to the rotary offset press.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lithography</field><field name="subject">printing</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060118.162852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognition and the steady state visually evoked potential</field><field name="creator">Line, Per</field><field name="description">This masters thesis examines the hemispheric activation pattern of the cognitive processes involved in a complex mental rotations test (MRT) (Vandenberg and Kuse, 1978) using Steady-State Probe Topography (SSPT) (Silberstein et al, 1990) as a method to index brain activity. The Steady State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) was recorded from 64 electrode sites using a multichannel electrode helmet, and elicited by a 13 Hz sinusoidal visual flicker, whilst the subjects were performing a visual vigilance Baseline task and the MRT. Forty-one right handed subjects (twenty male and twenty-one female) were used. In the MRT the subjects were required to choose the two figures which correctly matched the criterion figure in the centre. The figures were three-dimensional objects represented in two-dimensions on a computer screen. A significant finding of this study was that when all the subjects were considered as one group, no noticeable lateralization in cerebral activation associated with mental rotation was evident. When analyzing the results for the subjects, partitioned into two groups according to gender, evidence was found suggesting that the cortical processing associated with mental rotation may be more localized bilaterally in the males than the females. However, no noticeable lateralization effects for mental rotation were found in the males or females, and hence no gender differences in hemispheric lateralization was evident. An important finding was the emergence of gender differences in hemispheric lateralization in subsets of subjects performing with higher spatial ability. A left hemisphere lateralization for mental rotation was associated with the Best Performance Male group. The Best Performance Female group showed the opposite effect, where a right hemisphere lateralization was associated with better performance on the task. The lateralization effect appeared to be stronger in the Best Performance Males than the Best Performance Females. An important conclusion from this study is that when examining for hemispheric lateralization effects in mental rotation, and possibly other visual-spatial tasks, not only gender effects need to be considered, but the level of spatial ability in the comparison groups needs also to be taken into account.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evoked potentials (electrophysiology)</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">cerebral hemispheres</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060118.170228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traffic modelling and performance of layered cellular networks with overflow</field><field name="creator">Fitzpatrick, Paul G.</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on an investigation into the teletraffic modelling and performance of layered cellular networks that use overflow for new call and handover attempts in order to improve system performance It addresses the important problems how to model and analyse overflow in large cellular networks so that the overall impact across the network can be evaluated, the overflow policies that can be used with new calls and handovers to improve network performance and how these policies perform under a range of conditions. 


The general problem of modelling overflow in cellular networks is considered at length and from this it is concluded that the use of overflow in existing schemes such as directed retry, reuse partitioning and overlaid cells can also be described by the simple concepts of intra and inter layer overflow Using these concepts the author formulates the problem of overflow in layered networks as a subset of the general problem of overflow with multiple overflow routes and restricted overflow. This leads to the derivation of the mean and variance of the overflow traffic from a cell with multiple handover routes and restricted handover from the two-dimensional birth death model of the system. 


These expressions for the mean and variance are used in conjunction with the Equivalent Random Theory and splitting formulae in the development of the Splitting Formula Method or SF Method. The accuracy of three splitting formulae and a simple Poisson approximation are investigated and compared with simulation. From this we conclude that the splitting formulae of Akimaru and Takahashi and Wallstrom provide the best overall result. This method is used to solve the general problem of multiple user classes for an example two layer network. This leads to conclusions on the complex relationship between cell capacity, the proportion of uses that can access the microcells and the proportion of users that can overflow from the microcell to the macrocell. 


The Modified Splitting Formula Method is an extension of the SF Method that includes handovers and overflow for handovers. A user perceived measure of the effect of new call and handover blocking described by the probability of call failure augments the Modified SF method. This is then used to analyse five new call overflow policies for a three layer network under conditions of extended handover, restrictions on handover for calls in cells at the edge of layers and spatial offset between the peak of the traffic demand and the cell layout. The results give new and valuable insight into the behaviour of layered cellular networks with overflow and the trade-offs in performance that exist when designing and operating these networks.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Telecommunication systems</field><field name="subject">Cellular telephone systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060119.093920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Misunderstood and mysterious : how design and designers are perceived by design professionals, design educators and the public</field><field name="creator">Smith, Gillian</field><field name="description">This study is focused on the field of design.  It examines how people understand and perceive designers and the design professions.  The study draws on a phenomenologically informed interactive perspective to provide a methodological approach to understanding what the perception of design is.  The relationships between design and occupational prestige, professional status and consumerism are the principal themes that run throughout the research, but the analysis also draws on the data obtained to profile the demographics of designers, particularly in relation to income, gender and education.  

The research included an occupational prestige assessment, completed by 304 participants from Swinburne University and the University of the Third Age, using multidimensional scaling analysis to provide a mapping of the occupations.  Overall, the results indicated that participants find it difficult to differentiate between individual design occupational specialties, but that they see design as distinct from proximate occupations such as artist and architect.  The results also confirmed the premise that occupational prestige is multi-dimensional and that raters will use a variety of constructs (including service to the community, not just education and income), to determine their understanding of the perceived social standing of occupations.  The findings were further explored within three focus group discussions involving both design and non&#65533;design students from Swinburne University.  The results indicated that most participants, including the design students, knew relatively little about design and that what they did know was often skewed by media depictions and stereotypes.  

The final research stage was the development of a mail-out survey questionnaire that was distributed to design educators, members of the Design Institute of Australia and to a non-design, public group.  Seven hundred and fifty three questionnaires were completed.  As expected the results showed that there are differences between the level of knowledge and understanding of the three participant groups.  The lack of knowledge of design and designers, particularly by the public participants, was quite evident, with the two design groups tending to rate design as more professional and of greater importance to society and the economy than the public group.  Analyses of the incomes and occupational situations of the design respondents revealed that the designers generally worked in a unique environment characterised by low to middle incomes and very small organisations (except for those in the education sector).  Gender differences between income and the positions held in an organisation were also found and would be a useful area for further investigation.  

The study was useful in that is served to clarify and quantify issues that have been raised in the literature about the poor understanding of design and designers.

gaps in our knowledge remain large and fundamental. Most studies, including those
overseas, have taken a quantitative tack, measuring the frequency and overall amount of
face-to-face contact between children and non-resident parents (mostly fathers). But
obviously there is more to parent&#65533;child contact than just time. The nature and quality of
the interaction are also important &#65533; perhaps even more so.
Recently there has been a push towards recognising and describing both qualitative
and quantitative differences in the many ways that parental sharing of time with
children can occur after divorce. This thesis attempts to identify and explore some of
these differences by comparing five different patterns of care: (i) 50/50 shared care,
(ii) little or no contact, (iii) holiday-only contact, (iv) daytime-only contact, and (v)
&#65533;standard&#65533; contact (thought to occur every-other-weekend and half of each school
holidays). A representative snapshot of parent&#65533;child contact schedules after separation
is presented to provide some of the detail of arrangements within this typology.
Two (complementary) types of data are used: qualitative data from a series of focus
groups with separated parents, and quantitative data from three large representative
samples of separated/divorced parents in Australia. Joining the dots between the
various pieces of data, there is much to suggest that family dynamics in tandem with
demographic factors temper the form that parent&#65533;child contact takes, with different
combinations of factors clearly linked to qualitatively different patterns of postseparation
parenting.
While separating parents need to be encouraged to think more laterally about what
arrangements might work best for their children and themselves, the data presented
suggest that some parents in Australia are already being very creative and there is
much diversity of arrangements. The central argument running through this
dissertation is that arrangements that allow children to experience fluid, meaningful
time with each parent are critical for children&#65533;s and parents&#65533; wellbeing.
The ideas and data presented here &#65533; especially some of the more creative timesharing
schedules developed by parents &#65533; are likely to be a useful resource for separated
parents, and the family law professionals they approach for assistance, to reflect on
when developing or refining parenting arrangements after divorce.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children of divorced parents</field><field name="subject">Custody of children</field><field name="subject">Broken homes</field><field name="subject">Divorced parents</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060214.110816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and synthesis of biodegradable thermoplastic polyurethanes for tissue engineering</field><field name="creator">Moore, Timothy Graeme</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to design and synthesise thermoplastic biodegradable and

range of degradable chain extenders was also developed and has been reported.
The polymers were characterised using Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), Instron
tensile testing, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Shore hardness. Cell
culture testing was performed as was a three-month degradation study which showed
the polyurethanes to be biocompatible and biodegradable respectively.
Selected materials were shown to be suitable for scaffold fabrication using Fused

primary fibroblast growth in vitro.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tissue engineering</field><field name="subject">Polyurethanes</field><field name="subject">Polymers</field><field name="subject">Biodegradable</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060223.121928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nasution total people's resistance and organicist thinking in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Turner, Barry John</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that General Abdul Haris Nasution, the most influential military strategist
that Indonesia has produced, developed an elective affinity between his strategies for 'people&#65533;s
resistance' and an organicist vision of the proper relations between the state (including the
military) and society that led to the Indonesian Army&#65533;s formulation of a unique, pervasive and
highly durable means of military intervention in politics, the economy and society.
Organicism is a stream of political thinking that views state and society as a single organic
unity. Corporatist / functional modes of interest representation are often associated with
organicist thinking.
Nasution&#65533;s 'people&#65533;s resistance' strategies emerged during the armed struggle for national
independence (from the Dutch) in the second half of the 1940s. The thesis argues that unlike the
'people&#65533;s war' strategies that emanated from the political left at roughly the same time,
Nasution&#65533;s concepts were designed to uphold organic 'traditional' authority structures and
depoliticise the national struggle. Associated with these strategies was a system of territorial
commands that shadowed and supervised the aristocratically led civilian administration.
The form of military intervention that grew out of this elective affinity reached its peak during
the New Order regime of former President Suharto (1966 &#65533; 1998), when the army used its
'people&#65533;s resistance' doctrines and their associated territorial commands to control the
population and the regime championed state-sanctioned corporatist / functional modes of
interest representation.
The identification of this elective affinity is a major point of departure from previous political
biographies of Nasution. Another is the emphasis placed on Nasution&#65533;s family and personal life,
particularly in the early chapters.
This thesis explains how personal and family influences encouraged Nasution towards organicist
thinking. It identifies how, in the early 1950s, Nasution idealised his 'people&#65533;s resistance'
strategies and the support given to him during the armed struggle by organic 'traditional'
authority figures. It shows how Nasution&#65533;s elective affinity between organicist thinking and
'people&#65533;s resistance' infused the interventionist doctrines that the army began to develop in the
mid-to-late 1950s.
In recent years the Indonesian Army has distanced itself from corporatist / functional forms of
interest representation and has largely retreated from an active involvement in politics.
Nevertheless, the thesis identifies a continuing adherence within the Army leadership to
Nasution&#65533;s system of territorial commands and concepts of 'people&#65533;s resistance' that cannot
readily be reconciled with democratic processes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil-military relations</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Organism (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Generals</field><field name="subject">Armed Forces</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060227.095349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of adhesively bonded steel sheets using ultrasonic techniques</field><field name="creator">Tavrou, Chrysostomos Kyriacou</field><field name="description">Adhesives have presently reached a stage where they have become part of everyday
life both in a professional sense as well as for household applications. They offer
advantages that in many respects surpass other joining processes such as bonding
of large areas, joining a wide range and dissimilar materials; and without the need for
special tooling or operator training, that is often required by many other joining
processes. They are of course not a panacea to all fastening applications, but they
can easily be described as the most versatile and most widely used joining method at
present.
Engineering applications have also benefited from the advantages offered by
adhesives, but they are not as liberally used due to the severe consequences that
may result from bond failure. Although adhesives can demonstrate their ability to
fulfil the joining strength requirements under laboratory conditions, their application in
industry proved to be not as reliable as expected. A number of parameters that can
easily be controlled under laboratory conditions such as temperature, humidity,
surface preparation and uniform adhesive application are not as easily observed in
industry. Quality assurance during manufacturing can achieve excellent results;
however even in these cases the probability of having adhesive bond defects is still
present. Therefore, there is a need for post process inspection of adhesive bonds
where risk levels require higher reliability than what is offered though process quality
control.
Adhesive bond inspection is a well researched area with respectable outcomes. Non
destructive inspection techniques such as x-ray, thermal, and ultrasonic are well
utilised in the inspection of adhesive bonds. However, despite all the effort in this
area for more than forty years, there is still no singular technique that can achieve the
confidence level required in some engineering applications. Therefore, the need for
continuing research in the area of non-destructive evaluation of adhesive bonds is as
necessary today as it&#65533;s ever been. The research presented in this thesis, continues
in the same endeavour as many other researchers; that of achieving the ultimate
technique in adhesive bond inspection, capable of reaching the confidence level
required for all engineering applications.

The research in the thesis commenced with coverage of adhesives used for
engineering applications and a study of the adhesion science that was considered
necessary to enable an informed approach to the problem. Adhesive bond failure is
also analysed through a literature survey as well as experimental tests on standard
specimens. At the completion of the literature survey and preliminary tests, a
decision was taken to follow the ultrasonic path of non-destructive testing of adhesive
bonds. The reasons for this, are clearly outlined in the main body of this thesis but in
summary, the literature has shown that ultrasonic evaluation is the most widely used
technique by industry. Therefore, improvements on data analysis using existing
techniques that exploit ultrasonic inspection have the potential to reach the widest
spectrum of industrial applications.
Ultrasonic inspection equipment was sourced that was capable of achieving
experimental results to the accuracy level required in this research. A precision test
rig was designed and constructed that was subsequently calibrated using computer
based statistical techniques to ensure the validity of all results. Other ancillary
equipment, such as a portable tensile testing device were also designed and
constructed during the research as it became necessary.
Research concentrated on techniques found to be inadequately researched in this
domain. The first technique evaluated was to measure bond quality through the
stress distribution in adherent and adhesive. Computer based Finite Element
Analysis showed that the ability to detect variation in stress distribution at the
adhesion interface is capable of revealing the local bond strength. Having found that
there is no technique available at present that can measure the stress distribution at
the interface, a different direction was taken that showed potential in achieving
excellent quantitative results in the analysis of ultrasonic signals from adhesive
bonds. This technique was rigorously evaluated and the results are systematically
reported in this work.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adhesive joints</field><field name="subject">Nondestructive testing</field><field name="subject">Ultrasonic testing</field><field name="subject">Sheet-steel</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060306.085412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dopaminergic system and human spatial working memory : a behavioural, eletrophysiological and cerebral blood flow investigation</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Kathryn Anne</field><field name="description">Dopamine appears to play a critical role in regulating spatial working memory
(SWM) in non-human primates, and SWM deficits are observed in patients with
Parkinson&#65533;s disease and schizophrenia. Unfortunately, the current experimental
literature in humans is marred by inconsistent behavioural findings, and there is a void
in neuroimaging studies examining dopaminergic manipulation of SWM-related brain
activity. The present thesis used a combination of behavioural neurocognitive testing
and brain imaging to further examine dopaminergic manipulation of SWM in healthy
humans, using two pharmacological challenges: 1) acute tyrosine depletion (TPD) (to
acutely deplete tonic dopamine), and 2) D1/D2 receptor activation using the dopamine
receptor agonist pergolide (to stimulate dopamine neurotransmission) under
conditions of TPD.
The effects of TPD on behavioural performance were examined using three SWM
tasks: 1) a delayed-recognition task previously impaired by TPD (Experiment 1) and
2) two delayed-response tasks designed to vary only in response requirements
(Experiment 2). The findings demonstrated an apparent failure of TPD to impair
performance on any of the tasks. Further, the effects of TPD on SWM-related brain
activity during a SWM n-back task were examined using regional Cerebral Blood
Flow (rCBF) measured by H2
150 Positron Emission Tomography (Experiment 2), and
Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) measured by Steady State Probe
Topography (Experiment 4). TPD failed to produce discernable effects on either
neural networks (task-related rCBF) or temporal electrophysiological activity
(SSVEP) associated with the SWM n-back task. In contrast, D1/D2 receptor
stimulation under dopamine depleted conditions impaired performance on both a
SWM delayed-response task (Experiment 1) and SWM n-back task (Experiment 2),
and resulted in task-related increases in fronto-temporal SSVEP latency (suggestive of
increased inhibition) and decreases in parieto-occipital SSVEP amplitude (suggestive
of increased activation) during the early delay period of the SWM n-back task
(Experiment 4). These changes are consistent with the undisputed role of frontal and
parietal regions in n-back task performance, and with previous evidence of
dopaminergic modulation of these regions in animals and humans.
In summary, TPD did not modulate SWM behavioural performance on four different
SWM tasks with differing task demands, and failed to produce measurable changes to
either SWM-related neural networks (task-related rCBF) or cortical
electrophysiological activity (SSVEP) associated with the SWM n-back task. The
implication of these findings, when taken together with previous studies, is that the
degree of dopaminergic depletion achieved with TPD may be insufficient to
consistently and robustly modulate SWM networks in healthy humans, questioning
the utility of TPD as a probe of dopaminergic function. In addition, these findings
demonstrate the complexity of stimulating D1/D2 receptors under dopamine depleted
conditions, and highlight the critical importance of baseline dopamine levels in
influencing the effects of acute dopamine challenge on SWM performance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dopamine</field><field name="subject">Working memory</field><field name="subject">Positron emission tomography</field><field name="subject">Electrophysiology</field><field name="subject">Steady-state probe topography</field><field name="subject">Brain</field><field name="subject">Dopaminergic mechanisms</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060306.111015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electromagnetic energy regenerative vibration damping</field><field name="creator">Graves, Kynan E.</field><field name="description">This thesis documents a PhD level research program, undertaken at the Industrial
Institute Swinburne, Swinburne University of Technology between the years of 1997
and 2000. The research program investigated electromagnetic energy regenerative
vibration damping; the process of recovering energy from damped, vibrating systems.
More specifically, the main research objective was to determine the performance of
regenerative damping for the application of vehicle suspension systems. This question
emerged due to the need for continuous improvement of vehicle efficiency and the
potential benefits possible from the development of regenerative vehicle suspension. It
was noted, at the outset of this research, that previous authors had undertaken research
on particular aspects of regenerative damping systems. However in this research, the
objective was to undertake a broader investigation which would serve to provide a
deeper understanding of the key factors.
The evaluation of regenerative vibration damping performance was achieved by
developing a structured research methodology that began with analysing the overall
requirements of regenerative damping and, based on these requirements, investigated
several important design aspects of the system. The specific design aspects included an
investigation of electromagnetic machines for use as regenerative damping devices. This
analysis concentrated on determining the most promising electromagnetic device
construction based on its damping and regeneration properties. The investigation then
proceeded to develop an 'impedance-matching' regenerative interface, in order to control
the energy flows in the system. This form of device had not been previously developed
for electromagnetic vibration damping, and provided a significant advantage in
maximising energy regeneration while maintaining damping control. The results from
this analysis, when combined with the issues of integrating such a system in vehicle
suspension, were then used to estimate the overall performance of regenerative damping
for vehicle suspension systems.
The methodology and findings in this research program provided a number of
contributing elements to the field, and provided an insight into the development of
regenerative vehicle systems. The findings revealed that electromagnetic regenerative
vibration damping may be feasible for applications such as electric vehicles in which
energy efficiency is a primary concern, and may have other applications in similar
vibrating systems.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Damping (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Vibration</field><field name="subject">Automobiles</field><field name="subject">Springs and suspensions</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060307.120939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of cognitive functioning and personality traits in obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, healthy controls and sub-clinical obsessive-compulsives</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Karen</field><field name="description">Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric illness characterised by
recurrent, intrusive thoughts and repetitive, stereotyped behaviours. There is converging
evidence that OCD is associated with a specific cognitive deficit related to organising and
manipulating information in working memory. There is also evidence that OCD is associated
with certain pre-morbid personality traits. However, further research is needed to elucidate
whether these cognitive deficits and personality traits are specific to OCD or are present in other
anxiety disorders and/or individuals with sub-clinical levels of obsessive-compulsive (OC)
symptoms. In this thesis, 20 OCD patients were compared to 20 patients with panic disorder,
20 subjects with sub-clinical OC symptoms and 20 healthy control subjects on tests of working
memory and the Five-Factor Model of personality. To measure different aspects of working
memory, participants completed three delayed matching-to-sample (DMS) tasks and two
continuous performance working memory tasks (n-back tasks). The DMS tasks assessed the
ability to actively maintain different types of information in working memory (irregular objects;
geometric objects; spatial locations). The n-back tasks assessed the ability to update and
temporally order verbal and spatial stimuli in working memory. The OCD patients were less
accurate than the healthy control subjects on the memory trials of the spatial DMS task, the 3-
back trials of the spatial n-back task, and the 2-back and 3-back trials of the verbal n-back task.
The OCD patients were also less accurate than patients with panic disorder and sub-clinical OC
subjects on the verbal 3-back task. The results indicated that OCD patients were impaired on
cognitive tasks requiring the maintenance of spatial stimuli and the updating and temporal
ordering of verbal and spatial stimuli in working memory. The OCD patients were not impaired
on tasks requiring the maintenance of object information in working memory. To measure
normal personality traits, subjects completed the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PIR).
Compared to healthy controls, OCD patients reported being highly emotional and
introverted, less open to new experiences, and lacking confidence in their own abilities. The
OCD patients were similar to the panic disorder patients on most of the domains and facets of
the NEO PI-R, however, they were distinguished by their lower openness to experiencing new
activities, and being less diligent and purposeful. Compared to the sub-clinical OC subjects,
OCD patients reported being more prone to feelings of depression, more vulnerable to stress,
less likely to experience positive emotions, more humble and sincere and less able to carry
tasks through to completion. Overall, the thesis provided further evidence that OCD patients
are impaired on cognitive tasks requiring the organisation and manipulation of information in
working memory. However, it is still unclear whether this deficit arises due to capacity
constraints being exceeded in working memory systems, or some other executive dysfunction
such as excessive error monitoring. Future research, combining neuropsychological testing
with neuroimaging techniques, is required to better understand the neural mechanisms
underlying the impaired performance of OCD patients on tests of working memory. The present
thesis also found that normal personality traits &#65533; as measured by the NEO PI-R &#65533; were able to distinguish OCD patients from healthy controls, patients with panic disorder and individuals with sub-clinical levels of OC symptoms. The results have implications for sub-clinical OC research and the clinical management of OCD.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obsessive-compulsive disorder</field><field name="subject">Personality assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060307.123013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From second board to angels : an analysis of government support for new ventures, 1984-1994</field><field name="creator">Diemont-Ebes, Anja</field><field name="description">During the past decade (1984-1994), Australia experienced its worst recession since the depression of the 30's, followed by a no-growth period and an unemployment rate hovering around nine per cent.

The awareness of Commonwealth and State Governments of the need for specific policies to stimulate new ventures and support small and medium enterprises (SME's), was increased by a range of reviews which resulted in a variety of initiatives.

However, two key national initiatives, licensed Management and Investment Companies (MIC's) and the Second Board Stock Market, which aimed at making access to funds easier for new ventures, failed to provide sustained financial support to new innovative firms.

Small businesses in Australia account for some 80 per cent of all businesses and 50 per cent of employment in the private sector. While many factors contribute to the successful establishment and growth of new businesses, a key factor is the availability of and access to affordable finance.

The major objective of this study was to identify key success/failure factors in new venture creation and to review in detail the rise and fall of the Second Board Stock Market (1984-1992) - arguably one of the most significant Government initiatives during the 80's to provide access to equity funds.

A survey of Melbourne companies listed on the Second Board was to provide valuable information on the success/failure of the Second Board Stock Market and to illuminate desirable Government initiatives meeting SME's survival needs.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Stock Exchange</field><field name="subject">Venture capital</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New business enterprises</field><field name="subject">Small business</field><field name="subject">Government policy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060317.113350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'A sense of place' : the role of the building in the organisation culture of nursing homes</field><field name="creator">Buckley, Patricia Louise</field><field name="description">This study attempted to identifj and explore the role the building plays in the

incidents of corporate frauds and mismanagement reported in Australia, domestic
business organisations have been asked increasingly by Australian governments and
people to pursue sustainable business practices. As prime movers of creating wealth
and employment, business organisations have an important and legitimate role to play
in sustainable development, which is defined as a notion that meets the needs of
present without compromising the ability of future generations.
Corporate sustainability, which is a subset of the concept of sustainable development,
involves integrating financial, social, and environmental values into business policy,
planning, and decision-making requiring changes in organisational values,
perspectives, culture, structure, and performance measures. Many Australian
businesses are wary of meeting financial, social, and environmental objectives
simultaneously claiming the agenda as contradictory and almost unattainable, but the
demand for achieving corporate sustainability seems inescapable. Since Australian
businesses are facing a fierce competition in domestic market as a result of reducing
trade barriers, globalisation, and market deregulation, demanding them to contribute
more to sustainable development may appear to be unreasonable. Furthermore,
business managers are often wary of any organisational changes, as several of them
have failed in creating organisational value. As a consequence, business managers are
cautious of engaging in sustainable business practices.
In an attempt to unravel the above dilemma, this study mainly examined how to
enhance organisational value by sustainable business practices. It examined the two
dominant strategic management theories, i.e. Barriers to Entry theory and the
Resource-Based View (RBV) theory. It collected the data from 102 Australian
business organisations using a survey method. Based on its findings, this study makes a number of contributions to the theory and practice of strategic management.
Notable among them are, first, it shows that socially crafted business practices such
as knowledge management, customer relationship management, and stakeholder
management can have substantial leverage to building business competitiveness.
Second, it demonstrates that environment-oriented business practices can provide a
number of effective opportunities for increasing the height of entry barriers to new
competition. Third, this study concludes that social-oriented business activities are
almost ineffective as entry barriers to new competition. Fourth, it substantiates why
environment protection measures such as Environmental Management System (EMS)
are least contributing to business competitiveness. Finally, this study substantiates its
main claim that a business organisation can enhance its competitive advantage by
pursuing corporate sustainability principles. This study upholds the view that
business organisations have enlightened self-interest in following corporate
sustainability.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic planning</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Industrial management</field><field name="subject">Social reposibility of business</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060320.110540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A ratio-based multi-level modelling approach for signalling corporate collapse a study of Australian corporations</field><field name="creator">Hossari, Ghassan</field><field name="description">The objective of this study is to introduce a more refined methodological approach for signalling corporate collapse. The proposed methodological approach provides informed stakeholders in a corporation with a tool that would help them signal impending collapse with a higher degree of accuracy than the existing mainstream methodology. By doing so, the proposed methodological approach helps stakeholders take appropriate measures, if possible, to save their company from collapse. 

The motivation behind this study emanates from a need in the literature in relation to coming up with a new methodological approach that is superior to what is available. For example, Jones and Hensher (2004), one of the most recent studies in the field, stated that over the past three decades there has been a conspicuous absence of modelling innovation in the literature on financial distress prediction, as well as a failure to keep abreast of important methodological developments emerging in other fields of the social sciences.

Specifically, this study introduces a new ratio-based multivariate methodological approach for signalling corporate collapse, called Multi-Level Modelling (MLM). Moreover, this study demonstrated that MLM provides informed stakeholders in a corporation with a tool that would help them signal impending collapse with a higher degree of accuracy than Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA), which is the mainstream benchmark methodological approach. By doing so, MLM helps stakeholders take appropriate measures, if possible, to save their company from collapse.

The empirical results depicted the superiority of MLM over MDA. MLM generated better overall predictive power and dramatically reduced the occurrence of Type I error (classifying a collapsed company as non-collapsed). Moreover, MLM achieved those results while at the same time capturing variations in industry sectors among the data sample of companies. This is something that MDA was not capable of.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business failures</field><field name="subject">Business forecasting</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Mathematical modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060320.114422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control structures and techniques for broadband-ISDN communication systems</field><field name="creator">Pitsillides, Andreas</field><field name="description">A structured organisation of tasks, possibly hierarchical, is necessary in a BISDN network due to the complexity of the system, its large dimension and its physical distribution in space. Feedback (possibly supplemented by feedforward) control has an essential role in the effective and efficient control of BISDN. Additionally, due to the nonstationarity of the network and its complexity, a number of different (dynamic) modelling techniques are required at each level of the hierarchy. Also, to increase the efficiency of the network and allow flexibility in the control actions (by extending the control horizon) the (dynamic) tradeoff between service-rate, buffer-space, cell-delay and cell-loss must be exploited. In this thesis we take account of the above and solve three essential control problems, required for the effective control of BISDN. These solutions are suitable for both stationary and nonstationary conditions. Also, they are suitable for implementation in a decentralised coordinated form, that can form a part of a hierarchical organisation of control tasks. Thus, the control schemes aim for global solutions, yet they are not limited by the propagation delay, which can be high in comparison to the dynamics of the controlled events. 


Specifically, novel control approaches to the problems of Connection Admission Control (CAC), flow control and service-rate control are developed. We make use of adaptive feedback and adaptive feedforward control methodologies to solve the combined CAC and flow control problem. Using a novel control concept, based on only two groups of traffic (the controllable and uncontrollable group) we formulate a problem aimed at high (unity) utilisation of resources while maintaining quality of service at prescribed levels. Using certain assumptions we have proven that in the long term the regulator is stable and that it converges to zero regulation error. Bounds on operating conditions are also derived, and using simulation we show that high utilisation can be achieved as suggested by the theory, together with robustness for unforeseen traffic connections and disconnections. Even with such a high efficiency and strong properties on the quality of service provided, the only traffic descriptor required from the user is that of the peak rate of the uncontrollable traffic. 


A novel scheme for the dynamic control of service-rate is formulated, using feedback from the network queues. We use a unified dynamic fluid flow equation to describe the virtual path (VP) and hence formulate two illustrative examples for the control of service-rate (at the VP level). One is a nonlinear optimal multilevel implementation, that features a coordinated decentralised solution. The other is a single level implementation that turns out to be computationally complex. Therefore, for the single level implementation the costate equilibrium solution is also derived. For the optimal policies derived, we discuss their implementation complexity and provide implementable solutions. Their performance is evaluated using simulation. Additionally, using an ad hoc approach we have extended previous published works on the decentralised coordinated control of large scale nonlinear systems to also deal with time-delayed systems.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrated services digital networks; ISDN; broadband communication</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060321.132650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Different shades of blue individuation and depression</field><field name="creator">Peyton, Amanda</field><field name="description">Depression is uniformly identified as psychopathology by diagnostic
systems such as the DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10 and is viewed as a negatively
biased perception by cognitive theories. However, a number of psychological
and spiritual perspectives propose that the experience of depression may have
positive outcomes for some individuals in the form of psychological growth and
individuation, including theories from within the psychodynamic and humanistic
traditions. These perspectives informed the formulation of the individuation theory
of depression explored in this thesis. One empirically based perspective from
which growth is considered as a potential outcome of depression, is that of
depressive realism. This psychological stance of diminished self-deception in
depressed individuals compared with non-depressed individuals is viewed as an
opportunity for new levels of self-awareness and growth. The newly burgeoning
field of posttraumatic growth research provides another empirical model from
which the individuation theory of depression is explored in this thesis.
The current research examined the relationships among depression, selfdeception
and psychological growth in two studies. The first study used selfreport
methodology, incorporating measures of prior and current depression, selfdeception
(in the form of denial and positive illusions) and psychological growth
(in the form of self-actualisation, adversarial growth and level of egodevelopment).
The sample consisted of 132 women and 58 men (M=36 years,
SD=14.4) who were divided into previously depressed (n=51), currently
depressed (n=45), and never depressed (n=87) groups. The hypotheses
regarding the individuation theory of depressive realism were partially supported
by the enduring nature of diminished denial and a greater sense of positive personal change as sequelae of depression. Results suggest that the patterns of
negative thinking and diminished use of positive illusions that are typically found
in depressed individuals, subside after recovery from depression, but that the
diminished use of denial endures. Also as predicted, a sense of positive personal
change was significantly greater in the previously depressed group as compared
with the never depressed group, particularly in the forms of personal strength and
appreciation of life. Self-actualisation scores, however, were similar between the
two groups. Contrary to expectations, no sex differences were evident for either
the self-deception or the growth variables. Self-actualisation was significantly
higher at the highest levels of ego development compared with the lowest as
expected, yet levels of growth and self-deception were not significantly different
between the levels of ego development. Preliminary analysis of qualitative data
derived from responses to open-ended questions about change as a result of
depression, reflected predominately positive themes of adversarial growth and
benefit from the experience, especially in those of high ego-development. This
formed the basis for the focus of the second study, which was an in-depth
qualitative investigation.
The second study examined the individuation theory of depression further
via interviews with 10 women and 6 men of high ego development who had
experienced a significant depression in their lives. After describing their
experiences of depression, the respondents were asked to elaborate upon the
ways in which they felt they had been changed by their depression. Themes were
overwhelmingly positive and the most commonly reported responses were those
of a changed perception of self through a newfound inner strength, greater selfworth
and self-acceptance. Enhanced empathy and compassion were also reported, as were changed priorities and a greater appreciation of life, especially
in aspects of simplicity. Recognition of choices and acceptance of personal
responsibility for the choices made were prominent themes in some accounts,
and a number of interviewees reported the need to revise their approach to
spirituality. Although less prominent in their accounts, negative changes included
an increased sense of vulnerability and sensitivity as a mixed blessing, and the
need for ongoing management of the risk factors for depression in their lifestyle.
Some degree of cynicism about aspects of life was evident in a few respondents.
Paradoxes emerged in the interviewees&#65533; material congruent with high levels of
ego development. For example, some individuals&#65533; accounts included perceptions
of increased strength in parallel with awareness of greater degrees of
vulnerability.
Results from the two studies provide plausible evidence for the notion that
growth is not only possible, but is also a commonly experienced outcome of
depression, especially in those at higher levels of ego development. The salutary
nature of depression is discussed in relation to the theories presented and an
argument is made for a more developmentally defined and differentiated
understanding of depressive experience than cognitive definitions and
pathological labels generally afford. Suggestions are made for directions for
further research into the individuation theory of depression, including deepening
our understanding of the potential for growth as a result of depression at other
levels of ego-development.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Depressed persons</field><field name="subject">Individuation (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060412.152618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A federated approach to enterprise integration</field><field name="creator">Fernandez, George</field><field name="description">In order to remain competitive, the integration of their information systems is an imperative
for many large organisations. Applications that originally have been developed independently
are now required to interoperate to support new or different functions of the enterprise. Although
the mechanisms for application interoperation exist provided by the technology, due to
the sheer number and complexity of the running systems, integration solutions &#65533; centralised or
distributed&#65533;appropriate at the local level do not translate successfully to the whole enterprise.
Centralised integration approaches often satisfy only some of the integration requirements, they
are very expensive, and are fraught with danger since they imply an &#65533;all or nothing&#65533; approach.
Distributed approaches, on the other hand, suffer from complexity and scalability problems as
the number of system interfaces to be implemented and the number of execution-time invocations
grows with the number of component applications.
This dissertation makes a contribution to the field of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)
within the framework of distributed systems technology. Based on real-life case studies experience,
we present here a federated approach that controls the size and complexity of the
integration effort by reusing existing systems as much as possible and reducing the number of
interacting applications. Only selected local elements are exposed to the organisational milieu,
and a consistent supporting infrastructure is provided to make systems interactions possible.
Our approach provides a flexible and scalable strategy to enterprise integration, avoiding the
shortcomings of traditional approaches. We respect existing organisational structures, and
demonstrate how appropriate federation infrastructure and protocols enable the interoperation
of existing systems. The three main facets of enterprise knowledge are systematically incorporated
into the integration effort: a) by the use of domain ontologies to support data integration;
b) by the development of a methodology to include business rules; and c) by the development
of FEW, a federated workflow model to implement the business processes of the organisation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enterprise application integration (Computer systems)</field><field name="subject">Management information systems</field><field name="subject">Systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Federated systems</field><field name="subject">Enterprise computing</field><field name="subject">Enterprise architecture</field><field name="subject">Enterprise integration</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060502.113336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translation of on object role model schema into the formal language Z</field><field name="creator">Ravalli, Gilbert</field><field name="description">In the development of information systems for business, structured approaches are widely used in practice. Structured approaches provide a prescription and guidelines for how to go about the process of developing an information system, are relatively easy to learn and provide tools which are well suited to their task. However, the products of structured approaches are sometimes seen to be vague and imprecise since requirements are written using natural language or represented in the form of models which do not have a formal foundation. This vagueness or ambiguity can be the source of problems later in development of the information system. A possible solution to this is to represent requirements using formal methods since these are seen as precise and unambiguous. However, formal methods are typically only a mathematical language for representing requirements. They are often regarded as difficult to learn and use. Even though formal methods of one sort or another have been in existence for many years they are not popular and appear unlikely to become popular in the future.
One possible approach to providing the advantages of structured approaches and formal methods is to provide translation procedures from the products of structured approaches to a formal description in a suitable formal language. The work in this thesis follows this theme and is aimed at the creation of a translation procedure from an Object Role Model (ORM) schema to a Z specification. An object role model schema is the end product of a process called the Natural Language Information Analysis Method (NIAM) which is used to produce an information model for an information system. NIAM is a method which has been used successfully in industry since the mid 1970s and continues to be used today.
This thesis provides a translation procedure from ORM to Z which is less arbitrary and more comprehensive than previous conversion procedures in the literature. It establishes a systematic method for
(i) choosing suitable types and variables for a Z specification and
(ii) predicates that express all the standard constraints available in ORM modelling.
The style of representation in Z preserves ORM&#65533;s concepts in a way that aids traceability and validation. The natural language basis of ORM, namely the use of elementary facts, is preserved. Furthermore, an ORM schema differentiates between abstract concepts and the means by which these concepts are represented symbolically and this thesis provides a representation in Z that maintains the distinction between conceptual objects and their symbolic representation. Identification schemes of entity types are also translated into the Z specification but it is left as an option in the translation procedure.

Guiding and evaluating the work conducted here are a published set of criteria for the evaluation of a conceptual schema. These have helped in making decisions regarding the translation procedure and for assessing my work and that of others.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Z (Computer program language)</field><field name="subject">Object-oriented programming (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">System design</field><field name="subject">Natural Language Information Analysis Method (NIAM)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060502.130326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotional intelligence and occupational stress</field><field name="creator">Gardner, Lisa</field><field name="description">The experience of occupational stress has long been implicated in the development of
negative outcomes for the individual employee and the employing organisation. General
well-being as well as levels of job satisfaction and organisational commitment have been
identified in the literature as decreasing as a result of the experience occupational stress.
The intertwined relationship between occupational stress and emotion has also been
proposed to play a role in the stress&#65533;outcomes relationship. Although emotions are an
integral and inseparable part of everyday organisational life, they are difficult to measure
and as such have generally been ignored in the organisational literature.
Recent research has begun to focus on the role of emotions in the workplace and a
development from this approach has been to conceptually examine the relationship between
cognition and emotions. This movement has largely been attributed to new research around
the construct of Emotional Intelligence (EI). Emotional Intelligence involves behaviours
related to the experience of emotion; specifically EI involves expressing, recognising,
understanding and managing emotions. Despite the interest in workplace EI, very little
empirical research has examined the role EI may play in occupational stress. This thesis
systematically examined the relationship between EI and the occupational stress process,
including stressors, strains (health), and outcomes of stress (job satisfaction and
organisational commitment). The first study of this thesis involved the administration of a
questionnaire to 320 employees. The results of Study 1 indicate that four dimensions of EI
were particularly important in the occupational stress process: Emotional Recognition and
Expression, Understanding Emotions, Emotional Management and Emotional Control. It
was concluded that utilising EI was related to the experience of occupational stress, and to
the outcomes of occupational stress (both health and attitudes), such that employees who
reported using EI were less likely to report feelings of stress, ill-health and lowered
satisfaction and commitment.
The results of Study 1 provided a rationale for the development of an EI training program, a
program to teach employees how to utilise the dimensions of EI more effectively in the workplace and to teach them how to deal with the negative emotions that arise from the
experience of occupational stress. The prevalence of occupational stress in the Australian
workforce is increasing and as a consequence many stress management intervention
programs have surfaced in the literature, although none with emphasis on utilising emotions
more effectively. The aim of Study 2 in this thesis was to develop, implement and evaluate
an EI training program which had an emphasis on stress management.
Study 2 involved the development of a five-session group training program and a
standardised training manual. The training program was evaluated in terms of the variables
identified in Study 1 (EI, occupational stress, strains, and outcomes of stress). The sample
consisted of 79 teachers (55 with complete data sets). Baseline measures were taken at two
time intervals prior to participation in the EI training program. Participants were assessed
immediately after participation in the program and at a five-week follow-up interval.
The findings of Study 2 demonstrated the effectiveness of the EI training program in terms
of improving levels of EI, decreasing feelings of stress and strain and improving the
outcomes of stress. These changes were evident immediately after completion of the
training program and were maintained (or improved upon) at the follow-up time period.
However there were some limitations to Study 2. Specifically, the short duration of the
training program, the short follow-up time interval (of only five weeks) and the use of
secondary stress management prevention tools were each limitations of this training
program. Further research is necessary to address these limitations and to more accurately
determine the efficacy of the training program developed in this thesis.
Despite the limitations of Study 2, the EI training program implemented and evaluated in
this thesis illustrated that a training program focussed on the emotional experiences of
employees is able to successfully engage employees and assist them in dealing with the
experience of occupational stress and the consequences of stress. Furthermore, these results
demonstrate that the EI training program was successful in improving the employee&#65533;s level
of EI, providing support for the theory that EI can be learned and developed.
Overall, the development and implementation of an EI training program, in this thesis,
demonstrated that behaviours underpinning the dimensions of EI can be learned and that
training programs focussed on the emotional experiences of employees in the workplace
can be effective in improving employee well-being and in decreasing feelings of
occupational stress. The results of this thesis therefore provide support for including EI
training programs as part of stress management for employees.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emotional intelligence</field><field name="subject">Job stress</field><field name="subject">Occupational training</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060502.131940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adult attachment syle and vulnerability to depression</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the utility of Attachment Theory (Bowlby, 1969; 1973; 1980) as
a framework for understanding both the personality and cognitive processing styles
associated with depression and vulnerability to depression. In two separate but related
studies, the present investigation identified depressive personality characteristics and
depressive cognitive processing styles associated with each of the styles of adult
attachment defined by Bartholomew and Horowitz's (1991) four-category attachment
model. Using self-report data from a sample of 305 respondents (225 female; 80 male),
Study 1 explored associations among each of the adult attachment styles and sociotropic
and autonomous personality-based vulnerabilities to depression (Beck, 1983). Extending
the work of Zuroff and Fitzpatrick (1995; Study 2), associations among the attachment
styles and the specific components of the two depressive personality styles, as defined by
Robins et al. (1994), were examined. Using cued recall of autobiographical memories for a
subsample of 44 of the same respondents (35 female; 9 male), Study 2 explored
attachment style group differences in autobiographical memory retrieval, thereby
identifying specific depressive cognitive processing biases associated with each adult
attachment style. Past research has focused on the assessment of memory accessibility,
using either recall latency (Mikulincer &amp; Orbach, 1995; Mikulincer, 1998a) or memory
generality (Tasker, MacLeod &amp; Maynard, 1996) to indicate accessibility. In the present
study, both latency and generality were used as indicators of memory accessibility, and the
content of memories was also examined. In addition, use of a four-category rather than a
three-category measure of attachment style permitted distinction of cognitive biases for the
fearful-avoidant and dismissive-avoidant styles.
The present findings support a notion that the two adult attachment styles understood
to be characterised by a negative self-view, namely fearful and preoccupied attachment, are
associated with depressive vulnerability. Replicating previous findings (Carnelley,
Pietromonaco &amp; Jaffe, 1994), both the fearful and preoccupied styles were associated with
state depression and with perceptions of negative parental bonding. The fearful style in
particular was associated with perceptions of 'affectionless control' in childhood. As the
major focus of this thesis, the fearful and preoccupied attachment styles were each
associated with both personality styles and cognitive processing deficits which have
previously been linked with depression and depressive vulnerability.
In terms of personality styles (Study I), the fearful attachment style was broadly
associated with the autonomous personality style, whereas the preoccupied attachment style
was broadly associated with the sociotropic personality style, as previously demonstrated
by Zuroff and Fitzpatrick (1995; Study 2). By focusing on associations with the individual
components of the autonomous and sociotropic vulnerabilities, as defined by Robins et al.
(1994), the more specific 'depressive' personality characteristics were identified for both
these insecure attachment styles. In particular, the findings suggest that a fearful attachment
style involves both avoidant and self-critical characteristics, whereas a preoccupied
attachment style involves both dependent and self-critical characteristics.
In terms of cognitive processing deficits (Study 2), fearful individuals had difficulty
accessing autobiographical memories, indicated by delayed memory recall and reduced
memory specificity across a range of memory cues. Indeed, these individuals demonstrated
a globalised 'mnemonic interlock' typical of depressed individuals (Williams, 1996) and
their memories were predominantly negative in content. In contrast, preoccupied
individuals demonstrated a ruminative cognitive processing style, indicated by relatively
fast recall of predominantly specific and negative memories across a range of memory
cues. However, these individuals had difficulty accessing personally-relevant memories of
abandonment, arguably due to both encoding and retrieval deficits emanating from their
hypersensitivity to abandonment experiences.
Dismissive attachment was associated with the avoidant but not the self-critical aspect
of the autonomous personality style and involved a repressive cognitive processing style.
This repressive style was indicated by delayed recall of specific negative memories.
Nonetheless, unlike the fearful and preoccupied styles, dismissive attachment was not
shown to be associated with state depression, suggesting that an avoidant attachment style
does not necessarily contribute to depressive vulnerability. Instead, dismissive individuals'
use of defensive repression of negative affects and memories appears to be an effective
coping mechanism in the maintenance of a positive self-concept and a non-self-critical
approach. Furthermore, in light of self-narrative models of personality (e.g., McAdams,
1993; Bruhn, 1990; 1992; 1995; Singer &amp; Salovey, 1993), dismissive individuals' easy
access to positive memories, particularly personally-relevant memories of independence,
can be viewed as maintaining their positive self-concept.
Overall, the findings of the present thesis support the proposition that Attachment
Theory provides a framework for understanding both the personality and cognitive
processing styles associated with depression. Indeed, the findings suggest that the fearful
and preoccupied adult attachment styles can both be regarded as constituting vulnerability
factors for depression. As expected, the fearful attachment style was highlighted as
conferring greater depressive vulnerability. Thus, the findings provide further insight into
the factors involved in the onset and maintenance of depression and highlight the
importance of assessing adult attachment style during therapy for depression. Other
clinical implications, as well as directions for future research, are outlined.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Depression (Mental)</field><field name="subject">Attachment behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060503.093321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling in hierarchical games with specific reference to tennis</field><field name="creator">Barnett, Tristan J.</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates problems in hierarchical games. Mathematical models are
used in tennis to determine when players should alter their effort in a game, set
or match to optimize their available energy resources. By representing warfare,
as a hierarchical scoring system, the results obtained in tennis are used to solve
defence strategy problems. Forecasting in tennis is also considered in this thesis.
A computer program is written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), to estimate
the probabilities of players winning for a match in progress. A Bayesian
updating rule is formulated to update the initial estimates with the actual match
statistics as the match is progressing. It is shown how the whole process can
be implemented in real-time. The estimates would provide commentators and
spectators with an objective view on who is likely to win the match. Forecasting
in tennis has applications to gambling and it is demonstrated how mathematical
models can assist both punters and bookmakers. Investigation is carried out on
how the court surface affects a player&#65533;s performance. Results indicate that each
player is best suited to a particular surface, and how a player performs on a
surface is directly related to the court speed of the surfaces. Recursion formulas
and generating functions are used for the modelling techniques. Backward recursion
formulas are used to calculate conditional probabilities and mean lengths
remaining with the associated variance for points within a game, games within
a set and sets within a match. Forward recursion formulas are used to calculate
the probabilities of reaching score lines for points within a game, games within
a set and sets within a match. Generating functions are used to calculate the
parameters of distributions of the number of points, games and sets in a match.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microsoft Visual Basic for applications</field><field name="subject">Tennis -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Sports -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060504.151842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solid-stabilised foams produced using a mixed surfactant system</field><field name="creator">Rajatanavin, Pajaree</field><field name="description">Studies involving solids-stabilised foams have been limited and few have focused on the benefits of complex systems such as those involving mixtures of more than one surfactant.  Little is known about the effectiveness of using mixed surfactant systems as foam stabilisers at the bulk level.  The purpose of this project was to gain further understanding and insight into foam stability, on a bulk scale, in the absence, and in the presence, of solid colloidal particles, and for systems involving single or mixed surfactants.  

Foams were produced using sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), dodecanoic acid (DA), or a mixture of both surfactants at varying molar ratios.  The surface tension at a given concentration, the limiting surface tension (at high concentrations), the critical micelle concentration, foamability and foam stability were all significantly affected by the molar ratio of SDS to DA.  The initial pH of mixed surfactant solutions played a role in the shift of surface tension and CMC.  The higher pH values, the lower surface activity, therefore resulted in higher surface tension.  At a given pH, however, the mixed surfactant solutions with higher molar ratio of SDS to DA appeared to have lower CMC.  

The foam stabilising ability of colloidal dispersions of four hydrous metal oxides,  namely hydrous iron oxide (formed by hydrolysis of Fe(III) solutions and referred to as HFO), hydrous zinc oxide (formed by hydrolysis of Zn(II) solutions and referred to as HZO), hydrous chromium oxide (formed by hydrolysis of Cr(III) solutions and referred to as HCO), and hydrous nickel oxide (formed by hydrolysis of Ni(II) solutions and referred to as HNO) were studied at varying concentrations.  Generally foam stability increased as the solid concentration increased.  Foams stabilised by HNO were found to be the most stable.  Foams stabilised by HFO were found to be unstable regardless of the solid concentration.  It is believed that the instability of such foams is primarily due to the large aggregated size of HFO flocs.  The aggregate size of hydrous metal oxides was influenced by the concentration of NaOH used to hydrolyse the metal ion solution, and by sonication treatment immediately following solid formation.  However, the final pH of the colloidal dispersions did not significantly change the aggregate size.
Solids stabilised foams are believed to be highly dependent on the state of hydrophobicity of the solids used, and this is in turn controlled by adjustment of the pH dependent surface charge and potential.  Electrophoretic mobility is a commonly used tool to probe the potential near the surface and was used in this thesis to determine the affect of surfactant adsorption (particularly from solutions containing mixtures of SDS and DA) on surface properties of the solids.  The electrophoretic mobility of all hydrous metal oxide aggregates decreased as the concentration of SDS/DA increased.  Specific adsorption was evident in all cases and resulted in charge reversal for most cases.  Electrophoretic mobility data for surfactant adsorption, as a function of total surfactant concentration, was consistent with a three-stage model of surfactant adsorption involving (1) electrostatic adsorption, (2) cooperative adsorption and (3) surface saturation.  The influence of surfactant adsorption on electrophoretic mobility was found to be consistent with models requiring the stabilising solids to be in a controlled state of flocculation, where the zeta potential (as probed by electrophoretic mobility) must be sufficiently high to prevent total flocculation of the solid and thus collapse of the foam, but sufficiently low that the solids have some degree of hydrophobicity such that they prefer to be only partially wetted (and thus reside at the air/water interface).
 

The total percentage adsorption of SDS/DA surfactant mixtures on both hydrous iron oxide and hydrous nickel oxide was found to be independent of time.  However, the proportion of adsorption due to SDS and DA was dependent on time.  Moreover, the initial and final ratio of SDS to DA adsorption did not reflect their ratio in solution.  SDS adsorbed, initially, to a greater extent that would be predicted from its solution concentration, but this trend was reversed after a period of time.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Factory and trade waste -- Purification</field><field name="subject">Foam</field><field name="subject">Surface active agents -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Adsorption</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060504.153041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agent-based ontology management towards interoperability</field><field name="creator">Li, Li</field><field name="description">Ontologies are widely used as data representations for knowledge bases and marking
up data on the emerging Semantic Web. Hence, techniques for managing ontol-
ogy come to the centre of any practical and general solution of knowledge-based
systems.
Challenges arise when we look a step further in order to achieve flexibility and
scalability of the ontology management. Previous works in ontology management,
primarily for ontology mapping, ontology integration and ontology evolution, have
exploited only one form or another of ontology management in restrictive settings.
However, a distributed and heterogeneous environment makes it necessary for re-
searchers in this field to consider ontology interoperability in order to achieve the
vision of the Semantic Web. Several challenges arise when we set our goal to
achieve ontology interoperability on the Web. The first one is to decide which soft-
ware engineering paradigm to employ. The issue of such a paradigm is the core of
ontology management when dynamic property is involved. It should make it easy
to model complex systems and significantly improve current practice in software
engineering. Moreover, it allows the extension of the range of applications that can
feasibly be tackled. The second challenge is to exploit frameworks based on the pro-
posed paradigm. Such a framework should make possible flexibility, interactivity,
reusability and reliability for systems which are built on it. The third challenge is
to investigate suitable mechanisms to cope with ontology mapping, integration and
evolution based on the framework. It is known that predefined rules or hypotheses
may not apply given that the environment hosting an ontology is changing over
time.

Fortunately, agents are being advocated as a next generation model for en-
gineering complex and distributed systems. Also some researchers in this field
have given a qualitative analysis to provide a justification for precisely why the
agent-based approach is well suited to engineer complex software systems. From
a multi-agent perspective, agent technology fits well in developing applications in
uncontrolled and distributed environments which require substantial support for
change. Agents in multi-agent systems (MAS) are autonomous and can engage in
interactions which are essential for any ongoing agents&#65533; actions. A MAS approach
is thus regarded as an intuitive and suitable way of modelling dynamic systems.
Following the above discussion, an agent-based framework for managing ontology
in a dynamic environment is developed. The framework has several key characteris-
tics such as flexibility and extensibility that differentiate this research from others.
Three important issues of the ontology management are also investigated. It is be-
lieved that inter-ontology processes like ontology mapping with logical semantics
are foundations of ontology-based applications. Hence, firstly, ontology mapping
is discussed. Several types of semantic relations are proposed. Following these,
the mapping mechanisms are developed. Secondly, based on the previous mapping
results, ontology integration is developed to provide abstract views for participating
organisations in the presence of a variety of ontologies. Thirdly, as an ontology is
subject to evolution in its life cycle, there must be some kind of mechanisms to
reflect their changes in corresponding interrelated ontologies. Ontology refinement
is investigated to take ontology evolution into consideration. Process algebra is
employed to catch and model information exchanges between ontologies. Agent
negotiation strategy is applied to guide corresponding ontologies to react properly.
A prototype is built to demonstrate the above design and functionalities. It is
applied to ontologies dealing with the subject of beer (type). This prototype con-
sists of four major types of agents, ranging from user agent, interface agent,
ontology agent, and functionary agent. Evaluations such as query, consistency
checking are conducted on the prototype. This shows that the framework is not
only flexible but also completely workable. All agents derived from the framework
exhibit their behaviours appropriately as expected.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Semantic web</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060504.153959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intersubjectivity and large groups a systems psychodynamic perspective</field><field name="creator">Harding, Wendy Robyn</field><field name="description">This thesis argues the importance of the quality of relation between the individual and the large group in work organisations. The main thrust of this argument is that where relations between the individual and the large organisation are mutually recognising both the individual and the large organisation benefit. 

The research explores three unstructured large groups through experiences of participants. The conceptual framework underpinning the research follows system psychodynamic traditions. These traditions support in depth exploration of both conscious and unconscious aspects of group life. 

A multi case study design allows analysis of each of the case studies of the large groups, first separately and then together. Each of the single case analyses reveals patterns of interaction that are thought about as defense against the difficulties of being in the particular large group. The findings of the single case studies then become data for the multicase analysis. In the multicase analysis intersubjective theory is introduced. These theories, along with traditional system psychodynamic theories, allow opportunity to deeply consider the way in which individuals relate to the large group, and the impact of this relation on the formation and development of the large group. 

The multicase analysis shows the difficulties group members had in asserting themselves and finding recognition in each of the large groups. The analysis also   shows that despite these problems members continued to seek a recognising relation to the large group. This type of recognition, &#65533;large group recognition&#65533;, is distinguished from recognition found within interpersonal relations. 

The multicase data suggests group members found large group recognition through direct and representative relations to the formal authorities and through subgroup competition. However, this recognition appeared to be characterised by dynamics of domination and submission rather than by mutual recognition. In intersubjective terms this is the dialectic of the master and slave. Recognition garnered through a master slave dynamic is understood to be compromised and deplete of the self-affirming qualities of mutuality. Consequently, where large group culture and structure are characterised by, and perpetuate master slave dynamics, the large group and the individual do not function optimally. This is proposed as the circumstance in the large groups of this study. Specifically, it is argued that the large size of the groups, along with tendencies towards patriarchal structure and culture, were instrumental in fostering master slave dynamics in each of the groups.

To conclude the thesis the research findings are considered with respect to large work organisations. This discussion explores the value of organisational contexts informed by mutuality, most particularly as organisations face the challenges of the post industrial era.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Work</field><field name="subject">Work environment</field><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="subject">Organisational behaviour</field><field name="subject">Psychology (Industrial)</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060505.151504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory case study of internal service quality in a telecommunications organisation a frontline employee perspective</field><field name="creator">Krios, Kon</field><field name="description">The following dissertation is an exploratory case study of a telecommunications organisation&#65533;s call
centres. Specifically, it was focused on investigating internal service quality issues that related to
the frontline employee role, a clearly underdeveloped area of study in services marketing literature.
The study involved firstly identifying the internal services delivered to frontline employees, and
then gaining their perceptions of the service quality dimensions most important to them within each
workplace situation. This in turn provided an indication of how internal services could be
customised and classified to best meet frontline employees&#65533; work requirements and therefore
increase their job effectiveness. In addition, the case study explored frontline employees&#65533; overall
perceptions of the quality of delivery of each internal service, which helped provide further insights
into their work needs. Frontline employees&#65533; perceptions were also sought regarding the importance
of each internal service to them, in terms of increasing their ability to generate revenue for the
organisation. This provided an indication of how different internal services impacted upon their
exchanges with external customers.
Twelve internal services and seven internal service quality dimensions were identified through
conducting extensive observation and undertaking interviews with frontline employees at one of the
call centres. The information obtained helped inform a web-based online survey that was
implemented to address the three focal research questions. The online survey was successfully
completed by 301 frontline employees.
The results showed that while all twelve internal services shared some similarities in their demand
characteristics, some groups of internal services were distinctly different to others. As a result of
these similarities and differences, the internal services were classified into four categories: trainingintensive
internal services; communication-based internal services; real-time-based internal
services; and, performance-related internal services.
While the four classification categories can provide a solid guide for internal suppliers about how to
approach groups of internal services, it was apparent that frontline employees had unique needs in
each of the twelve internal services. This emphasised the need for the classification scheme to be
used only as a guide, whereby internal suppliers should methodically identify all the quality
attributes most important to frontline employees in each individual internal service situation.

The results also showed that frontline employees perceived some internal services as more
important than others, in terms of increasing their ability to generate revenue for the organisation.
As a result, it was suggested that internal services could also be classified according to their
&#65533;importance&#65533; levels, as this could help managers in their allocation of organisational resources.
The case study provided a valuable insight into frontline employees&#65533; needs, and other internal
service quality issues related to their roles. Because the results and conclusions were specific to a
particular case, it is essential that this area of research be extended further in future.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Telecommunication</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="subject">Customer services</field><field name="subject">Telemarketing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060505.152642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nexus between organisational culture and IT implementation in Vietnamese organisations : a doctoral thesis</field><field name="creator">Vo, Hong Nga</field><field name="description">In Vietnam, together with the renovation program known as Doi moi, promulgation of resolution 49/CP in 1993 and subsequently of directive 58 CT/TW in 2000 provided the incentive and resolve to use Information Technology (IT) as a driver of economic development and social advancement. Thus, IT was designated a national strategic priority. However, despite the Government&#65533;s efforts to implement IT, uptake and use of IT in organisations have been embryonic. Existing studies implied IT implementation in Vietnamese organisations to have been influenced in part by organisational culture factors traceable to the national culture. In light of these findings, the present study focuses on the relationships between organisational culture and IT implementation in Vietnamese organisations. Nine objectives were set for the study. The related research questions were focused on identifying the most common features of organisational culture in Vietnam, how respondents&#65533; and organisational characteristics were associated with organisational culture, the general level of IT implementation success in organisations, how respondents&#65533; and organisational characteristics were associated with IT implementation, and the nature of the relationship between a Vietnamese organisation&#65533;s culture and effectiveness of its IT implementation. In pursuing quantitative research methodology, a questionnaire was developed and subjected to a focus group scrutiny at the preliminary stage and then again prior to implementation to confirm the questionnaire&#65533;s suitability and applicability. Data, from 328 returned questionnaires, and the findings of the subsequent analyses were validated via semi-structured interviews and a panel of experts. To address the research questions, the data were subjected to a battery of statistical analysis tools, including descriptive, correlation, association, analyses of variance and factor analysis. The findings were then interpreted and the panel of experts used to confirm and better understand the findings and to offer extra insights. The majority of the organisations surveyed were characterised by the 'Elephant' organisational culture (OC) style that had elements of order, uniformity, rules and regulations and emphasis on stability. Most of these organisations were state-owned enterprises located in northern Vietnam. In number, these were followed by the &#65533;Tiger&#65533; OC organisations, comprising mainly private and foreign-owned organisations, especially those located in Ho Chi Minh City. These &#65533;Tiger&#65533; organisations stressed their operational efficiency, and externally positioned themselves toward winning competitive advantage and achieving market superiority. &#65533;Rabbit&#65533; characteristics, such as flexibility, creativity and innovation did not surface often within Vietnamese organisations. Most organisations surveyed claimed to enjoy a rather high level of IT implementation benefits, especially those relating to internal-focused aspects such as &#65533;Faster response time&#65533;, &#65533;Better communication &amp; networking&#65533;, and &#65533;Higher quality of performance&#65533;. Finance related benefits of IT implementation were at the lowest level. Private and foreign-owned organisations had the highest level of both IT investment payoff and IT implementation benefits while state-owned organisations had the lowest on both measures. State-owned organisations also reported the most problems with IT implementation the most frequently, while foreign-owned organisations least often faced such problems. Exploration of the association between OC and IT implementation showed that 'Elephants&#65533; were significantly associated with lower levels of successful IT implementation, while &#65533;Tiger&#65533; organisations followed by &#65533;Rabbit&#65533; were significantly associated with higher levels of success. &#65533;Production-oriented&#65533; organisations indicated higher levels of IT investment payoff than &#65533;People-oriented&#65533; ones. Organisations with &#65533;entrepreneurial&#65533; characterisation were found to have high levels of IT implementation success. In light of the findings and their implications, recommendations were made for government, industry, business and research organisations. The recommendations are designed to foster improved uptake and use of IT in Vietnamese organisations through the process of 'Organisational Doi moi' (organisational renewal) as well as to enlarge the research base on socio-cultural aspects of IT to buttress such efforts.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">organisational culture</field><field name="subject">IT implementation</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">organisational change</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060605.150040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autonomous in-flight path planning to replace pure collision avoidance for free flight aircraft using automatic depedent surveillance broadcast</field><field name="creator">Holdsworth, Robert</field><field name="description">By the year 2020 the number of aircraft will have
increased substantially and will be in &#65533;Free Flight&#65533;(that
is, ATC will be devolved to the aircraft rather than
being ground based). As an aid to navigation a more
advanced form of collision avoidance will be required.
This thesis proposes a method of collision avoidance
planning using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast
(ADS-B) and Dynamic Programming (DP). It in essence
enables Air Traffic Control (ATC) from within the cockpit
for remote or uncontrolled airspace and is a step toward
Free Flight. Free Flight requires quite different
strategies than those used in the present collision
avoidance schemes.
This thesis reviews the approaches to collision
avoidance used in the Air traffic navigation and to
similar problems in other industries. In particular it
considers the extended problem of collision avoidance
within the framework of path planning. This is a key
departure from the approach to aircraft collision
avoidance used in the industry to date. Path planning
reflects the real goal of an aircraft, which is to reach
a particular destination efficiently and safely. Dynamic
Programming is one solution method used in other
industries for the problem of path planning to avoid
collisions with fixed obstacles. The solution proposed herein for the Aircraft case uses Dynamic Programming
applied to the moving obstacle case.
The problem is first simplified by assuming fixed
(static) obstacles for the cost minimisation algorithms.
These fixed obstacles are then moved with time and the
minimisation process is repeated at each time increment.
Although this method works well in most cases, situations
can be constructed where this method fails, allowing a
collision. A modified approach is then used, whereby the
movement of obstacles is included more explicitly (by
modifying the shapes of the obstacles to represent
motion) in the cost minimisation algorithm and a safe
manoeuvre distance for each aircraft is used (by
expanding the object size), to allow space for aircraft
to execute safe evasive manoeuvres in difficult cases.
This modification allows solutions which are complete
(with no known cases of failure &#65533; collision situations)
and should be considered as an important extension to the
current Aircraft and Collision Avoidance System (ACAS).
The testing of these solutions is focussed on the
most difficult cases, and includes aircraft movement in
&#65533;real space&#65533; (that is simulations using real aircraft
dynamics together with dynamic programming algorithms
running in discrete time steps).</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Airplanes</field><field name="subject">Collision avoidance</field><field name="subject">Navigation (Aeronautics)</field><field name="subject">Airlines</field><field name="subject">Technological innovations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060608.141036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three-body effects on the phase behaviour of noble gases from molecular simulation</field><field name="creator">Wang, Liping</field><field name="description">In this work the phase behaviour of noble gases is studied comprehensively by different molecular simulation methods using different intermolecular potentials. The aim is to investigate three-body effects on the phase behaviour of noble gases. A true two-body potential model (Barker-Fisher-Watts potential) and the three-body potential model (Axilrod-Teller term) have been used.
The results obtained from the two-body BFW potential with the three-body Axilrod-Teller potential included for the vapour-liquid and solid-liquid phase equilibrium properties of pure noble gases are compared with the calculations using the Lennard-Jones potential with different suggested parameter values. The results have been compared with experimental data and the best parameter values for simulating the thermodynamic properties of noble gases are found.
Three-body effects on the phase behaviour of noble gases are reported for a large range of density, temperature and pressure. Simple relationships have been found between two-body and three-body potential energies for pure fluids and solids. Three-body effects on the vapour-liquid phase equilibrium properties of argon, krypton, xenon and argon-krypton systems are studied by the Gibbs-Duhem integration Monte Carlo method. Three-body effects on the solid-liquid phase equilibrium properties of argon, krypton and xenon are investigated by non-equilibrium and equilibrium molecular dynamics techniques. All the calculations have been compared with experimental data, which show that three-body interactions play an important role in the overall interatomic interactions of noble gases.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Molecular dynamics</field><field name="subject">Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Gases (Rare)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060608.145124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical study of biological problems in a predator-prey system</field><field name="creator">Chakraborty, Aspriha</field><field name="description">The logistic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey equations with diffusion based on
Luckinbill's experiment with Didinium nasutum as predator and Paramecium aurelia as prey, have been solved numerically along with a third equation to include
prey taxis in the system. The effect of taxis on the dynamics of the population
has been examined under three different non-uniform initial conditions and four
different response functions of predators. The four response functions are Holling
Type 2 Response, Beddington Type Response or Holling Type 3 Response, a response function involving predator interference and a modified sigmoid response
function. The operator splitting method and forward difference Euler scheme have
been used to solve the differential equations. The stability of the solutions has been
established for each model using Routh - Hurwitz conditions, variational matrix.
This has been further verified through numerical simulations.
The numerical solutions have been obtained both with and without prey-taxis
coefficient. The effect of bifurcation value of prey-taxis coe&#65533;cient on the numerical
solution has been examined. It has been observed that as the value of the taxis
coefficient is increased significantly from the bifurcation value chaotic dynamics
develops for each model. The introduction of diffusion in predator velocity in the
system restores it back to normal periodic behaviour.
A brief study of coexistence of low population densities both with and without

An experiment was conducted in which a Web site, designed with three controlled levels

The measures used represent facets of the Categorical-Motivation model of aesthetics,
plus others directly related to the performance of Web sites. The results of the experiment
indicate that the drivers of site evaluation were primarily exploratory variables that
represent 'novelty', 'interest' and 'fun'. This supports the argument that an important
question to consider when designing a Web site is not merely 'can the site's audience use
the Web site?', but also 'does the site's audience want to use the Web site?' Visual, audio
and interactive appeal are, as the findings show, very important design considerations.

Mathematical models are used to evaluate the performance of individuals, teams, and the competition rules under which they compete.  The thesis comprises a collection of papers on applications of modelling to Australian rules football, soccer and cricket.  Using variations of the model wij = ui  + hi - uj  + eij  where wij  is the home team winning margin when home team i plays away team j, ui  is a team rating, hi is an individual ground effect and eij  is random error, the evaluation of team home ground advantage effect (HA) is studied in detail.  Data from the Australian Football League and English Association Football for 1980 to 1995 are investigated.  The necessity of individual team HAs is demonstrated.  The usual methods of calculating HA for competitions is shown to be inappropriate for individual teams.  The existence of a spurious HA when home and away performances are compared is discussed.  For a balanced competition, fitting the above model by least squares is equivalent to a simple calculator method using only data from the final ladder.  A method of calculating HA by pairing matches is demonstrated.  Tables of HA and paired HA in terms of points/game for each year are given.  The resultant HAs for both Australian rules football and soccer are analysed.  Clearly there is an isolation effect, where teams that are isolated geographically have large HAs.  For English soccer, the paired HA is shown to be linearly related to the distance between club grounds.  As an application of these methods, the development and implementation of a computer tipping program used to forecast Australian rules football by rating teams is described.  The need for ground effects for each team and ground, and the use of heuristic methods to optimise the program is discussed.  The accuracy of the prediction model and its implementation by publication in the media is discussed.  International comparisons show prediction methods are limited by the data.  Methods for evaluating the fairness of the League draw and the finals systems are given.  The thesis also investigates the use of dynamic programming to optimise tactics in football and cricket.  The thesis develops tables giving the optimal run rate and the expected score or probability of winning at any stage of a one-day cricket innings.  They show a common strategy in one-day cricket to be non-optimal, and a heuristic is developed that is near optimal under a range of parameter variations.  A range of dynamic programming models are presented, allowing for batsmen of different abilities and various objective functions.  Their application to performance modelling are shown by developing a radically different performance measure for one day cricket, and applying it to a one-day series.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sports</field><field name="subject">Peformance</field><field name="subject">Australian football</field><field name="subject">Cricket</field><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060710.114216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The growth lobby and its absence the relationship between the property development and housing industries and immigration policy in Australia and France</field><field name="creator">Newman, Sheila</field><field name="description">This thesis compares population policy and demographic outcomes in France and Australia from 1945 taking into consideration projections to 2050. These features are analysed using a theoretical approach derived from James Q. Wilson and Gary Freeman, flagging focused benefits/costs and diffuse benefits/costs of population growth, including growth fueled by immigration. This analysis is framed by the New Ecological Paradigm developed by Dunlap and Catton.
The oil shock of 1973 is identified as a major turning point where French and Australian policy directions and demographic trends diverge, notably on immigration.
It is established that in both countries there was a will for population stabilisation and energy conservation, which succeeded in France. In Australia, however, a strong, organised growth lobby over-rode this Malthusian tendency. A major force for growth lay in the speculative property development and housing industries. The specific qualities of the Australian land development planning and housing system facilitated land speculation. Speculative opportunity and profits were increased by population growth and, with decreasing fertility rates, the industries concerned relied increasingly on high immigration rates. In France, to the contrary, the land development planning and housing industries had no similar dependency on immigration and, since the oil shock, have adapted to a declining population growth rate.
The author concludes that France has a relatively Malthusian economy and that Australia has a relatively Cornucopian one. These observations may be extrapolated respectively to non-English speaking Western European States and to English Speaking Settler States.
Speculative benefits from population growth/immigration are illustrated by demonstrating a relationship between ratcheting property price inflation in high overseas immigration cities in Australia and the near absence of this inflation in low growth areas. In contrast this ratcheting effect is absent in France and French cities where population growth and immigration have little influence on the property market.
The research suggests that speculative benefits of high population growth have been magnified by globalisation of the property market and that these rising stakes are likely to increase the difficulty of population stabilisation and energy conservation under the Australian land development and planning system.

The government statistics highlight a frightening pattern of sexual abuse in Australia, with the trend implicating that sexual assault is on the rise and that children are the predominant victims (ABS, 2003b). Specifically, 17,850 reports of sexual assault were recorded in 2002, a 6% increase since 2001. Further to this, there is still no universal agreement as to the extent to which treatment effectively reduces sexual recidivism. Therefore, there is an urgent need for research into this problem behaviour. Research examining the causes of sexual offending has examined a biological hypothesis that sex offenders have functional brain impairment. However, the results of neuropsychological
assessments of various sex offender populations are inconsistent and inconclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the brain function of males convicted and incarcerated for sexual offences against children using neuropsychological assessment. Specifically, it was hypothesised that the sex offenders would show functional impairment in their frontal and temporal lobes. A battery of neuropsychological tests was compiled to assess the functions of these regions including four WAIS-Ill subtests (Arithmetic, Vocabulary, Block Design and Picture Arrangement), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Rey Complex Figure (RCF), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the FAS Test. These tests were administered to 25
incarcerated male sex offenders, 25 incarcerated male non-sex offenders and 25 men with no criminal history. Although attempts were made to match these groups on age, level of education and level of intelligence, statistical analyses revealed that there were significant differences between the groups on these variables. These differences were statistically controlled using analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) and factorial analyses of variance (ANOVA).
The results indicated that the sex offenders performed significantly worse than the controls on all neuropsychological tests. However, statistically significant differences were only found between the sex offenders and control group on the immediate recall trials of the RAVLT and RCF. These observed differences did not change when age, level of education and level of intelligence were statistically controlled. It was concluded that there is insufficient evidence from this study to support the hypothesis that sex offenders have functional impairment in their frontal and temporal lobes. However, given the relevance of potential brain impairment to both the biological and social-cognitive perspectives of sexual offending, future research in this field is warranted.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sex offenders</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Criminal behavior (Prediction of)</field><field name="subject">Child sexual abuse</field><field name="subject">Personality assessment</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychological tests</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060711.090050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Instrumentation for high spatial resolution of steady state visual evoked potentials</field><field name="creator">Simpson, David Gordon Giles</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on several new and innovative instrumentation developments to
solve some of the problems of brain activity monitoring, particularly SSVEP (Steady
State Visual Evoked Potentials) studies. SSVEP systems generate suitable stimuli and
record the resulting brain biopotentials from scalp electrodes.
The instrumentation is configured as a 'Neuropsychiatric Workstation', supporting up to
136 scalp electrodes. Operating in the SSVEP mode, the Neuropsychiatric Workstation
reported here significantly improves upon the previously reported spatial resolution and
accuracy of maps related to the generated stimuli. These maps allows insights to be
gained into the cognitive workings of the brain.
A significant component of the work reported here covers the development of the multielectrode
EEG measurement modules and the associated techniques for minimising
interference and cross-talk. The techniques for synchronising recordings from all
electrodes with the stimulus, interfacing to a host computer and real-time storage of the
very large amounts of data generated to hard disk, are all reported.
The SSVEP paradigm uses a sinusoidal-modulated visual stimuli. A novel linearised
LED (light emitting diode) head-up display was developed, in addition to more
conventional stimuli, such as the alternating checker-board display, all with sinusoidal
modulation capability over a range of frequencies.
The Neuropsychiatric Workstation described in thesis has been replicated several times

The research reported herein examines the many factors which emerge when considering the name of interaction at the user interface. Temporal 
Aspects of Usability (TAU) is presented as a multivariate construct. It is neither a 
property that exists 'in the head alone' not is it an aspect of the system but rather 
an emergent property arising from task based interactions. 
From a theoretical perspective, it is argued that the inclusion of temporal considerations to the task model more fully specifies 'Usability' as a design construct. A model of TAU is evolved and validated utilizing situated interviews with designers. This resulted in an Enhanced model of TAU. A method for developing temporally informed task models, KAT-LITTER (Leveraging Interactions Through Effective Responses), provides temporal design heuristics as the confluence of, KAT (Knowledge Analysis of Task) a task analysis method, and the enhanced TAU model. As a method, KAT-LITTER is device independent, data centered, domain specific and necessarily independent of existing implementations. A process evaluation of KAT-LITTER showed that it influenced the design process in two significant ways: firstly, designers using KAT-LITTER spent more time reasoning about temporal issues than designers using KAT alone, and secondly these same designers considered a broader spectrum of temporal issues. 
The development of TAU, its accompanying method, KAT-LITTER, complete with a notational system for analysis represent a significant step forward.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">end-user computing</field><field name="subject">interactive computer systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060712.121947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of the quality of childhood sports participation experiences on adult motivation to be physically active</field><field name="creator">Abbott, Jo-Anne</field><field name="description">As efforts to promote greater participation in physical activity among adults
have focussed on targeting childhood patterns of physical activity, it is important to
evaluate the assumed relationship between childhood and adulthood patterns of
physical activity. In the studies in this thesis an examination was made of whether
adult motivation to engage in physical activity is influenced by the perceived quality
of experiences with sports participation in childhood and adolescence.
In a pilot study, a measure of perceived quality of childhood and adolescent
sports participation experiences was developed. Young adults were asked by
questionnaire to rate their childhood and adolescent sports participation experiences
on a variety of items. From these responses, measures of the quality of childhood and
adolescent sports participation experiences were validated with confirmatory factor
analyses.
In the main study, the measure of adolescent sports participation experiences
was incorporated into a second questionnaire along with other measures of adult
motivation towards, and participation in, physical activity. The theoretical framework
of Personal Investment Theory (PIT, Maehr &amp; Braskamp, 1986) guided the design of
this study. PIT proposes that individuals are motivated to participate in physical
activity based on what they hope to gain from participation, their beliefs about
themselves and their perceptions of opportunities for participation. This motivation
is, in turn, influenced by a number of other personal and situational factors, such as
prior personal experiences with sports participation.
The results of correlation and structural equation modelling analyses
suggested that the direct influence of the perceived quality of adolescent sports
participation experiences on the level of adult involvement in physical activity is
relatively weak. Structural equation modelling analyses indicated that this
relationship is mediated by some of these other motivational variables in PIT. These
were individuals. perceptions of their physical competence and personal control over
their physical activity behaviour, as well as the tendency to set physical activity goals
and to seek intrinsic motives for physical activity, such as skill improvement or
enjoyment. Although the quality of sports participation experiences also influenced
perceptions about the impact of potential barriers on activity in adulthood, such
perceptions did not relate to the actual level of activity of these adults.

The perceived quality of adolescent sports participation experiences also
influenced the type of physical activity engaged in as an adult, with more negative
memories of sports participation being associated with taking part in non-sport-related
physical activities in adulthood. In conclusion, application of PIT, along with the use
of structural equation modelling, provided valuable insight into how the quality of
adolescent sports participation experiences influences adult physical activity
behaviour.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sports</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060712.140042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of a hybrid magnetic and piezoelectric polymer microactuator</field><field name="creator">Fu, Yao</field><field name="description">Microsensors and microactuators are considered to be the most crucial elements
of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and devices. There has been growing interest
in the development of new microactuator technologies with an increasing requirement
for low cost microswitch arrays providing large air gap and large force at the
same time. In particular, large air gap/large force microactuators are essential for high
voltage switching in automobile electronics, test equipment switchboards and in network
remote reconfiguration. The necessity to reduce the size of actuators and at the
same time increase the force and the air gap has placed severe constraints on the suitability
of current microactuator technology for various applications. This has led to the
development of new actuator technologies based on novel materials or modifying existing
systems. As an effort in this direction, this thesis presents the details of the work on
the design, fabrication and testing of a new hybrid microactuator, combining electromagnetic
and piezoelectric actuation mechanisms.
The design and fabrication of electromagnetic actuators using planar coils and a
soft magnetic core has long been established. However, in many instances these designs
are constrained by difficulties in the fabrication of the multi layer planar coils, which is
tedious, often resulting in a low yield. Hence device performance is limited by the
maximum coil currents and thereby the maximum force able to be generated. In order to
overcome these problems, a hybrid actuator combining the electromagnetic system
along side of a piezoelectric actuation is proposed. This has been demonstrated to assist
in enhancing the total force and consequently achieving larger actuator displacements.
In this research a hybrid microactuator with a footprint of 10 mm2 was designed, fabricated
and tested. It can generate 330 &#50080;force and cover 100 &#52064;air gap as a microswitch.
Piezoelectric actuation has been used for many applications, due to its high precision
and speed. In these applications, piezo-ceramic materials, such as PZT and ZnO
were commonly used because they exhibit large piezoelectric coefficients. However,
there are also some difficulties associated with their use. Piezoelectric ceramic materials
are usually brittle, and have a relatively large Young?s modulus, thus limiting the
achievable strain. Furthermore, the deposition technologies required for preparing
thin/thick films of these ceramic materials need extensive optimization. Patterning these
films into required structures is also difficult. Hence, piezoelectric polymer polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVDF) is chosen in this work in spite of the fact that these materials
have relatively lower piezoelectric coefficients. However, the low numerical Young?s
modulus values of these polymers facilitates large strain in the piezoelectric actuators.
The hybrid microactuator designed in this work comprises a piezoelectric composite
polymer cantilever with a planar electromagnetic coil structure beneath. The
composite cantilever consists of polarized piezoelectric polymer PVDF with an electroplated
permalloy layer on one side. The device includes a permalloy core at the centre
of a copper micro coil with a permanent magnetic film attached on the other side of the
silicon wafer (substrate) and is aligned axially with the permalloy core. The cantilever is
suspended from an electroplated 150 mm high nickel post.
Initially the principle was tested using hand wound electromagnetic coils with
permalloy wire as the core. The performance of such a hybrid actuator was evaluated. In
the next stage, a microactuator was fabricated using completely planar micro technologies,
such as high aspect ratio SU-8 lithography, laser micromachining, microembossing,
as well as copper and permalloy electroplating.
This micro device was designed by modelling and finite element method simulation
using ANSYS 7.1 and CoventorWare electromagnetic and piezoelectric solvers respectively.
This helped in understanding the critical aspects of the design at the same
time leading to the determination of the optimum parameters for the cantilever, micro
coils and the core. An analytical model has also been developed to validate the numerical
results obtained from finite element analysis.

primary health care experiences of gay men in Australia and assess doctors? attitudes and
training with regard to gay men and their health care. In the first study, 195 gay men were
surveyed regarding their health issues and their primary health care experiences. The
most important health concerns of gay men were stress and depression followed by
HIV/AIDS, body image disorder and other sexually transmissible infections. Including
those participants who were unsure, approximately one-half reported experiencing
homophobia and almost one?quarter reported experiencing discrimination in the
provision of health care. Despite this, respondents were generally satisfied with their
primary health care, although respondents felt that all GPs should receive additional
undergraduate medical education regarding gay men?s health. In the second study, 25
doctors (13 gay specialists and 12 non-gay specialists) were surveyed regarding their
knowledge of gay men?s health and their comfort working with gay men. Non-gay
specialist GPs were less comfortable treating gay men, reported poorer communication
and were more homophobic than their gay specialist counterparts. Further, doctors
perceived their medical education regarding gay men?s health has been inadequate.
Together, the results of the two current studies suggest that disclosure of sexuality is an
important issue for both gay men and doctors, and has the potential to impact on the
quality of health care that gay men receive. In order to improve the level of disclosure,
the pervasiveness of homophobia and discrimination in primary health care must be
reduced. Finally, the results indicate that medical education must be updated to reflect
current knowledge regarding the health issues of gay men. Failure to address these issues
will condemn gay men to continued health inequality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gays</field><field name="subject">Medical care</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Discrimination in medical care</field><field name="subject">Homophobia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060713.084655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring team performance and modelling the home advantage effect in cricket</field><field name="creator">Allsopp, Paul</field><field name="description">Cricket differs from many team sports in that it is not generally played within easily
definable constraints. Thus, it is difficult to compare and contrast team performances. By
employing a range of linear and logistic modelling techniques this thesis quantifies the
extent to which team quality effects and a range of associated factors such as home
advantage have shaped team performance in Test, ODI and domestic cricket. With regards
to the latter, the thesis established that, in all forms of cricket, a team?s scoring potential
and its capacity to win were both significantly amplified when it played at its home ground.
The thesis proposes a method to estimate a projected score for the team batting second in
ODI cricket. The method scales up the team?s actual winning scores in proportion to its
unused run scoring resources. This creates a projected victory margin when it wins with
unused run scoring resources at its disposal and provides a more realistic measure of its
relative superiority at the point of victory than the current wickets-in-hand method.
Accordingly, the thesis recommends a revised scheme for recording victories in ODI
cricket which is consistent across innings and provides a mechanism for all victories to be
compared and ranked on an equal footing.
The thesis employs linear modelling methods that account for the size of a victory in ODI
cricket and the magnitude of the first innings lead in Test and domestic cricket to compute
team ratings. The ratings are calculated independently of effects such as home advantage
and quantify overall team performance relative to the average rating. They provide a robust
measure of team quality and are not sensitive to the extraneous effects that may
disproportionately impact on team performance. As a consequence, the thesis recommends
that new methods be investigated to officially rate and rank teams in international cricket
competitions. The team ratings also form the basis of a proposed outcome prediction model
that can be instituted in Test cricket.
The thesis established that a surprising trend has emerged in Test cricket, which confirmed
that the team batting second, in general, has enjoyed a distinct winning advantage over its
opposition. Accordingly, the thesis ascertained that relative strength during the final rather
than penultimate innings significantly affected match outcomes and recommends that teams, when winning the coin toss, expose their strongest asset, whether this be batting or
bowling, in the final innings.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sports</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Cricket</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060713.122306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital technologies in Australian public schools : a narrative study of government policies</field><field name="creator">Moyle, Kathryn</field><field name="description">Policies advocating the use of digital technologies in government schools
are promoted by all public school education systems in Australia. This is
reflected in the release of political media statements, policies, plans,
budgets, digital networking rollouts, curriculum developments, and
professional development activities. Resources are being directed towards
such initiatives from within school education budgets and from
departmental and 'whole of government' initiatives, at state, territory and
federal levels. While there is considerable activity being supported by
governments, outside of these activities academic publications specifically
about these school level initiatives are limited.
This research sets out to answer the question: 'what does public schooling
mean in Australia in the 21st century given its past tradition of free,
compulsory and secular schooling, and given the present policies that are
urging the ubiquitous use of digital technologies?' The purpose of this
research is to interpret, understand and explain the policies of the public
schooling systems in Australia advocating the use of digital technologies. In
doing so, this thesis aims to contribute to the development of a stock of
Australian research specifically in the schooling sector, about the use of
digital technologies in schools. Further, this thesis aims to stimulate and add
to the conversations concerning these policies. It is argued that the use of
digital technologies in schooling has the capacity to redefine what has
previously been understood by 'public schooling'.
This thesis is the outcome of an interpretative social inquiry where narrative
theory and hegemony have provided its theoretical bases. This thesis has not
set out to merge these theories nor has it attempted to reconcile the internal
differences within them, but rather, to draw from them, and to use
approaches that are pertinent to this study. While such an approach may be
contentious and bring some inherent difficulties, the intention of the research has been to draw upon the abstract understandings afforded by
these theories and apply them to concrete, particular, yet newly emerging
educational activities. This is to provide interpretative and explanatory
perspectives to the advocated use of digital technologies in Australian
schools and systems, and, in Chapter Six, to forward a proposition for future
action.
There are several different ways in which this thesis could have been
approached and finally could have been structured. Likewise, there are
many avenues that require research but have been left without investigation
due to limitations of size, space and time. This is not to negate their
importance, but rather it is to recognise the limits of this project and to
highlight the necessity for more research to be undertaken.
Throughout the thesis distance education has been considered in conjunction
with the policies directly impinging upon 'face to face' schooling. It is
argued that with the advocated use of digital technologies as an inherent part
of public schooling, there is emerging, a convergence in these two styles of
schooling. Further it is argued that experiences from school level distance
education practitioners have the potential to offer some insights that may be
useful for those in 'face to face' schools using digital technologies. It is
intended then, that the implications from this research will have the capacity
to influence how we view centrally developed school education policies,
curriculum leadership and management as well as what is intended to
happen in the classroom.
The thesis has been arranged into three parts. The first three chapters
comprise Part One. Chapter One identifies the research space for the thesis.
This is achieved by describing the fields of research from which this thesis
draws, and introduces the theoretical bases used in the research space
identified for this thesis. Chapter Two provides the theoretical bases for the
thesis in more detail. In doing so, positivist approaches to the research are
rejected. Chapter Three describes the research methods used to interpret,understand and explain the public schooling sectors' digital technologies
policies. Together, these three chapters provide an outline of the nature of
the research undertaking, and the theories and methods used.
Part Two also has three chapters. These are structured around the temporal
concept important to narrative theory; that of the past, the present and the
future. Chapter Four looks to the past and provides an account of the history
and three traditions, it is argued, impinge upon this research project. In
particular, this chapter discusses what was intended by the phrase 'public
education' in Australia during the 19th and 20th centuries. This chapter
establishes the context for the interpretations of the policies that follow.
Chapter Five seeks to understand and explain the policy narratives of the
present, defined as the research period between 1997 and 2001. This period
of time is thought of as sitting temporally between the past history and
traditions outlined in Chapter Four and the possible scenarios for the future,
proposed in Chapter Six.
Part Three brings the thesis to its conclusion by reflecting on the central
question identified for this thesis: 'what does public schooling mean in
Australia in the 21st century, given its past tradition of free, compulsory and
secular schooling, and given the present policies that are urging the
ubiquitous use of digital technologies?'</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public schools</field><field name="subject">Government aid to education</field><field name="subject">Educational technology</field><field name="subject">Computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060721.132427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three-dimensional measurement using a single camera and target tracking</field><field name="creator">Iovenitti, Pio Gioacchino</field><field name="description">This thesis involves the development of a three-dimensional measurement system
for digitising the surface of an object. The measurement system consists of a single
camera and a four point planar target of known size. The target is hand held, and is
used to probe the surface of the object being measured. The position of the target is
tracked by the camera, and the contact point on the object is determined. The vision
based digitising technique can be used in the industrial and engineering design fields
during the product development phase.
The accuracy of measurement is an important criterion for establishing the success
of the 3-D measurement system, and the factors influencing the accuracy are
investigated. These factors include the image processing algorithm, the intrinsic
parameters of the camera, the algorithm to determine the position, and various
procedural variables. A new iterative algorithm is developed to calculate position.
This algorithm is evaluated, and its performance is compared to that of an analytic
algorithm. Simple calibration procedures are developed to determine the intrinsic
parameters, and mathematical models are constructed to justify these procedures.
The performance of the 3-D measurement system is established and compared to
that of existing digitising systems.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image processing</field><field name="subject">Computer algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060724.151747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of attitudes towardss the practice of school-based psychological services</field><field name="creator">Thielking, Monica</field><field name="description">The provision of school based psychological services in Victorian primary and
secondary schools dates back to well before the Second World War. Since then,
however, the activities that make up the role of school psychologists have changed
substantially. School psychologists' roles have become more varied than the original
psychometric focus and reflect a more systemic approach to the conceptualization of
student problems. Within Australia, school psychologists can be found servicing single
or multiple schools in the government, independent and Catholic school sectors,
fulfilling a range of functions and dealing with a diversity of student issues. However,
Australian academic research into the professional practice issues associated with the
provision of school-based psychological services is rare. Therefore, this thesis sought to
investigate a range of professional issues associated with the provision of school-based
psychological services for Victorian school psychologists working in single and
multiple schools in the government and non-government primary and secondary school
sectors. In addition to surveying Victorian school psychologists, principals and teachers
were also surveyed in order to ascertain their attitudes towards school-based
psychological services.
The sample consisted of 81 school psychologists, 21 principals and 86 teachers.
The results revealed that school psychologists participate in a variety of activities,
including a number of activities that reflect a systemic model of service delivery. They
also deal with a broad range of student issues, some of which are quite serious in nature.
However, the study also revealed a number of professional issues that were in need of
improvement. Some of these included a lack of participation in regular supervision for
school psychologists, school psychologists' dissatisfaction with some industrial and
professional conditions associated with their role and differences in attitudes between
psychologists, principals and teachers regarding the activities and responsibilities of
school psychologists. Results from the study provide plausible evidence for the need to
support school psychologists in the valuable work that they do within schools through
improved industrial conditions, appropriate professional development, and regular
supervision. Furthermore the results also reveal a need to educate and participate in
dialogue with the educational community in order to increase understanding of school
psychologists' roles and professional responsibilities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School children</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">School psychology</field><field name="subject">Mental health services</field><field name="subject">Child psycotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060814.091430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding organisation culture, leadership, conflict, and change</field><field name="creator">Drummond, Geoffrey</field><field name="description">While many studies have been carried out on organizational culture, leadership, conflict and change, mostly from an instrumentalist perspective, studies have left unanswered the question of how they are related. This thesis employs narrative theory and especially that of Ricoeur together with the social theory of Bourdieu. By considering organization culture (and its sub cultures) as being configured by multiple narratives; leaders as enacting or developing narratives; conflict as the attempt by one or more persons to impose their narratives on others as the correct interpretation of a given situation; and change as the adoption of new narratives it has been possible to impart new understandings to these concepts. Extensions are offered of the narrative theory of Ricoeur and the social theory of Bourdieu (which has strong implications for culture and the operation of power). They are then combined and applied to a narrative presentation of empirical data. This new or extended theory has powerful explanatory value with regard to the relationship between the chosen organisational aspects.

made from Recycled Aggregate (RA) Concrete. The research project was undertaken in
response to the needs expressed by the Victorian concrete recycling industry. The industry,
the scientific community conducting research into relevant disciplines, and the community
at large, represented by Victorian government agencies, are of the opinion that there is a
need to devise a higher value utilisation application for selected concrete recycling
products.
This document outlines the rationale and objectives of the research project which involves
the examination of Recycled Concrete (RC) Aggregate, the design and examination of RA
Concrete, and finally the development of an acoustic barrier made from RA Concrete.
The literature review presented in this report examines aspects of concrete recycling and
concrete technology pertaining to traditional and alternative constituent materials for
concrete production. Firstly, the importance and influence of fine and coarse aggregate on
basic properties of concrete is introduced. Secondly, an account on the use of alternative
materials in concrete technology, especially of coarse recycled aggregates and
supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) is described. Thirdly, some of the physical
and mechanical properties and how the use of RC Aggregate and SCM changes these
properties are discussed. Fourthly, a number of commonly used techniques and neutron
scattering techniques to investigate aggregate and concrete properties are introduced and
discussed. Fifthly, the porosity of aggregate and concrete including durability are
specifically discussed and testing methods are reasoned. The literature review also
discusses the use of no-fines concrete; its physical, mechanical and acoustic properties.
Finally it presents an account of the use of concrete in transportation traffic noise
attenuation devices.
This document continues with an outline of a methodology that was adopted in this
research project. It outlines experimental work aimed at examining the properties of RC Aggregate which amongst other properties includes porosity, particle size distribution,
water absorption, shape and density. It continues examining RA Concrete properties and
includes, among other properties, compressive strength, porosity and durability as well as
sound absorption of acoustic barrier. The methodology introduces standard and purposely
modified test procedures used in the examination of aggregates, concrete and acoustic
barrier. An account of various research techniques is presented, spanning from simple
visual observations to more sophisticated neutron scattering techniques. The summary of
test procedures follows a description of test specimen composition and their sizes, and a
suite of tested specimens. It also introduces statistical methods used to analyse test results.
After a detailed description of the aggregate, concrete and RA Concrete acoustic barrier,
the document outlines a summary of data generated through the experimental program of
this research project. The data on fine aggregate, on selected 14/10mm coarse RC
Aggregate, on concrete made from natural and recycled aggregate and on acoustic barrier
are presented and discussed. Test results of various physical, mechanical and acoustic
properties of aggregate, concrete and barrier are reported, analysed and discussed. The data
from observations, visual assessment and scientific experimentation of specific properties
are then crossed analysed in a search for relationships between properties of fine and coarse
aggregates and properties of concrete made from such aggregates. A cross analysis of data
on ?less-fines? RA Concrete and on the acoustic performance of barrier is examined, and
the relationship between the volume of interconnected voids in a porous part of ?less-fines?
concrete, and the sound absorption of acoustic barrier is discussed and reported.
The document then presents a synthesis of the literature review results, project aims
adopted within the experimental program and test results in the three main areas of this
research project. These areas include recycled concrete aggregate, recycled aggregate
concrete and acoustic barrier made from RA Concrete.
Finally, conclusions reached through the course of this investigation are summarised and
recommendations are proposed in relation to the RA Concrete acoustic barrier. The main
conclusion is that selected RC Aggregate can be used in the production of concrete of a compressive strength of 25MPa, if the moisture content and water absorption in the
aggregate are closely monitored, and the foreign material content is kept below 1.5%. The
author concludes that acoustic barrier made from selected RC Aggregate has unique sound
absorption characteristics that can easily be tunable by a selection of appropriate aggregate
and by specific concrete mix designs. Recommendations for further research are also
proposed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Noise barriers</field><field name="subject">Noise control</field><field name="subject">Waste products as building materials</field><field name="subject">Aggregates (Building materials)</field><field name="subject">Concrete construction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060821.154340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-precision observations of relativistic binary and millisecond pulsars</field><field name="creator">Hotan, Aidan Wade</field><field name="description">The technique of pulsar timing reveals a wealth of new information when a precision
of &#8764;1 &#956;s or better is reached, but such precision is difficult to achieve. This
thesis describes a series of very high precision timing observations that improve our
knowledge of the targeted pulsar systems. We begin by describing a newly-developed
baseband recording and coherent dedispersion system (CPSR2), along with a new
object-oriented software development environment for pulsar data processing. Data
obtained with this new instrument during a 3 year observing campaign at the Parkes
64m radio telescope are analysed in a number of novel ways.
The mean profile of PSR J1022+1001 is shown to be stable on timescales of a few
minutes, in contrast with previously published claims. We obtain a level of precision
an order of magnitude better than any previous timing of this pulsar. In addition,
we observe dramatic changes in the mean profile of the relativistic binary pulsar
J1141?6545, which broadens by &#8764;50% over the time span of our observations. This
is interpreted as evidence for secular evolution of the line of sight to the emission
cone, caused by General relativistic geodetic precession which tilts the spin axis of
the pulsar. High precision CPSR2 observations of the extraordinary double pulsar
binary system are presented and we construct calibrated, mean polarimetric profiles
for PSR J0737?3039A, in two frequency bands. These profiles provide a reference
against which future profile evolution may be detected, given that we expect geodetic
precession to alter the observed mean profile on an even shorter time scale than for
PSR J1141?6545.
The bulk of this thesis involves timing a selection of millisecond pulsars whose
physical characteristics should allow the highest precision to be obtained. We measure
several new proper motions and parallax distances. Shapiro delay is used to
constrain the inclination angles and component masses of several of the binary systems
in our source list. In addition, subtle periodic variations of the orbital parameters
of two nearby binary millisecond pulsars are detected and attributed to annual
orbital parallax, providing additional constraints on their three-dimensional orbital
geometries. Future observations of these two sources may lead to more stringent
tests of post-Keplerian gravitational theories. Finally, we use the timing residuals
of one very stable source (PSR J1909?3744) as a reference against which we time
PSR J1713+0747 with a root-mean-square precision of 133 ns, amongst the best
timing residuals ever obtained. This result is an important step in the search for
long-period gravitational waves using pulsar timing arrays.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pulsars</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060822.151026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On a wing and a prayer stories of the use of improvisation by NEIS businesses during the start-up phase</field><field name="creator">Best, Simon</field><field name="description">The focus of this study is to consider the concept of ?improvisation? as a business process used by small businesses when faced with unanticipated events. Although the business news and literature is dominated by the activities of big businesses, there is little disagreement among researchers and business commentators about the role that small businesses plays in contributing to the economic activity of Australia. The contribution that small businesses make to the economy includes job creation, competitive power, economic growth and innovation. Furthermore, there is evidence that a flourishing small business sector can assist with creating and maintaining political and social stability.
It is widely acknowledged that businesses are operating in a turbulent, unstable and at times chaotic commercial environment. Many business operators are spending increasing amounts of their time responding to unanticipated events in circumstances where there is little or no time to plan solutions or build up resources. There has been little research into how small businesses respond to such unanticipated events.
A review of previous literature showed that business operators were likely to respond to unanticipated events in one of three ways; they either ignored the event, undertook planning or they improvised. The term 'improvisation' in this context was used to reflect either the time convergence between the realisation of a solution and its implementation or the application of selected resources for purposes other than that for which they were intended. A model of the process of improvisation was developed using the elements previously described in previous studies. The model falls into three parts; pre-improvisation, improvisation and post-improvisation.
The methodology used was a qualitative process consisting of a semi-structured interviews with twenty-nine owners of small-business start-up firms, to explore their experiences with dealing with unanticipated events and to try to establish the nature of the improvisational process. It was important for the participants to tell their stories of improvisation and for the researcher to reflect their experiences in relation to the model of improvisation.
The data collected provided greater insight into the process of improvisation and a refined model evolved which better represents the experience of participants. The study confirmed that small businesses do at times, use improvisation to respond to unanticipated events. Consequently, this study has made a significant contribution to the field by extending on the work undertaken to date and by the development of a model that more comprehensively represents the process of an improvisational response to an unanticipated event, in the context of small business.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small business</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Organizational change</field><field name="subject">Reengineering (Management)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060824.142152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting infidelity the role of attachment styles, lovestyles, and the investment model</field><field name="creator">Fricker, Julie</field><field name="description">Infidelity violates a western norm that a range of interpersonal behaviours
should remain exclusive in committed romantic relationships. Once exposed, the
aftermath can be detrimental to all concerned. However, despite a cultural majority
endorsing this belief and apprised of the potential consequences of its violations,
infidelity or extradyadic relationships are widespread. Furthermore, individual
differences in beliefs about what constitutes infidelity blur the boundaries of acceptable
behaviour, making the concept of unfaithfulness difficult to fully describe. This
variation in attitudes and behaviour, along with the consistent media attention infidelity
attracts affirms the enigmatic nature of the behaviour. In response, an aim of the study
was to clarify the construct of infidelity among a contemporary Australian sample. This
was achieved in two ways. Firstly, the study examined beliefs and behaviours
associated with unfaithfulness using qualitative (focus group) and largely quantitative
(survey) data. Secondly, the study involved investigation of the association between
infidelity and several individual, relationship and environmental variables. Differences
in relationships and environmental conditions can be conceptualised within the
theoretical framework of the investment model, while adult attachment theory and a
lovestyles typology offer theoretical underpinnings to the study of individual
differences. Specifically, the aim of this stage of the study was to examine how adult
attachment styles (anxious, avoidant), lovestyles (eros, ludus, storge, mania, pragma,
agape), relationship variables (satisfaction, investment, commitment), and an
environmental variable (perceived alternatives) predicted infidelity.
The sample comprised 243 women and 69 men between the ages of 18 and 60
years (M = 31.3 years, SD = 11.9) who were currently in a romantic relationship of at
least one year or who had recently been in such a relationship. Participants completed
measures pertaining to attachment, lovestyles and various aspects of relationship quality
in addition to several measures of extradyadic behaviour. The study found that
infidelity, as defined by respondents, was engaged in by 20% of individuals in their
current relationships and by 42% of individuals in their previous relationships.
Regarding the nature of infidelity, the current findings indicated that various sexual and
emotional behaviours carried out with someone other than one's primary partner were
considered unfaithful by the vast majority, while fantasy and flirting behaviours were
generally seen as acceptable. It was noteworthy, however, that a substantial minority also viewed fantasy as unfaithful, underlining the inherent complexity of the construct.
The hypotheses concerning the variables predicting infidelity were partially supported.
Results suggested that individuals most likely to engage in extradyadic behaviour were
those with an avoidant attachment style or a Ludus lovestyle, more perceived
alternatives to their relationship, and most unexpectedly, higher levels of investment in
their relationship. Conversely, those least likely to engage in these behaviours were
those with an Eros Lovestyle and greater levels of commitment to their relationship.
The study confirmed the prevalence of infidelity and emphasised the differential
attitudes, behaviours and motivations associated with it. These differences are discussed
in relation to the theories presented and an argument is made for research on infidelity
to take a broader focus, one that includes the combined aspects of individuals, their
relationships and the environment. Implications of these findings for individuals and
couples and for the professionals who work with them are discussed, along with
suggestions for future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adultery</field><field name="subject">Man-woman relationships</field><field name="subject">Attachment behavior</field><field name="subject">Infidelity</field><field name="subject">Adult Attachment theory</field><field name="subject">Lovestyles</field><field name="subject">Investment Model</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060828.095633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultrasonic inspection of gas porosity defects in aluminium die castings</field><field name="creator">Palanisamy, Suresh</field><field name="description">This thesis documents a PhD research program undertaken at Swinburne
University of Technology between the years 2000 and 2004. The research was
funded by the Cooperative Research Centre for Cast Metals Manufacturing and was
undertaken in collaboration with Nissan Casting Plant Australia Pty Ltd and the Ford
Motor Company Australia Limited. This thesis reports on the investigation of the
possibility of using an ultrasonic sensing-based, non-destructive testing system to
detect gas porosity defects in aluminium die casting parts with rough surfaces. The
initial intention was to develop a procedure to obtain ultrasonic signals with the
maximum possible amplitude from defects within the rough surface areas of the
castings. A further intention was to identify defects with the application of a suitable
signal processing technique to the raw ultrasonic signal. The literature review has
indicated that ultrasonic techniques have the potential to be used to detect subsurface
defects in castings. The possibility of classifying very weak ultrasonic signals
obtained from rough surface sections of castings through a neural network approach
was also mentioned in the literature. An extensive search of the literature has
indicated that ultrasonic sensing techniques have not been successfully used to detect
sub-surface defects in aluminium die castings with rough surfaces.
Ultrasonic inspection of castings is difficult due to the influence of
microstructural variations, surface roughness and the complex shape of castings. The
design of the experimental set-up used is also critical in developing a proper
inspection procedure. The experimental set-up of an A-scan ultrasonic inspection rig
used in the research is described in this thesis. Calibration of the apparatus used in
the inspection rig was carried out to ensure the reliability and repeatability of the
results. This thesis describes the procedure used to determine a suitable frequency
range for the inspection of CA313 aluminium alloy castings and detecting porosity
defects while accommodating material variations within the part. The results
obtained from ultrasonic immersion testing indicated that focused probes operating at
frequencies between 5 MHz and 10 MHz are best suited for the inspection of
castings with surface roughness Ra values varying between 50 [micro milli] and 100 [micro milli]. For
the purpose of validating the proposed inspection methodology, gas porosity defects
were simulated through side-drilled holes in the in-gate section of selected sample
castings. Castings with actual porosity defects were also used in this research.
One of the conclusions of this research was that it was extremely difficult to
detect defects in castings with surface roughness above 125 [micro milli]. Once the ultrasonic
signal data was obtained from the sample aluminium die castings with different
surface roughness values ranging from 5 [micro milli] to 150 [micro milli] signal analysis was carried
out. Signal feature extraction was achieved using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT),
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Wavelet Transforms (WT) prior to passing
the ultrasonic signals into a neural network for defect classification. MATLAB tools
were used for neural network and signal pre-processing analysis. The results
indicated that poor classification (less than 75%) was achieved with the WT, PCA
and combination of FFT/PCA and WT/PCA pre-processing techniques for rough
surface signals. However, the classification of the signals pre-processed with the
combination of WT/FFT, FFT/WT and FFT/WT/PCA classifiers provided much
better classification of more than 90% for smooth surface signals and 78% to 84%
for rough surface signals. The results obtained from ultrasonic testing of castings
with both real and simulated defects were validated with X-ray analysis of the
sample castings. The results obtained from this research encourage deeper
investigation of the detection and characterisation of sub-surface defects in castings
at the as-cast stage. Implications for the industrial application of these findings are
discussed and directions for further research presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminum castings</field><field name="subject">Porosity</field><field name="subject">Ultrasonic inspection</field><field name="subject">die castings</field><field name="subject">surface roughness</field><field name="subject">sub-surface defects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060828.103450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topographic distribution of human brain activity associated with cognitive processing in anxiety disorders</field><field name="creator">Athan, Donna Michelle</field><field name="description">Increased attention towards threatening stimuli in both the external and internal
environments is thought to be a factor in the causation and maintenance of pathological
anxiety. Attentional biases for threatening information have been demonstrated in anxiety
disorders, however the cortical mechanisms involved remain unclear. In this investigation,
an Emotional Stroop task consisting of neutral, positive, depression-related and anxietyrelated
words, was used to investigate attentional biases in 14 Panic Disorder patients and
32 psychiatrically healthy controls. The standard colour-word Stroop was also performed
to determine whether any general cognitive deficits exist in Panic Disorder. Steady-state
probe topography (SSPT), a brain electrical activity imaging methodology, was used to
investigate participants' brain activity during performance of the tasks. It was hypothesised
that Panic Disorder is associated with specific biases for disorder-specific information and
thus patients would exhibit increased interference for anxiety-related words only, compared
to neutral words. Mean reaction times for the Standard Stroop was similar for the two
groups. For the Emotional Stroop task, neither group showed an interference effect for any
emotional category. However, Panic Disorder patients performed the Emotional Stroop
significantly more slowly than the Controls. The SSPT data suggest that the Standard and
Emotional Stroop tasks are associated with different patterns of brain activity in the Control
and Panic Disorder groups despite the similarities in the reaction time data. Specifically,
the Standard Stroop was marked by strong temporo-parietal excitation in the Panic Disorder
group only. In addition, anterior SSVEP patterns further differentiated between the Control
and Panic Disorder groups. The most striking finding for the Emotional Stroop was strong
sustained bilateral temporo-parieto-occipital excitation in the Panic Disorder group. In
addition, a subgroup of the Controls exhibited increased interference for anxiety-related
words and therefore the brain activity for this group and the remainder of Controls who did
not show interference was analysed separately. It was found that the presence of
interference for anxiety-related words was associated with right prefrontal inhibition prior
to response. Other time-varying changes in the SSVEP further distinguished between the
subgroup of Controls who showed an interference effect and those who did not.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anxiety disorders</field><field name="subject">sspt</field><field name="subject">amplitude</field><field name="subject">latency</field><field name="subject">emotional processing</field><field name="subject">cognitive processing</field><field name="subject">emotional stroop</field><field name="subject">panic disorder</field><field name="subject">electrophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060904.115700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A form based meta-schema for information and knowledge elicitation</field><field name="creator">Wijesekera, Dhammika Harindra</field><field name="description">Knowledge is considered important for the survival and growth of an enterprise.
Currently knowledge is stored in various places including the bottom drawers of
employees. The human being is considered to be the most important knowledge
provider. Over the years knowledge based systems (KBS) have been developed to
capture and nurture the knowledge of domain experts. However, such systems were
considered to be separate and different from the traditional information systems
development. Many KBS development projects have failed. The main causes for such
failures have been recognised as the difficulties associated with the process of
knowledge elicitation, in particular the techniques and methods employed. On the other
hand, the main emphasis of information systems development has been in the areas of
data and information capture relating to transaction based systems. For knowledge to be
effectively captured and nurtured it is necessary for knowledge to be part of the
information systems development activity.
This thesis reports on a process of investigation and analysis conducted into the areas of
information, knowledge and the overlapping areas. This research advocates a hybrid
approach, where knowledge and information capture to be considered as one in a
unified environment. A meta-schema design based on Formal Object Role Modelling
(FORM), independent of implementation details, is introduced for this purpose. This is
considered to be a key contribution of this research activity. Both information and
knowledge is expected to be captured through this approach.
Meta data types are provided for the capture of business rules and they form part of the
knowledge base of an organisation. The integration of knowledge with data and
information is also described. XML is recognised by many as the preferred data
interchange language and it is investigated for the purpose of rule interchange. This
approach is expected to enable organisations to interchange business rules and their
meta-data, in addition to data and their schema. During interchange rules can be
interpreted and applied by receiving systems, thus providing a basis for intelligent
behaviour. With the emergence of new technologies such as the Internet the modelling of an
enterprise as a series of business processes has gained prominence. Enterprises are
moving towards integration, establishing well-described business processes within and
across enterprises, to include their customers and suppliers. The purpose is to derive a
common set of objectives and benefit from potential economic efficiencies. The
suggested meta-schema design can be used in the early phases of requirements
elicitation to specify, communicate, comprehend and refine various artefacts. This is
expected to encourage domain experts and knowledge analysts work towards describing
each business process and their interactions. Existing business processes can be
documented and business efficiencies can be achieved through a process of refinement.
The meta-schema design allows for a ?systems view? and sharing of such views, thus
enabling domain experts to focus on their area of specialisation whilst having an
understanding of other business areas and their facts. The design also allows for
synchronisation of mental models of experts and the knowledge analyst. This has been a
major issue with KBS development and one of the main reasons for the failure of such
projects. The intention of this research is to provide a facility to overcome this issue.
The natural language based FORM encourages verbalisation of the domain, hence
increasing the understanding and comprehension of available business facts.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">meta-schema</field><field name="subject">role modelling</field><field name="subject">rule base</field><field name="subject">conceptual modelling</field><field name="subject">business process</field><field name="subject">business process modelling</field><field name="subject">rule modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060904.123024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic data flow analysis for object oriented programs</field><field name="creator">Cain, Andrew Angus</field><field name="description">There are many tools and techniques to help developers debug and test their programs.
Dynamic data flow analysis is such a technique. Existing approaches for performing dynamic
data flow analysis for object oriented programs have tended to be data focused and procedural
in nature. An approach to dynamic data flow analysis that used object oriented principals would
provide a more natural solution to analysing object oriented programs.
Dynamic data flow analysis approaches consist of two primary aspects; a model of the data
flow information, and a method for collecting action information from a running program. The
model for data flow analysis presented in this thesis uses a meta-level object oriented approach.
To illustrate the application of this meta-level model, a model for the Java programming language
is presented. This provides an instantiation of the meta-level model provided. Finally,
several methods are presented for collecting action information from Java programs.
The meta-level model contains elements to represent both data items and scoping components
(i.e. methods, blocks, objects, and classes). At runtime the model is used to create a
representation of the executing program that is used to perform dynamic data flow analysis.
The structure of the model is created in such a way that locating the appropriate meta-level
entity follows the scoping rules of the language. In this way actions that are reported to the
meta-model are routed through the model to their corresponding meta-level elements.
The Java model presented contains classes that can be used to create the runtime representation
of the program under analysis. Events from the program under analysis are then used to
update the model. Using this information developers are able to locate where data items are
incorrectly used within their programs.
Methods for collecting action information from Java programs include source code instrumentation,
as used in earlier approaches, and approaches that use Java byte code transformation,
and the facilities of the Java Platform Debugger Architecture. While these approaches
aimed to achieve a comprehensive analysis, there are several issues that could not be resolved
using the approaches covered. Of the approaches presented byte code transformation is the
most practical.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Object-oriented programming (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Computer software</field><field name="subject">Testing</field><field name="subject">Java (Computer program language)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060904.161506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel optical fluorescence imaging probe for the investigation of biological function at the microscopic level</field><field name="creator">Dubaj, Vladimir</field><field name="description">Existing optic fibre-bundle based imaging probes have been successfully used to image
biological signals from tissue in direct contact with the probe tip (Hirano et al. 1996).
These fibre-bundle probe systems employed conventional fluorescence microscopy and
thus lacked spatial filtering or a scanned light source, two features used by laser
scanning confocal microscopes (LSCMs) to improve signal quality. Improving the
methods of imaging tissue in its natural state, deep in-vivo and at cellular resolution is
an ever-present goal in biological research. Within this study, a novel (580 &#956;m
diameter) optic fibre-bundle direct-contact imaging probe, employing a LSCM, was
developed to allow for improved imaging of deep biological tissue in-vivo. The new
LSCM/probe system possessed a spatial resolution of 10 &#956;m, and a temporal resolution
of 1 msec. The LSCM/probe system was compared to a previously used direct-contact
probe system that employed a conventional fluorescence microscope. Quantitative and
qualitative data indicated that the LSCM/probe system possessed superior image
contrast and quality. Furthermore, the LSCM/probe system was approximately 16 times
more effective at filtering unwanted contaminating light from regions below the
imaging plane (z-axis). The unique LSCM/probe system was applied to an exploratory
investigation of calcium activity of both glial and neuronal cells within the whisker
portion of the rat primary somatosensory cortex in-vivo. Fluorescence signals of 106
cells were recorded from 12 female Sprague Dawley rats aged between 7-8 weeks.
Fluo-3(AM) fluorophore based calcium fluctuations that coincided with 10 - 14 Hz
sinusoidal stimulation of rat whiskers for 0.5-1 second were observed in 8.5% of cells (9
of 106). Both increases and decreases in calcium levels that coincided with whisker
stimulation were observed. Of the 8.5 % of cells, 2.8% (3 cells) were categorized as
glial and 5.7% (6 cells) as neuronal, based on temporal characteristics of the observed
activity. The remaining cells (97 of 106) displayed sufficient calcium-based intensity
but no fluctuations that coincided with an applied stimulus. This was partially attributed
to electronic noise inherent in the prototype system obscuring potential very weak cell
signals. The results indicate that the novel LSCM/probe system is an advancement over
previously used systems that employed direct-contact imaging probes. The miniature
nature of the probe allows for insertion into soft tissue, like a hypodermic needle, and
provides access to a range of depths with minimal invasiveness. Furthermore, when
combined with selected dyes, the system allows for imaging of numerous forms of
activity at cellular resolution.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Confocal microscopy</field><field name="subject">Imaging systems in biology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060905.084615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prostate cancer support groups an evaluation</field><field name="creator">Walker, Sandra</field><field name="description">The population of Australia is increasing in age, consequently the incidence of
cancer diagnoses is rising. This rise will have a dramatic impact on hospitals with
much of the disease burden extending to psychological support for cancer care. At
present few men diagnosed with cancer seek support. This study sought to explore
men's perceptions of support and prostate cancer support groups.
The benefits of support groups for men with prostate cancer have been well
documented in international studies. In Australia however, relatively few men
diagnosed with prostate cancer join such groups and few studies have examined the
factors that influence membership and attendance. This study investigated the
experiences of a sample of 181 Australian men diagnosed with prostate cancer, 80 of
whom were members of support groups and 107 who were not. The participants were
recruited from prostate cancer support groups and an outpatient department of a major
cancer hospital, in Melbourne, Australia. The two groups were compared on a range
of factors, including disease characteristics, illness perceptions and views of prostate
cancer support groups. Further, members of support groups rated a number of
objectives to determine the effectiveness of the groups.
The majority of members recommended prostate cancer support groups to
other men with prostate cancer (92%), however of the non-members of prostate
cancer support groups, almost half (48%) had never heard of them. Factors that
discriminated between support group members and non-members were emotional
perceptions of the illness, symptom reports and illness coherence, with support group
members reporting higher scores on these variables. Length of diagnosis and age
were also factors that discriminated between the groups with support group members younger and diagnosed longer than non-members. There were no differences between
the groups on personal control, both groups reported high perceptions of control over
the disease. Members reported more benefits and less costs associated with prostate
cancer support groups than non-members. Benefits included information, support,
sharing experiences, and supporting other men with the disease. Costs included
negative discussions, other men dying, and the distance required to travel to the
groups. Both members and non-members reported distance to travel to the groups as
a major barrier to attendance. The majority of members had heard of the groups
through friends and, for non-members who had heard of the groups, through hospital
staff. General practitioners were one of the least likely sources of information about
prostate cancer support groups reported by members.
Prostate cancer support group members reported high levels of satisfaction
with the groups on a range of objectives outlined by the Cancer Council of Victoria.
Making friends and accessing community assistance exceeded men's expectations of
attendance, however men reported a desire for more information and communication.
A need for more funding, advertising, and recognition of prostate cancer support
groups by medical staff was also reported.
Many men with prostate cancer are unaware of support groups, however a
number of benefits were noted by both members and non-members. Greater
recognition of prostate cancer support groups by medical staff may provide men with
prostate cancer an opportunity to access those benefits. Health service providers
should consider the important role prostate cancer support groups play in the recovery
of men from prostate cancer and consider ways of dispelling myths men may hold
regarding the notion of support.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prostate</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Services</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Patients</field><field name="subject">Services</field><field name="subject">Self-help groups</field><field name="subject">Social networks</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060905.085536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New micropatterning techniques for the spatial addressable immobilization of proteins</field><field name="creator">Filipponi, Luisa</field><field name="description">Bio-microdevices are miniaturised devices based on biologically derived components
(e.g., DNA, proteins, and cells) combined or integrated with microfabricated substrates.
These devices are of interest for numerous applications, ranging from drug discovery, to
environmental monitoring, to tissue engineering. Before a bio-microdevice can be fully
developed, specific fabrication issues need to be addressed. One of the most important
is the spatial immobilization of selected biomolecules in specific micro-areas of the
device. Among the biomolecules of interest, the controlled immobilization of proteins to
surfaces is particularly challenging due to the complexity of these macromolecules and
their tendency to lose bioactivity during the immobilization step. The present Thesis
reports on three novel micropatterning techniques for the spatial immobilization of
proteins with bioactivity retention and improved read-out of the resulting micropatterns.
The technologies developed are based on three different micropatterning approaches,
namely 1) direct-writing UV laser microablation (proLAB), 2) a novel microcontact
printing method (&#65533;CPTA) and 3) a replica molding method combined with bead selfassembly
(BeadMicroArray). The first two technologies, proLAB and &#65533;CPTA, are an
implementation of existing techniques (laser ablation and &#65533;CP, respectively), whereas
the third, i.e., the BeadMicroArray, is a totally new technique and type of patterning
platform.
'ProLAB' is a technology that uses a micro-dissection tool equipped with a UV laser
(the LaserScissors&#65533;) for ablating a substrate made of a layer of ablatable material, gold,
deposited over a thin polymer layer. The latter layer is transparent to the laser but
favours protein adsorption. In the present work microchannels were chosen as the
structure of interest with the aim of arranging them in 'bar-codes', so to create an
'information-addressable' microarray. This platform was fabricated and its application
to specific antigen binding demonstrated.
The second technique that was developed is a microstamping method which exploits the
instability of a high-aspect ratio rubber stamp fabricated via soft-lithography. The
technique is denominated microcontact printing trapping air (&#65533;CPTA) since the collapsing of a rubber stamp made of an array of micro-pillars over a plane glass surface
resulted in the formation of a large air gap around the entire array. The method can be
successfully employed for printing micro-arrays of proteins, maintaining biological
activity. The technique was compared with robotic spotting and found that microarrays
obtained with the &#65533;CPTA method were more homogeneous and had a higher signal-tonoise
ratio.
The third technique developed, the BeadMicroArray, introduces a totally new platform
for the spatial addressable immobilization of proteins. It combines replica molding with
microbead self-assembling, resulting in a platform where diagnostic beads are entrapped
at the tip of micropillars arranged in a microarray format. The fabrication of the
BeadMicroArray involves depositing functional microbeads in an array of V-shaped
wells using spin coating. The deposition is totally random, and conditions were
optimised to fill about half the array during spin coating. After replica molding, the
resulting polymer mold contains pyramid-shaped posts with beads entrapped at the very
tip of the post. Thanks to the fabrication mode involved, every BeadMicroArray
fabricated contains a unique geometric code, therefore assigning a specific code to each
microarray. In the present work it was demonstrated that the functionality of the beads
after replica molding remains intact, and that proteins can be selectively immobilized on
the beads, for instance via biorecognition. The platform showed a remarkable level of
selectively which, together with an efficient blocking towards protein non-specific
adsorption, lead to a read-out characterized by a very good signal-to-noise. Also, after
recognition, a code was clearly visible, therefore showing the encoding capacity of this
unique microarray.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protein microarray</field><field name="subject">microcontact printing</field><field name="subject">laser ablation</field><field name="subject">soft-lithography</field><field name="subject">microbead</field><field name="subject">protein patterning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060905.113858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The learning driver : meeting traveller information needs</field><field name="creator">Karl, Charles A.</field><field name="description">In many parts of the world today, drivers have access to a growing range of traveller information services, from traffic reports on the radio and variable message signs along roads to customised information that could be delivered to personal mobile phones and PDAs (personal digital assistants) as well as to the global navigation units appearing in many vehicles.
The key commercial question is, what information does the driver want? So far, while traveller information services deliver increasingly sophisticated incident reports, journey times and other such information, driver response has remained lukewarm. This thesis suggests that the problem lies in understanding the driver rather than improving the content. Therefore, it has sought to establish: Q1. What do drivers already know?; Q2. How did they learn it?; Q3. What do drivers need now and in the future as they continue to learn? 

And for traveller information service providers, the related question:
Q4. How can information providers accommodate drivers' learning?
This thesis reports a qualitative case study based on ten in-depth interviews with drivers who had previously participated in a six week trial receiving customised traveller information about their commutes to and from work, through their mobile phones.
The thesis reports that drivers principally learn from their experiences in processes well established in the adult learning literature. It has found that commuter drivers can be regarded as experts on their commutes, but that the domain of any drivers' expertise is limited both spatially and temporally.

When presented with dynamic, customised traveller information, it was found that commuter drivers enter a learning curve affected by previous experience and immediate need in which learning to access and utilise appropriate travel information is a dynamic process. Drivers learn about using traveller information, they learn about the types of traveller information available and they also learn whether to trust the information provider.
As adults who learn and think, drivers see the role of an information service provider as facilitating their own understanding of the phenomena of traffic they face everyday and, in turn, supporting their learning to make better informed decisions. The thesis concludes that customised traveller information will become effective when it meets the current understanding and needs of the driver as an active learner whose information requirements change over time and from time to time.
This thesis contributes to an increased understanding of drivers, their knowledge and how they learn. As a result, it offers traveller information providers with a substantially increased understanding of how to meet their drivers' needs.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Traveller information</field><field name="subject">Adult learning</field><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">Information systems</field><field name="subject">Adult education</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060906.102946</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of non-executive directors in corporate governance : an evaluation</field><field name="creator">Siladi, Biserka</field><field name="description">Corporate governance has become an increasingly topical issue in recent years. This
has been fuelled by such corporate collapses as Enron, Worldcom, Parmalat, One.Tel
and HIH. The role and responsibility of the board and directors has emerged as an
important issue in examining the cause of these collapses. This has created much
debate on what the role of the directors is in 'directing', 'monitoring' or 'advising' a
company.
Research indicates that investors are prepared to a pay a premium for good
governance. This raises a number of questions. What is governance? How do we
determine what is good governance? What role do directors have in this? Does the
company's performance improve by adopting good governance practices?
There are numerous approaches to examining what makes a good board. Quantitative
techniques have included the use of such measurable concepts as the number of
executive and non-executive directors, directors' skill base (for example,
accountancy, marketing etc) and frequency of meetings attended. Researchers have
also attempted to measure board performance and effectiveness by using indicators
such as share values and shareholder returns.
There is a lack of qualitative research in board behaviour and effectiveness. This
exploratory study adopts a qualitative approach in order to provide richer data. It uses
interviews to evaluate directors' views on some aspects of corporate governance,
specifically in relation to the executive and non-executive director debate. The
interviews were conducted with 11 directors from a variety of organizations in the forprofit
and not-for-profit sectors.
Two major themes have emerged from the analysis of the interviews. Firstly, directors
are traditionally considered to be responsible for maximising shareholder wealth.
However, directors are now expected to broaden their responsibilities to include other
stakeholders and to consider social and environmental issues in making their
decisions. The findings indicate that it is now more demanding to be a director due to
increased workloads arising from the regulatory and legal requirements. This has also
impacted on director and board evaluations, multiple directorships and directors
remuneration levels.
The second major theme that emerged from this study is that directors' personal
experiences did not necessarily concur with governance principles and guidelines. For
example, the widely recommended method of achieving 'best practice' by having a
majority of non-executive directors on a board is considered too simplistic.
Further studies are required on the behavioural and personality traits, technical skills
of the directors, board structure, composition and type of organization which make the
best contribution to achieving boardroom effectiveness.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="subject">boards</field><field name="subject">non-executive directors</field><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060907.120343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The prediction and management of the variability of manufacturing operations</field><field name="creator">Steele, Clint</field><field name="description">Aim: To investigate methods that can be used to predict and manage the effects of

Methodology: The preliminary investigation is a review and analysis of probabilistic methods and
quality metrics. Based on this analysis, convenient robustification methods are
developed. In addition, the nature of the flow of variability in a system is considered.
This is then used to ascertain the information needed for an input variable when
predicting the quality of a proposed design.
The second, and major, part of the investigation is a case-by-case analysis of a
collection of manufacturing operations and material properties. Each is initially
analysed from first principles. On completion, the fundamental causes of variability of

of those characteristics has been determined. Where this determination was not possible,
qualitative conclusions about the variability are made instead. In each case, findings on

subjects respond to the mix of local and international students in their classes. The
aim is to develop a substantive theory based on a conceptual understanding of the
main concern of lecturers working in a changing Higher Education context.
The aim of developing theory rather than providing rich description led to the choice
of Orthodox Grounded Theory as the methodology. Grounded Theory is an inductive
methodology that provides the methods to conceptually generate the patterns that
explain the behaviours of participants in the substantive area. This was relevant for
the current research as I commenced with no explicit hypotheses and there was
limited literature on the responses of university lecturers to teaching diverse groups of
students, particularly a mix of local and international students.
Interviews and observations were conducted with lecturers from both traditional and
newer universities in Melbourne, and data analysed using open coding, categorising,
constant comparison, theoretical sampling and coding, and frequent memoing. The
main concern of respondents emerged as balancing professional capability with the
requirements of a heterogeneous student population. The Basic Social Process and
Core Category that resolves this concern is Maintaining Competence. Maintaining
Competence is both a causal-consequence model, and a typology model consisting of
four strategies &#65533; Distancing, Adapting, Clarifying and Relating.
The emergent Grounded Theory of Maintaining Competence contributes to the extant
literature, in particular the literature on professional competence, and the literature on
teacher centred and student centred approaches and on contextual and contingency
models of teaching. It adds to the latter by demonstrating the importance of the
interplay of moderating variables, specifically Forces in the Lecturer and Forces in the
Environment. The thesis adds also to the Grounded Theory literature in its explicit
presentation of Orthodox Grounded Theory methods and its discussion of the research
journey of a novice grounded theorist.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">competence</field><field name="subject">teaching approaches</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="subject">university lecturers</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060919.123623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High velocity clouds and the Milky Way Halo</field><field name="creator">Thom, Christopher</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an exploration of stars and gas in the halo of our Galaxy.

The stars make excellent tracers of the Milky Way halo, and we studied the kinematics
of a subset of the HES FHB stars, comparing their velocity dispersions to those predicted

make ideal probes of the distances to high-velocity clouds (HVCs) - clouds of neutral
hydrogen gas whose distances are largely unknown and which do not fit simple models
of Galaxy rotation. A catalogue of stars which align with the HVCs was developed. High
resolution spectroscopy of 16 such HVC probes with the Magellan telescope has yielded
a remarkably tight distance constraint to complex WB. This is one of only a handful of
such distance limits so far established. Lower distance limits were set for several other

difficult for surgeons with fewer than 500 surgical experiences. This was clearly
demonstrated by Kohn, Busche and Cans (1995), and confirmed by Sommer,
Friederich and Muller (2000), Sudhahar, Glasgow and Donell (2004), and Kuga,
Yasuda, Hata et al. (2004). The above research indicates that the problem is not only
one of anatomical location, but of how the operation takes place. The aim of the
research was, therefore, to develop a new and improved surgical instrument and
technique for locating the ACL anatomical landmarks.
The research described in this thesis employs a number of design methods that can be
used separately or in combination (hybrid process). They form the theory base that
guides the design process. This allows the designer to engage in a flexible process that is
effective in finding design solutions to the problem. Within this process, iterative case
studies were employed in order to design a new surgical device for ACL reconstruction.
The thesis describes a series of designed devices (case studies) that were iteratively
developed and surgically tested, leading to a penultimate device. This latter device was
tested via a number of surgical operations. The device provides a new method for
externally locating the internal ACL attachment points.
The research has resulted in a commercial association with Smith and Nephew Surgical
Australia and BrainLAB AG Germany for the commercialisation of this technique. At
the time of writing, the next stage of research and development is under way. This is
using a frameless computer-aided image guidance system in the place of X-ray.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">industrial design</field><field name="subject">product design</field><field name="subject">anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction</field><field name="subject">orthopaedic</field><field name="subject">surgical instrument</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061006.130922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of a dark halo substructure</field><field name="creator">Gill, Stuart P. D.</field><field name="description">In this dissertation we analyse the dark matter substructure dynamics within a
series of high-resolution cosmological galaxy clusters simulations generated with the
N-body code MLAPM.
Two new halo finding algorithms were designed to aid in this analysis. The
first of these was the 'MLAPM-halo-nder' (MHF), built upon the adaptive grid structure
of MLAPM. The second was the 'MLAPM-halo-tracker' (MHT), an extension of MHF
which allowed the tracking of orbital characteristics of gravitationally bound objects
through any given cosmological N-body-simulation. Using these codes we followed
the time evolution of hundreds of satellite galaxies within the simulated clusters.
These clusters were chosen to sample a variety of formation histories, ages, and
triaxialities; despite their obvious differences, we and striking similarities within
the associated substructure populations. Namely, the radial distribution of these
substructure satellites follows a 'universal' radial distribution irrespective of the
host halo's environment and formation history. Further, this universal substructure
profile is anti-biased with respect to the underlying dark matter profile. All satellite
orbits follow nearly the same eccentricity distribution with a correlation between
eccentricity and pericentre. The destruction rate of the substructure population is
nearly independent of the mass, age, and triaxiality of the host halo. There are,
however, subtle differences in the velocity anisotropy of the satellite distribution.
We nd that the local velocity bias at all radii is greater than unity for all halos
and this increases as we move closer to the halo centre, where it varies from 1.1 to
1.4. For the global velocity bias we nd a small but slightly positive bias, although
when we restrict the global velocity bias calculation to satellites that have had at
least one orbit, the bias is essentially removed.
Following this general analysis we focused on three specific questions regarding
the evolution of substructures within dark matter halos.
Observations of the Virgo and Coma clusters have shown that their galaxies align with the principal axis of the cluster. Further, a recent statistical analysis of some
300 Abell clusters conrm this alignment, linking it to the dynamical state of the
cluster. Within our simulations the apocentres of the satellite orbits are preferentially
found within a cone of opening angle 40 degrees around the major axis of the host
halo, in accordance with the observed anisotropy found in galaxy clusters. We do,
however, note that a link to the dynamical age of the cluster is not well established.
Further analysis connects this distribution to the infall pattern of satellites along
the filaments, rather than some 'dynamical selection' during their life within the
host's virial radius.
We then focused our attention on the outskirts of clusters investigating the socalled
'backsplash population', i.e. satellite galaxies that once were inside the virial
radius of the host but now reside beyond it. We and that this population is significant in number and needs to be appreciated when interpreting empirical galaxy
morphology-environmental relationships and decoupling the degeneracy between nature
and nurture. Specifically, we and that approximately half of the galaxies with
current clustercentric distance in the interval 1- 2 virial radii of the host are backsplash
galaxies which once penetrated deep into the cluster potential, with 90% of
these entering to within 50% of the virial radius. These galaxies have undergone
significant tidal disruption, losing on average 40% of their mass. This results in a
mass function for the backsplash population different to those galaxies infalling for
the first time. We further show that these two populations are kinematically distinct
and should be observable spectroscopically.
Finally we present a detailed study of the real and integrals-of-motion space
distributions of a disrupting satellite obtained from one of our self-consistent highresolution
cosmological simulations. The satellite has been re-simulated using various
analytical halo potentials and we and that its debris appears as a coherent
structure in integrals-of-motion space in all models ('live' and analytical potential)
although the distribution is significantly smeared for the live host halo. The primary
mechanism for the dispersion is the mass growth of the host. However, when
quantitatively comparing the effects of 'live' and time-varying host potentials we
conclude that not all of the dispersion can be accounted for by the steady growth
of the host's mass. We ascribe the remaining differences to additional effects in the
'live' halo such as non-sphericity of the host and interactions with other satellites,
which have not been modelled analytically.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">astrophysics</field><field name="subject">cosmology</field><field name="subject">galaxy clusters</field><field name="subject">computation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061009.115152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fantasy China an investigation of the Huangmei Opera Film genre through the documentary film medium</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yeong-Rury</field><field name="description">This doctoral research project intends to institute the study of the unique
and significant Huangmei Opera film genre by pioneering in making a
series of documentaries and writing an academic text. The combination
of a documentary series and academic writing not only explores the
relationship between the distinctive characteristics of the Huangmei Opera
film genre and its enduring popularity for its fans, but also advances a film
research mode grounded in practitioner research, where the activity of
filmmaking and the study of film theory support and reflect on each other.
The documentary series, which incorporates three interrelated subjects
- Classic Beauty: Le Di, Scenic Writing Director: Li Han Hsiang and
Brother Lian: Ling Po - explores the remarkable film careers of each figure
while discussing the social and cultural context in which they worked.
The section on Le Di introduces the subject of melodrama as a Chinese
tradition. The section on Li Han Hsiang discusses Li's film aesthetics and
his representation of a utopian Chinese world of the imagination. The final
section focuses on the popularity actor Ling Po gained through her roles of
male impersonation. All three topics provide an opportunity to rethink our
understanding of the social, political and cultural forces that contribute to
the genre, and to build an emotional connection between past and present
for the viewers. Meanwhile, by interviewing those surviving key figures
and assembling materials that have been lost, the documentary series not
only fulfils the needs of many fans, but also serves field studies in the area
by setting a direction in research and providing a valuable resource for
scholars involved in Chinese film and cultural studies. It is both accessible
to mainstream audiences and academically warranted.
As an adjunct to the documentary series, the written text explores
aspects of the same material in more depth through the use of structuralist
methodology, and psychoanalytic, auteur and genre theories. The text
combines these Western approaches with aspects of Chinese culture,
philosophy and aesthetic traditions, proposing links between Chinese
aesthetics and Western film theories that contribute new understandings
to both Chinese and Western film studies. On the other hand, because
these film theories were originally developed to study Western films, the
Chinese origins of the Huangmei Opera film genre may challenge existing
theoretical paradigms and so provide new interpretations. This doctoral
project also includes a complete report of all phases of the documentary
production and design process, and a unique, comprehensive filmography
of Huangmei Opera films, and as such supplies a research foundation
for both documentary filmmakers and academics who are interested in
studying the Huangmei Opera film genre further.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Huangmei Opera Film genre</field><field name="subject">Documentary film media</field><field name="subject">cinema study</field><field name="subject">gender research</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061009.132620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Passive mixing in microchannels with geometric variations</field><field name="creator">Wang, Hengzi</field><field name="description">This research project was part of the microfluidic program in the CRC for Microtechnology,
Australia, during 2000 to 2003. The aim of this research was to investigate the feasibility of
applying geometric variations in a microchannel to create effects other than pure molecular
diffusion to enhance microfluidic mixing. Geometric variations included the shape of a
microchannel, as well as the various obstacle structures inside the microchannel.
Generally, before performing chemical or biological analysis, samples and reagents
need to be mixed together thoroughly. This is particularly important in miniaturized Total
Analysis Systems (&#65533;TAS), where mixing is critical for the detection stage. In scaling
down dimensions of micro-devices, diffusion becomes an efficient method for achieving
homogenous solutions when the characteristic length of the channels becomes sufficiently
small. In the case of pressure driven flow, it is necessary to use wider microchannels to
ensure fluids can be pumped through the channels and the volume of fluid can provide
sufficient signal intensity for detection. However, a relatively wide microchannel makes
mixing by virtue of pure molecular diffusion a very slow process in a confined volume of
a microfluidic device. Therefore, mixing is a challenge and improved methods need to be
found for microfluidic applications.
In this research, passive mixing using geometric variations in microchannels was studied
due to its advantages over active mixing in terms of simplicity and ease of fabrication.
Because of the nature of laminar flow in a microchannel, the geometric variations were designed
to improve lateral convection to increase cross-stream diffusion. Previous research
using this approach was limited, and a detailed research program using computational fluid
dynamic (CFD) solvers, various shapes, sizes and layouts of geometric structures was undertaken
for the first time. Experimental measurements, published experimental data and analytical predictions were used to validate the simulations for selected samples. Mixing
efficiency was evaluated by using mass fraction distributions. It was found that the overall
performance of a micromixer should include the pressure drop in a microdevice, therefore,
a mixing index criterion was formulated in this research to combine the effect of mixing
efficiency and pressure drop. The mixing index was used to determine optimum parameters
for enhanced mixing, as well as establish design guidelines for such devices.
Three types of geometric variations were researched. First, partitioning in channels
was used to divide fluids into mixing zones with different concentrations. Various designs
were investigated, and while these provided many potential solutions to achieving good
mixing, they were difficult to fabricate. Secondly, structures were used to create lateral
convection, or secondary flows. Most of the work in this category used obstacles to disrupt
the flow. It was found that symmetric layouts of obstacles in a channel had little effect
on mixing, whereas, asymmetric arrangements created lateral convection to enhance crossstream
diffusion and increase mixing. Finally, structures that could create complex 3D
advections were investigated. At high Reynolds numbers (Re = 50), 3D ramping or obstacles
generated strong lateral convection. Microchannels with 3D slanted grooves were
also investigated. Mixers with grooved surfaces generated helicity at low Reynolds numbers
(Re &#65533; 5) and provided a promising way to reduce the diffusion path in microchannels
by stretching and folding of fluid streams. Deeper grooves resulted in better mixing efficiency.
The 3D helical advection created by the patterned grooves in a microchannel was
studied by using particle tracing algorithms developed in this research to generate streaklines
and Poincare maps, which were used to evaluate the mixing performance. The results
illustrated that all the types of mixers could provide solutions to microfluidic mixing when
dimensional parameters were optimized.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mixing</field><field name="subject">microfluidics</field><field name="subject">MEMS</field><field name="subject">micromixer</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061013.162737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual art dialogue in personal psychological learning a private journey with public relevance</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Loris</field><field name="description">Understanding and managing emotion in psychological therapy is a complex
and challenging problem for practitioners and clients. The traditional
emphasis on verbal language as the mediating process in therapy is expanding
with the inclusion of multimodal creative arts, based on visual, auditory, and
kinaesthetic perceptions, to better support the reaccessing of emotion. This
can be followed recursively by the use of words to develop narrative and
meaning. The main research emphasis in this thesis was on visual art. Studies
of other art forms may follow. Philosophical understanding, neuroscience
advances and developments in psychological therapy underpin and explain
this therapeutic expansion.
A qualitative research approach is taken, engaging several different actions
from within that research paradigm. The thesis is written as a metaphorical
journey and conveys the experience of art dialogue and the experience of
researching, as parallel stories. Psychological learning journeys undertaken by
its author and a colleague, some clients, therapists and teachers, are described
in three encounters.
The first encounter explored visual art dialogue as a process addition to a
developing experiential phenomenological approach using multimodal
creative arts (The MIECAT Process &#65533; Lett 2001). The objective was for the
colleagues to experience a lengthy creative arts sequence, developing and
undertaking the process of visual art dialogue. Multilevel actions and
outcomes were recorded throughout the collegial engagement. The collegial
encounter required that the co-researchers pursue their own personal
psychological meanings and report on their experience of the process.
Personal narrative meanings exposed in exploring visual art dialogue, are not
discussed, the emphasis being on confirming how actions occurred and their
effectiveness for application. Actions stopped where direct verbal therapeutic
engagement might occur.
Following collegial experience, visual art dialogue was used with clients and
other therapists and teachers, to question its broader relevance. The second
inquiry, involving three clients of the author, asked how the process would
support professional actions in a therapeutic situation. The third encounter
engaged other therapists and teachers to expand on questions of by whom
and how, art dialogue could be used.
Psychological therapy theory suggests process location within a humanistic
framework, in an eclectic focus or supporting the development of an
experiential, phenomenological psychology process approach based on the
known functions of mind and body. The associated personal and professional
aspects of the experience of process exploration constituted a step in authorial
understanding and may contribute to increasing knowledge of the creative
arts applied to psychological therapy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative arts</field><field name="subject">psychological therapy</field><field name="subject">personal emotional learning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061006.153107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From individual to social foresight</field><field name="creator">Hayward, Peter C.</field><field name="description">To this point in time humanity has successfully responded to the challenges to its
existence. A viewpoint becoming widespread is that humanity will have to respond
to even greater challenges to its existence in the future. If adequate responses are
not formulated to these emerging challenges then a dystopian future for humanity
is a strong possibility. While experience can teach us how to act in the future it is
the express intent of this research that we should not have to experience dystopia
in order to learn how to prevent it. The innate human capacity for foresight has
played a pivotal role in responding to past challenges, however, a more extensive
form of foresight will need to be developed to respond to these future challenges.
That form of foresight will need to be both individual and social in nature.
Part I of this thesis generates an original theory of how foresight could develop
in individuals beyond our innate capacities. The theory argues that foresight ca-
pacities develop through the expansion of individual consciousness, particularly the
individual's sense of `self'. The theory is synthesised from the work of a num-
ber of psychological researchers including Jean Piaget, Jane Loevinger, Lawrence
Kohlberg, Clare Graves, Susan Cook-Greuter and Ken Wilber.
Part II is a two year study of students undertaking a postgraduate course in
strategic foresight. The study is utilised to add preliminary empirical support to
the theory proposed in Part I.
Part III integrates the previous two parts to further elaborate the attributes and
dynamics of individual foresight development before describing how social foresight
capacity can emerge from individual development. Expanded individual and so-
cial foresight capacities are achievable, but cannot be assumed. The contribution
of this thesis is to give a theoretical base to such development and to outline fur-
ther research. The development of individual foresight and the emergence of social
expressions of foresight can offer preferable, and not dystopian, futures for both
current and future generations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forecasting</field><field name="subject">Prediction (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Social prediction</field><field name="subject">College students</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061108.153623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On adaptive random testing</field><field name="creator">Kuo, Fei-Ching</field><field name="description">Adaptive random testing (ART) has been proposed as an enhancement to random
testing for situations where failure-causing inputs are clustered together. The basic
idea of ART is to evenly spread test cases throughout the input domain. It has
been shown by simulations and empirical analysis that ART frequently outperforms
random testing. However, there are some outstanding issues on the cost-effectiveness
and practicality of ART, which are the main foci of this thesis.
Firstly, this thesis examines the basic factors that have an impact on the faultdetection
effectiveness of adaptive random testing, and identifies favourable and
unfavourable conditions for ART. Our study concludes that favourable conditions
for ART occur more frequently than unfavourable conditions. Secondly, since all
previous studies allow duplicate test cases, there has been a concern whether adaptive
random testing performs better than random testing because ART uses fewer
duplicate test cases. This thesis confirms that it is the even spread rather than less
duplication of test cases which makes ART perform better than RT. Given that the
even spread is the main pillar of the success of ART, an investigation has been conducted
to study the relevance and appropriateness of several existing metrics of even
spreading. Thirdly, the practicality of ART has been challenged for nonnumeric or
high dimensional input domains. This thesis provides solutions that address these
concerns. Finally, a new problem solving technique, namely, mirroring, has been
developed. The integration of mirroring with adaptive random testing has been
empirically shown to significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of ART.
In summary, this thesis significantly contributes to both the foundation and the
practical applications of adaptive random testing.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer software testing; adaptive random testing; random testing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061109.091517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Market segementation and domestic electricity supply in Victoria</field><field name="creator">Sharam, Andrea</field><field name="description">If the observations of unregulated and recently deregulated essential services were to hold
for electricity reform, we could expect to see market segmentation of household
customers. This is a corporate strategy aimed at the acquisition of attractive customers
and the avoidance of unattractive customers. It is a function of market relations and
commodification. Some markets already segment and assign unattractive customers to
'residual' markets, 'sub-prime' markets or 'markets of last resort'. Residual markets tend to
involve market abuse by suppliers because these customers lack market power. It is
possible therefore to suggest that segmented markets are characterised by simultaneous
competition and monopoly. The implications for the supply of essential services, such as
electricity, are profound. This research sought to identify whether there is evidence of
emerging segmentation of the domestic electricity market in Victoria.
In practice, few essential services areas are completely deregulated. The history of
segmentation in the US insurance and lending industries provides valuable insights into
markets, market failure and social protections. Taking this history and the more recent
experiences of reforms in the US, the UK and Australia, it has been possible to identify
three models of social protection: 'universal service', a 'civil rights' model, and a 'market'
model. The Victorian reforms reflect some elements of each of these. The social
protections included in the reform package both encourage and present barriers to market
segmentation. At the time of the research, some elements of the safety net arrangements
and customer inertia (born out of negative attitudes to competition) have acted to inhibit
segmentation. Customer inertia in its own right poses questions for the efficacy of
competition policy.
The key understanding that is gained from this research is that both civil rights and socioeconomic
entitlements (social rights) are required to prevent markets in essential services
acting upon and exacerbating inequality. This suggests that universal service, as a model
of social protection, is most likely to ameliorate the impacts of inequality.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Market segmentation; domestic electricity; victoria; Electric power production</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061109.101315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Healthy and harmful adolescent attachment, conflict, and anger</field><field name="creator">Pearson,, Kaileen Leanne</field><field name="description">The major focus of this study was to investigate the association between adolescent
attachment styles and types of parent-adolescent conflict and anger. The study used
adolescent respondents (n=214, females=136, males=78), 95% of whom were aged 14
or 15. The methodology was a one-off survey design. An adapted adult attachment
scale with two dimensions, anxiety and avoidance, measured attachment. This scale
was used to form four adolescent attachment styles, secure, preoccupied, fearful and
dismissive. Family conflict was assessed in a range of ways, including general
measures of self-reported family conflict and abuse at home. Also measured were
general anger-proneness and depression-proneness. As well, adolescents responded to
four specific, hypothetical parent-adolescent conflict scenarios. The responses to these
vignettes included their reported emotions, conflict resolution strategies, expected
endings and post-conflict coping/risk behaviours.
Results indicated the presence of one major healthy and functional conflict-anger
pattern associated with a secure attachment style, and two major types of harmful and
dysfunctional conflict-anger patterns. Healthy conflict and anger involved secure
adolescents reporting they would experience negative emotions in conflict but would
still expect the conflict to be resolved well for everyone. Secure adolescents were also
less anger-prone and depression-prone generally than other adolescents, possibly
indicating their ability to regulate their negative emotions. The first harmful conflict
pattern, associated with preoccupied and fearful attachment styles, included relatively
higher levels of family conflict involving poor conflict endings, and even moderate
levels of violence. Preoccupied and fearful adolescents may have poor emotional
regulation, as indicated by their higher levels of general anger-proneness and
depression-proneness. The second harmful conflict-anger pattern was associated with
a dismissive attachment style and involved conflict with emotional distance and
coolness in the family, as well as lower levels of reported problem solving strategies
and good conflict endings. Results are discussed in terms of adolescent attachment
style profiles and the need to distinguish and assess attachment styles in families in
order to devise appropriate and effective interventions. Examples of primary,
secondary and tertiary preventative interventions are described to assist mildly to
severely conflicted, distressed or disengaged families.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adolescent</field><field name="subject">Attachment</field><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">anger</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">parent and teenager</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061110.092422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of mobile phone emitted electromagnetic fields on human brain activity and performance</field><field name="creator">Hamblin, Denise Lee</field><field name="description">As mobile phone connections approach two billion worldwide and become steadily
more available and affordable, demands for scientific studies on the effect of such
EMFs on human functioning similarly increase. The current thesis systematically
investigated the effects of acute mobile phone exposure on human brain activity and
performance using an in-vivo approach. The research question comprised the following
parts: First, is human neural function sensitive to acute mobile phone exposure? Second,
if so, what processes are affected? Third, if so, do these neural changes affect gross
measures of performance or behaviour?
A review of the previous literature found that there was some, but not conclusive
evidence that mobile phone exposure affects neural function and some aspects of human
performance, and that the studies in question required replication with reliable and
realistic dosimetry, double-blinding and additional technical tests to ensure that the
experimental set-up was free of artefact contamination. A pilot study was conducted to
provide an indication of possible future results, assist in the formation of hypotheses for
the main study, and highlight what technical issues required attention before the main
study could begin.
Results of the pilot study indicated that EMFs emitted by GSM900 mobile phones may
alter human brain activity during an auditory task, particularly in proximity to the
phone. Both early sensory and later more cognitive ERP components were significantly
altered during active compared to sham exposure. Results also suggested that mobile
phone exposure may hinder human performance, with longer RTs during the active
exposure relative to the sham exposure. However, due to the small sample size of the
pilot investigation and questions remaining as to possible technical limitations of the
study, these results were treated with caution and used primarily in the formation of
future hypotheses for the larger experimental study.
Subsequent technical tests provided improvement and validation of the experimental
set-up and exposure delivery system, and ensured that future research would be free
from such technical limitations. These tests included the characterisation of spectral
emissions by the test phone; ensuring that EMFs emitted by the test phones would not interfere with, nor distort, data from the response pad or that processed by the electrode
leads; determining whether electrode leads cause an increase or decrease in SAR; and
examining the issue of experimenter interference. These tests enabled the conclusion
that a positive finding from the large experimental trial would be due to the active
exposure of the mobile phone, or in the case of a null finding, would not be due to
insufficient or unreliable exposure.
Applying the knowledge gained from these technical tests, the main study aimed to
provide results of a definitive nature by employing a sample size of 120 sufficient
statistical power to detect relatively subtle effects, and a stringent methodological
design to account for past limitations. The main study also increased the scope of
investigation beyond that achieved in previous research by including endpoints related
to sensory processing (auditory and visual tasks), higher cognitive processing
(cardsorting task), performance (reaction time and accuracy) and cortical activation
(EEG alpha power). To increase this scope even further, within these tasks, the study
used data from each scalp electrode and offered insights into the effect of laterality
(ipsi- versus contralateral in relation to the exposure source), psychological arousal,
perception of transmission, and between-subject factors such as age, gender, previous
mobile phone use and hemisphere exposed (right versus left hemisphere exposure).
The results of the main study suggested that acute exposure to GSM900 mobile phone
significantly reduced levels of psychological arousal, particularly in relation to selfratings
of Energy. Results also indicated that only minutes of active exposure can lead
to enhanced alpha EEG activity during active exposure relative to sham exposure.
Interestingly, this effect was found to be transient, decreasing below sham levels after
ten minutes of active exposure and up until ten minutes after exposure cessation. These
exposure-induced changes in EEG alpha power were here interpreted as representing an
overall reduction in integrative brain function, possibly caused by the physiological
response to neural interference or altered synaptic transmission.
Acute exposure did not alter human brain activity in the form of the early sensory or
later cognitive ERP responses during an auditory or visual task, or EEG synchronisation
during a higher cognitive task. The findings also suggested that resultant behaviour, as
indexed by RT and accuracy, is unaffected by exposure. Conversely, exploration into specific groups within the sample resulted in some interesting interactions, which raised
the possibility that active mobile phone exposure may affect individuals differently as a
function of age, gender and which hemisphere is exposed. Specifically, the auditory
processing of older individuals was particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of
mobile phone exposure compared to their younger counterparts. Results of the visual
task suggested that the performance of females may also be particularly vulnerable to
the detrimental effects of active exposure, compared to males.
Overall, the present study has confirmed that there are mobile phone-related bioeffects
at the low levels that mobile phones are permitted to operate at. Although various
effects have been observed, there is no indication from the present results that
cumulative effects or any health consequences exist as this was not the focus of the
research. It is argued that future investigation into mobile phone-related bioeffects
should apply more sophisticated methodologies to the investigation of acute exposure
on EEG alpha power and higher cognitive functioning, as well as larger sample sizes
and fewer carefully planned comparisons in order to detect small effects. Further
investigation into exposure-induced effects on different groups according to age, gender
and which hemisphere is exposed should also be a priority.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mobile phones</field><field name="subject">electromagnetic fields</field><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">electroencephalography</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061110.100936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical evaluation of exchange traded option 'Delta' as a risk management tool for self-managed superannuation funds</field><field name="creator">Enticott, Steven John</field><field name="description">This research discusses the use of Delta in regulating the investment behaviour of the
Trustees of Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs) who use Exchange Traded
Options (ETOs) in their investment strategies.
An ETO represents a contract between two parties, giving the taker (the buyer) the
right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a parcel of shares at a predetermined price,
on or before a predetermined date, to or from the writer (the seller).
It is acceptable for SMSF Trustees to use ETO investments as part of their overall
investment strategy, providing that leverage or mere speculation are not the reasons
behind that investment.
It is important to note that neither the Regulator, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO),
nor its predecessor, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA), actually
state what constitutes 'speculation', or what the allowable uses for derivatives are.
There are no practical guidelines. This is a key issue for this research, which aims, as
practically as possible, to fill these crucial gaps.
A Trustee must abide by their superannuation fund's overriding covenants and
investment strategy, and inform its members, through Risk Management Statements, of
the trust's derivative strategy.
While ETOs can be used to manage risk, they also carry a level of risk themselves.
Delta measures an ETO's value movement in correlation with a movement in the
option's underlying share price. An ETO carrying a low Delta generally means a
cheaper price (premium) per contract than an option carrying a higher Delta. The lower
the Delta, however, the lower the chance there is of a positive result for the buyer. This
research shows that an ETO Delta of less than 0.2 gives results in favour of buyers in
only 11 out of 100 occurrences. This figure rises to 42 out of 100 when Delta is greater
than 0.8.
From the sampled data, there is an overall financial loss to the buyer of -1.91%, with
the financial return results being mixed at all levels of Delta. The overall return results
have been compiled without preference to market direction, and clearly highlight the
natural premium bias (which the buyer pays) to the seller. What this data does is reenforce
the need for Trustees to have a solid view of market directions, or a set
strategy in place, as buyers of ETOs.
The conclusions drawn from the findings show that the chance of loss (when buying),
or gain (when selling) ETOs with a Delta of;
- less than 0.20 is 89%;
- less than 0.40 is 74%;
- less than 0.60 is 66%;
- less than 0.80 is 57%;
- greater than 0.80 is 58%;
For example, a Trustee buying an ETO with a Delta of less than 0.20, faces an 89%
chance of loss; a Trustee selling an ETO with a Delta of less than 0.20, faces an 89%
chance of gain.
The findings on overall financial returns (profit or loss) offer additional support to this
critical review of Delta as a risk measurement tool. Whist it is impossible to know the
motives or actual positions of portfolio managers of SMSF at any time, the aim of the
thesis is to provide a measurement tool that can be used to assist the trustee at any
given time by measuring the option risk element alone. When interpreting the findings,
the reader must remember that ETO strategies are numerous, and a high-risk profile
for one strategy may represent a low risk for another. Further to this, an ETO strategy's
risk profile may change with the overlaying of another ETO. For example, where a Call
option is bought, the risk involved in that purchase is represented by the premium paid.
However, another Call option can then be sold against that position, with a later (or
earlier) date to expiry, and with a higher strike price. This 'overlay' reduces the initial
risk, but impacts on the maximum gain.
It is vital that Trustees have a solid understanding of the basics of ETO strategies
before considering using Delta as a measure of risk. The research proposes some
guidelines Trustees can use when assessing an ETO strategy against their
derivative/investment risk profile.

The findings from 2400 data samples show strong trends in support of the underlying
premise (see Figure: Positive Results Versus Delta (ETO Buyers) below). Given these
findings, the research concludes that Delta can be used as a measure of risk by SMSF
Trustees. Delta may not be suitable, however, for measuring multiple layers of
combined ETO positions, a type of derivative strategy not suited to or usual in the
context of measuring risk within a SMSF.

There is a major difference between simple and simplistic solutions offering practical
answers in an environment of increasing complexity. Often, simple solutions offer far
more value to the less experienced, when compared to complex ones, especially given
the growing number of SMSFs, and the increasing lack of expertise in the areas of
superannuation and risk management that this growth implies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">options</field><field name="subject">ETO</field><field name="subject">SMSF</field><field name="subject">Delta</field><field name="subject">self managed superannuation funds</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061117.125347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and development of liquid crystal lenses</field><field name="creator">Ashraf, Mujahid Al Islam</field><field name="description">The use of optics in the fields of nano-technology, telecommunication and
medicine has been growing exponentially in recent years. Application of liquid
crystals within optics has been a growing trend from flat screen displays to
variable focus lenses in a digital versatile discs.
One area of the recent developments within optics has been the development of
two-photon fluorescence microscopy and high-density three-dimensional optical
data storage. In such applications, where a light beam has to be focused deep
within the volume of bulk media, aberrations are introduced. The most dominant
aberration is spherical aberration which results from the mismatch in refractive
indices of the immersion and recording media. The aim of this thesis is to design a
liquid crystal lens for dynamic tube length compensation of the spherical
aberration.
Liquid crystal phase plates are used in everyday liquid crystal displays (LCDs)
such as mobile phones and calculators. The technologies required to manufacture
a liquid crystal phase plate are well understood. However, an application like
three-dimensional data storage requires different properties in the liquid crystal
phase plate, which are investigated in this thesis. To fabricate our liquid crystal
phase plate we used ZLI-5049-000 from MERCK as the liquid crystal medium,
with poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) and Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) providing the
insulating and conducting layers, respectively. It has been demonstrated that
vacuum vapour deposition can be used to coat a glass substrate with ITO.
However, in order for the ITO coating to be conductive a method is developed
where the substrate is heated to 300oC before, during and after the coating.
Similarly, a method has been developed for producing a uniform 10 &#956;m coating of
PVA on top of the ITO.
In order to produce a liquid crystal lens with the properties required to compensate
for spherical aberration an investigation into the properties of the liquid crystals is
first conducted. A liquid crystal phase plate described in chapter 3 is characterised
to determine the effect of the rubbing direction of the insulating layer and the
effective refractive index change with applied voltage. It has been demonstrated
that an effective change in refractive index of 0.11 can be achieved with 30 volts
applied across the ITO electrodes.
Based on the characterisation of the liquid crystal phase plate four different liquid
crystal lens designs have been proposed and tested. The lens designs are based
upon convergent and divergent lenses with different refractive index lens
substrates. It is determined that a liquid crystal lens with a divergent lens substrate
with a refractive index of 1.785 can be used to effectively compensate for
spherical aberration. This has been confirmed experimentally by using the liquid
crystal lens in a two-photon confocal microscope and measuring a increase in
detected intensity at a depth below the surface of a sample.
The research conducted in this thesis shows the ability to dynamically compensate
for spherical aberration introduced by a mismatch in the refractive indices
between the immersion and sample mediums. It has also been demonstrated that
new methods for fabricating the conductive and insulating layers are suitable for
producing a liquid crystal lens. A liquid crystal lens based on the research in this
thesis could be used in three-dimensional data storage or microscopy applications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">liquid crystal lenses design</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061117.145625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimised part programs for excimer laser-ablation micromachining directly from 3D CAD models</field><field name="creator">Mutapcic, Emir</field><field name="description">Fabrication of a 3D structure and surface texture using excimer laser mask
projection ablation processes typically requires the machine operator to develop a specific
NC part program for the desired structure geometry, and also incorporate appropriate
machine parameters to achieve the desired surface finish. The capability of the laser
ablation process could therefore be significantly improved by developing a CAD/CAM
system that automatically generates the NC part program using the 3D information of the
CAD model of the desired structure. Accordingly, the focus of this research was to
develop such a system that is, an effective CAD/CAM system specifically for excimer
laser mask projection micromachining tools.
To meet these requirements, a unique combination of commercially available
systems was used to develop the new CAD/CAM system. The systems used comprised of
a computer aided, feature based parametric design system (SolidWorks), together with
its extended programming capabilities based on Automated Programming Interface (API)
functions for Windows applications, and Visual Basic (VB) 6.0 programming utilities.
The system's algorithms use a novel methodology to extract the 3D geometry of a
microstructure. Two different techniques have been developed to extract the 3D data.
First, where 3D geometry information from a CAD model was defined as a Stereolithography
(STL) file, and second, where this information has been contained in a set of
bit-map (BMP) files that represent a sliced or layered structure of a CAD model. Based
on this, first an algorithm to create NC part programs to support Step-and-repeat
micromachining technique was developed and then successfully extended to be applicable
for another commonly used micromachining method, Workpiece-Dragging technique.
The systems algorithms for both techniques are based on the raster-colour
programming technique, resulting in substantially reduced mathematical complexity and
computational time. This is the first time this approach has been used to support direct
conversion of 3D geometry from a CAD model into an NC part program compatible with
the excimer laser CNC controller. 2D mathematical models for controlling edge and
stitching errors were also implemented in the system.
An additional technique, named as 'Common Nest' has been developed with the
aim to enable automatic NC part programming when microstructure design to be
completed successfully, requires use of multiple complex mask patterns as a projection
tool instead of just a single square aperture.
The effectiveness of the system was verified by NC part program generation for
several 3D microstructures and subsequent machining trials using polycarbonate (PC) and
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and optimised processing parameters. Excellent
agreement was obtained between the laser machined geometries and the microstructure
CAD models. The Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (LSCM) measured the lateral
dimensions tolerance of 2m.
The system was also successfully applied for a practical micro-engineering
application, for the development of a microfluidics cell transportation device.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">excimer lasers</field><field name="subject">micromachining</field><field name="subject">3D microstructures</field><field name="subject">CAD/CAM</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061117.154651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immunomodulatory effects of traditional Chinese herbal formulation, ginseng and dang gui ten combination (PS10)</field><field name="creator">Thomsen, Michael</field><field name="description">The severe debility and immune dysfunction associated with serious
disease may respond well to treatment with the tonic formulas from
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). One of these, Ginseng and Dang
Gui Ten Combination has gained prominence as the formula most
suitable to assist convalescence after chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
A literature review of the herbal combination suggests that it
synergistically provides a broad range of pharmacological activity with
a very low level of toxicity. The herbs may have haemopoietic,
antimutagenic, antitumour, immunomodulatory and anticomplement
activities and they seem to promote lymphocyte activation, interleukin
production, protect various organs against toxicity, inflammation and
ulceration, and promote drug delivery and radiation sensitising while
protecting healthy tissue.
The specific immunomodulatory effects of PS10 combination were
investigated in 10 healthy volunteers (7 males and 3 females aged 43
to 58 years). The study was a longitudinal study (28 days), using a
repeated measures design to investigate the pre and then post
intervention changes in Natural Killer (NK) cell activity as well as total
and differentiated lymphocyte counts. Furthermore, liver function
tests (LFT) were included to assess any adverse effects on the liver. It
was envisaged that NK cells or other white blood cell subset variation
could indicate an immunomodulatory effect of the herbal formulation,
PS10.
Investigative methodologies included NK cell function assessment via
the ability of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to lyse the human
erythroleukemia cell line K562.(Lozzio and Lozzio, 1975) Target cells
are labelled by incubation with radioactive chromium, washed, then
added to a dilution series of PBMC's and incubated for 4 hours.
Supernatants are harvested and the amount of intracellular chromium-
51 released into the supernatant is measured with a gamma counter.
The amount of chromium-51 released is proportional to the lytic
activity of the NK cells. The gradient of the line of best fit through the
plotted points was recorded as the measure of cytotoxicity or
killing.(Brooks and Flannery, 1980) The steeper the gradient, the
greater the cytotoxicity.
This pilot study demonstrated that the herbal preparation Ginseng and
Dang Gui Ten Combination (PS10) increased the total number of
lymphocytes cells in healthy human volunteers (n=10) (p&amp;lt0.007).
Although the test formulation increased NK cell activity in some
participants, the change in mean NK cell cytotoxicity was not
significant.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herbal medicine</field><field name="subject">traditional chinese medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061128.123722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineers, entrepreneurs &amp; wealth-creation from idea to product</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Alistair John</field><field name="description">The paradigms that examine and describe the nature of the entrepreneurship process
have generally been linear, following the lead of the more mature management and
physical sciences. This emulation of linear methodologies has occurred despite
indications from authors such as Bygrave, Shaver and Mitton of their being less
appropriate at this relatively early stage of the social science of entrepreneurship. When
examining the nature of a phenomenon such as entrepreneurship, statistical correlations
and linear descriptions are limited to confirmation of existing hypotheses. The
underlying assumption is that the correct questions are known. However this
assumption becomes moot when seeking to include the many unpredictable, non-linear
aspects that add the key human vitality of entrepreneurship. This research seeks to move
toward a more complete description than linearity alone is able to capture.
The research presents a non-linear paradigm, being a holistic combination of the
rational evidence of entrepreneurship and what might be termed the spiritual or
intangible aspects that together constitute the observed craft of entrepreneurship. The
research highlights the dynamic skill-set used by entrepreneurs to balance key elements
in the entrepreneurial process, in a way that achieves a relational coherence. The focus
is on the high-tech industry which is especially prone to the use of linear descriptions of
the entrepreneurship process which takes a new idea and leads it to become a successful
product.
Interviews with entrepreneurship practitioners involved in the creation of new ventures
in the high-tech industry form the database against which this non-linear paradigm is
investigated. The results confirm that the success of the entrepreneurial process depends
on far more than the linear descriptions that are commonly used to describe the process.
Once the basics are in place, entrepreneurs appear to shift their focus to achieving a
multi-dimensional integration among what they identify as the key elements in the
entrepreneurial process. This is achieved despite apparent disorder and chaos being
evident in the process of new venture creation.
Entrepreneurs appear to make sense of the confusing non-linearity by focussing on the
relational attributes among elements in the new venture. The use of the non-linear
relational paradigm (NLRP) developed from the results of this research, enables a more
holistic understanding of the empirically observed process of entrepreneurship. This has
some significant implications for the management and evaluation of nascent technology
enterprises.
The NLRP's additional fix on the entrepreneurship process, can be used to inform the
venture capital industry when trying to predict the likelihood of success of prospective
ventures vying for funds. The NLRP's alternative view could also translate into more
appropriate new venture management once funded, and thus better success rates for
nascent ventures. The NLRP's insights on the way in which entrepreneurs create and
grow new ventures, can improve best-practice techniques for entrepreneurs and
influence the way in which entrepreneurship education is approached. Describing
innovation and entrepreneurship more holistically also has important implications for all
facets of industry that include a process of design, or seek to create wealth.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">non-linear</field><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">innovation</field><field name="subject">High technology industries</field><field name="subject">Businesspeople</field><field name="subject">New business enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061205.164435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing interorganisational relationships an in-depth study in a hospital context</field><field name="creator">Owen, Karen</field><field name="description">Can interorganisational relationships be managed for effective functioning? This is
the problem investigated in this research. Organisations world-wide are adopting
co-operative relationships with other organisations. These interorganisational
relationships are viewed as a way to enhance their own business performance
(Williamson 1985, 1991; Dyer 1997; Gulati 1998; Barringer &amp; Harrison 2000; Das
&amp; Teng 2000; Quinn 2000; Stuart 2000; Johnson, Korsgaard &amp; Sapienza 2002).
Despite this, the success rate for interorganisational relationships is not high (Hutt,
Stafford, Walker &amp; Reingen 2000; Quinn 2000; Hitt, Ireland &amp; Vaidyanath 2002)
with many of them failing to achieve their objectives. Understanding how to
manage these boundary-spanning arrangements is important to realising the
objectives of the business strategy.
The research setting is a large private hospital in Australia. It works with a
network of external service organisations that provide the Hospital with a range of
clinical and non-clinical support services including: Diagnostic Imaging, Pathology
Pharmacy, Food Services, Environmental Services, and Human Resources support.
This research explores how these different relationships were managed in their
operating period: 1998 to 2002. It reveals the dynamic and often ad hoc way, in
which managers made sense of the collaborative service context, and how
managers influenced the process of interorganisational relationship formation.
Extant research about interorganisational relationships comes from a variety of
fields. For this research it is most relevant to draw from the research fields of
organisational theory, organisation behaviour, sociology, psychology and
management. These fields contribute findings that provide useful knowledge upon
which to build further understanding about how managers contribute to construct
interorganisational relationships functioning (Ring &amp; Van de Ven 1992, 1994;
Walsh 1995; Chikudate 1999a, 1999b; Boddy, Macbeth &amp; Wagner 2000; Hutt,
Stafford, Walker &amp; Reingen 2000; Lasker, Weiss &amp; Miller 2001).
This research uses an interpretivist methodology that enables the researcher to
explore the dynamic nature of the Manager's sense-making in the construction of
six interorganisational relationships. For the purposes of this research,
interorganisational relationships are defined as new structures that emerge through
the social interaction of actors involved in shared service delivery. The
collaborative context of interorganisational relationships stimulates managers'
sense-making by challenging institutionalised ways of behaving. This sensemaking
process builds new knowledge stores and contributes to emerging, new
management routines. The process is transformative and enables the emergence of
interorganisational relationships.
It emerges from this research that managers take cues from their context. These
cues are used to interpret and make assessments that enable decisions about those
actions that they take to construct the interorganisational relationships. A
manager's processing of contextual cues, through interpretive frames and
dispositional sense-making filters, is an inter-subjective, socially constructive
process. The 'self' is a dimensional influence in the managers' sense-making and
management behaviours and is implicated through the notion of contextual
interpretive frames and dispositional sense-making filters. A model of
interorganisational relationship management as a transformational process is
developed. The association between contextual influences and managers'
behaviours will raise awareness for professional practitioners of the challenges
involved in managing across organisational boundaries and in turn, may contribute
to more successful implementation of interorganisational business relationships.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sense-making</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">outsourcing</field><field name="subject">inter-organisational relationships</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">self</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">constructivist</field><field name="subject">narrative</field><field name="subject">reflexive interpretation</field><field name="subject">reflection</field><field name="subject">knowledge construction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20061206.115448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of somatosensory evoked potentials in the prediction of outcome in brain injured children</field><field name="creator">Carter, Bradley Graham</field><field name="description">This thesis describes studies assessing the ability of somatosensory evoked potentials
(SEPs) to predict outcome following severe brain injury by examining outcome and
determining the predictive value of SEPs directly and in comparison to alternative tests
in both patients and systematic reviews of the literature.
Outcome was assessed using a functional and quality of life measure. It changed over
time and was influenced by age, mechanism, timing and the type of outcome measure.
When 5 year functional outcome was used, sensitivity and specificity for the initial
SEPs were 63.2% and 93.3% with a positive predictive value of 92.3% for favourable
outcome and 66.7%, 94.7% and 90.9% for unfavourable outcome prediction. SEPs
predictive performance varied and was better in patients with 1 year outcomes, when
outcome was measured with the quality of life tool and in patients suffering hypoxicischaemic
encephalopathy. Importantly, only twelve false positives were identified in
the systematic review of 55 studies from 903 patients with bilaterally absent SEPs.
Eight of these false positives suffered focal lesions of the brain stem, large cerebral
fluid collections or recent decompressive craniectomy which cause SEPs to be absent
because of a mechanical disruption to the electrical signal.
Comparisons between SEPs and other tests in the patient cohort and wider literature
showed that SEPs were the best overall predictors of outcome but were outperformed
by some clinical tests in specific areas. Specificity for unfavourable outcome prediction
was better for ICP, CPP and the last pupillary response. In patients with any cause of
brain injury, the combination of SEPs and Motor responses provided the best
predictions for unfavourable outcome while for favourable outcome the best overall
prediction and specificity were achieved with a combination of either SEPs or Motor
responses and the best sensitivity with pupillary responses alone or a combination of
either SEPs or Pupillary responses.
The studies in this thesis provide a detailed evaluation of SEPs and showed that SEPs
have a place in the prediction of outcome, alone or in combination with existing tests.
Overall, they are superior to clinical tests and can be easily obtained at the bedside
and in the presence of pharmacological paralysis and analgesia/sedation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">somatosensory evoked potentials</field><field name="subject">brain injury</field><field name="subject">outcome</field><field name="subject">prediction</field><field name="subject">traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">non-traumatic brain injury</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070130.153020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning from the past, providing for our future : an exploration of traditional Paiwanese craft as inspiration for contemporary ceramics</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yu Hsin</field><field name="description">This project started with the Taiwanese&#65533;s Cultural &amp; Creative Industries Policy,
which demands that all new products include local cultural content. However, little
is known about Taiwanese cultures. This research looked specifically at one of the
cultures, the Paiwanese Tribe.
This thesis reports on the research journey; identifying what the Paiwanese knew
about their culture and why they were unable to produce traditional products. It
argues that the displacement of the tribe has made it materially impossible to
continue traditional practices. This research then identified ways of capturing spirit
of traditional culture using modern technology. A successful model of working with
crafts people workshops in discussed. A case is made for the use of narrative
enquiry and oral history to record Paiwanese understanding. These
understandings were translated into a design outcome using a design method
called narrative design. The success of this research suggests that such an
approach is one model that can be used in design using new technologies and
materials from the re-establishment method of traditional products.
The understanding generated for regaining traditional craft knowledge is extended
with the design of a tea set that draws on this traditional knowledge, narrative and
culture. The tea set represents this knowledge for a global market. It is argued that
the design process used can guide design that transforms the culture message
and delivers it for a wide audience. This design concept process is a model that
can be used to develop cultural products.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paiwanese tribe</field><field name="subject">cultural products</field><field name="subject">narrative enquiry</field><field name="subject">oral history</field><field name="subject">narrative design</field><field name="subject">taiwan aborigines</field><field name="subject">cultural &amp; creative industries</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070205.101252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on the complex evanescent focal region of a high numerical aperture objective and its applications</field><field name="creator">Jia, Baohua</field><field name="description">In recent years, optical near-field has received an ever-increasing attention owing to
its ability to localise optical signals beyond the diffraction limit. Optical near-field is
a non-propagating field existing in the close vicinity of a matter within a range less
than the wavelength of the illumination light and it carries the high spatial frequency
information showing the fine details of the matter.
An optical near-field can be generated by a near-field optical microscope with a
nano-aperture or a metal-coated fibre tip. However, common difficulties associated
with this approach, such as a fragile probe, a low throughput and signal-to-noise ratio,
and a slow response of gap controlling between the probe and the sample, make it
less applicable. Alternatively, optical near-field can be produced by total internal
reflection (TIR) occurring at the interface of a prism, which is capable of localising
the electromagnetic (EM) field in the close vicinity of the interface. However, in this
geometry, no confinement of the field can be achieved in the transverse direction,
whereas, in most applications such as optical trapping, micro-fabrication and optical
data storage, a transverse confinement of the light field is essential.
In order to achieve a transverse confinement of the light field, maintaining the
high spatial resolution of the optical near-field, and at the same time eliminating
the drawbacks associated with the conventional near-field optical microscope, a novel
near-field probe based on a high numerical aperture (NA) TIR objective combined
with annular illumination has been developed recently. In this arrangement, an
obstruction disk is inserted at the back aperture of the objective to block the light
with a convergence angle lower than the critical angle determined by the refractive
indices of the two media, resulting in a pure focused evanescent field in the second
medium.
The evanescent field produced by this method provides a useful tool for studying
light-matter interaction at the single molecule level not only because of its high
resolution but also due to its inherent merits such as no distance regulation, no heating
effect and simple experimental setup. But, the most significant advantage that makes
this method unique and superior to the other approaches in terms of producing the
optical near-field is that it allows the dynamic control of the focal field by simply
modulating the phase or amplitude or even the polarisation state of the incident beam
before it enters the objective so that complex illumination beams can be generated,
whereas in other fibre probe based approaches this goal is extremely difficult to achieve.
To make use of such a novel near-field probe, a thorough theoretical and
experimental investigation is required. A complete knowledge of the focused evanescent
field is a prerequisite for a wide range of applications including single molecule
detection, Raman spectroscopy, near-field non-linear imaging and near-field trapping.
Therefore, it is not only necessary but also urgent to exploit the focusing properties
of a focused evanescent field under complex field illumination both experimentally and
theoretically and this is the major aim of this thesis.
The complex fields, which are of particular interest in this thesis, are the radially
polarised beam and the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam, because the former owns a
more compact circularly symmetric field distribution in the focal region when focused
by a high NA objective, while the latter is capable of rotating a trapped particle
by transferring the orbital angular momentum. Combining them with the focused
evanescent field is potentially able to induce novel functions in the near-field region,
which cannot be fulfilled by other near-field approaches. In this thesis, in order to
generate these two types of beams, a single liquid crystal spatial light modulator
(LCSLM) is employed to produce useful phase modulation to the incident beam.
Experimental characterisation of an evanescent focal spot is performed with
scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), which is capable of providing the direct
mapping of the focused evanescent field not only because of its high spatial resolution
and its ability to detect the near-field and far-field signals simultaneously, but also due
to the motion of the piezzo-stage enables a three-dimensional characterisation of the
evanescent focal spot.
In this thesis, a SNOM system with an aluminum coated aperture probe is
implemented. The field distributions at both the interface and parallel planes with
a small distance away from the interface are obtained. To verify the applicability of
SNOM as a characterisation methodology, the field distribution in the focal region
of a high NA objective illuminated by a linearly polarised plane wave is measured
first. A focus splitting along the direction of incident polarisation is observed threedimensionally
near the interface under such a circumstance. It has been demonstrated
that the depolarisation effect plays an important role in determining the coupling
behaviour of the light into the fibre probe of SNOM. The good match between the
experimental results and theoretical predications confirms the validity of SNOM.
Theoretical investigation of a tightly focused radially polarised beam is undertaken
based on the vectorial-Debye diffraction theory because under the tight focusing of a
high NA objective, the vectorial nature of the highly localised field has to be carefully
considered in order to represent the field distribution accurately. The calculations
on the focusing properties of a radially polarised beam suggest that the longitudinal
field component in the focal region plays a dominant role in determining the overall
field distribution. Direct measurement of the focused evanescent radially polarised
beam in a three-dimensional manner near the interface is performed with SNOM. A
highly localised focal spot is achieved in the close vicinity of the coverglass. The
measured intensity distributions from SNOM show that correction of the focal spot
deformation associated with a linearly polarised beam is achieved by taking advantage
of the radially symmetric focal spot of a radially polarised beam. A smaller focal spot is
acquired due to the dominant longitudinal polarisation component in the focal region,
which possesses a more compact focal intensity distribution than that of the overall
field. The experimental results demonstrate a good agreement with the theoretical
expectations.
The fact that a radially polarised beam is capable of eliminating the focus
deformation often presented in the focal region of a high NA objective when a linearly
polarised beam is employed can be very useful in many applications, including microfabrication
using two-photon photopolymerisation technique. The theoretical study
on the two-photon point spread function (PSF) of a radially polarised beam indicates
that the focus elongation and splitting associated with a linearly polarised beam are
eliminated and the achievable lateral size of the focal spot is approximately a quarter
of the illumination wavelength, which is less than half of that under the illumination
of a linearly polarised beam. A further reductiont of the lateral size can be expected
by using annular radial beam illumination.
The investigation on the focusing properties of LG beams has also been one of
the major tasks of this thesis. Theoretical investigations of a focused evanescent LG
beam suggest that the phase shift induced by the boundary effect when a light beam
passes the interface satisfying TIR condition plays a vital role in determining the
overall shape of the total field distribution. A severe focal intensity deformation is
predicted theoretically in the case of focused evanescent LG beam illumination, which
might involve new physical phenomena when applied in the near-field trapping. Such
a focal intensity deformation is evidenced experimentally by the direct mapping result
obtained from the SNOM probe. A quantitative cross-section comparison with the
theoretical predication is conducted, which demonstrates a good agreement.
To achieve a controllable optical trap and rotation in the near-field region, complex
optical fields such as LG beams carrying orbital angular momentum, have been induced
for the manipulation of a polystyrene particle. The influence of the focal intensity
deformation on a near-field trapping has been thoroughly investigated. Rotation
motion of the particle is examined by mapping the two-dimensional (2D) transverse
trapping efficiency of the particle. Theoretical investigation reveals that a significant
tangential force component is generated on the particle when it is illuminated by a
focused evanescent LG beam. Such findings may prove useful in introducing a rotation
mechanism in near-field trapping.
The research investigations and methodologies described in this thesis provide a new
approach to characterise the near-field focal spot under complex field illumination.
It enhances the understanding of the novel near-field probe, thus opening the
pathway for numerous near-field applications including optical trapping, two-photon
excitation (photopolymerisation) and spectroscopy. The focal field rotation phenomena
demonstrated in this thesis may prove particularly beneficial in introducing a rotation
mechanism in near-field trapping using a focused evanescent field.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evanescent field</field><field name="subject">scanning near-field microscopy</field><field name="subject">high angle diffraction theory</field><field name="subject">total internal reflection objective</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070205.150740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality in use : addressing and validating affective requirements</field><field name="creator">Bentley, Brian Todd</field><field name="description">From a user's perspective, product quality has typically been equated to usability, where the primary focus is performance (i.e. efficiency and effectiveness) and user satisfaction. This view on quality has been adequate to validate the 'fitness for purpose' for many products. However, many other products, such as computer games or at-home-technologies, are not based solely on performance-based qualities. By defining and validating the quality of these non-performance-based technologies using the same measures as performance-based technologies fails to address a key quality &#65533; the ability of the product to create fun, enjoyment, or other user affective experiences. This thesis investigates system quality issues in non-performance-based technologies, primarily addressing affect. It explores what affect is in relation to system quality, how can affect impact quality in use, what product characteristics can aid in the creation of positive user affect, and how to validate whether a product successfully created the desired user affect. To begin, current knowledge about the relationship between systems development, quality in use, and affect is summarised. Concepts used synonymously with affect were studied (e.g. satisfaction, user experience, emotion). It was found that these are related to affect, but are not affect themselves. Following this, a broad survey asking users to identify product characteristics that create positive affect during use is reported on. Results showed that the system characteristics of learnability, feedback, curiosity, and user cooperation can each increase and enhance positive user affect experienced. 
If it is an aim for the system to create an affective experience in a user then this should be considered a requirement of the system; and as a requirement, it is necessary to validate that it achieves this aim. To this end, a laboratory study exploring psycho-physiology and cued-recall debrief as methods to evaluate user affect was conducted. Results revealed that both methods show promise for evaluating user affect. Cued-recall is capable of identifying specific user affects, but is limited because it relies on the user to report these affects. Physiological measures can objectively identify when a person is experiencing affect, but is limited because it is not possible to determine what affect is being experienced. Combined, these methods represent an optimal and viable evaluation method for user affect.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">affect</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">psychophysiology</field><field name="subject">system quality</field><field name="subject">quality in use</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070214.143122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laser assisted machining of high chromium white cast-iron</field><field name="creator">Armitage, Kelly</field><field name="description">Laser-assisted machining has been considered as an alternative for difficult-to-machine
materials such as metallic alloys and ceramics. Machining of some materials such as
high chromium alloys and high strength steels is still a delicate and challenging task.
Conventional machines or computer numerical control (CNC) machines and cutting
tools cannot adapt easily to such materials and induce very high costs for operations of
rough machining or finishing. If laser-assisted machining can be implemented
successfully for such materials, it will offer several advantages over the traditional
methods including longer tool life, shorter machining time and reduced overall costs.
This thesis presents the results of the research conducted on laser assisted machining of
hard to wear materials used in making heavy duty mineral processing equipment for the
mining industry. Experimental set up using a high power Nd:YAG laser beam attached
to a lathe has been developed to machine these materials using cubic boron nitride
(CBN) based cutting tools. The laser beam was positioned so that it was heating a point
on the surface of the workpiece directly before it passed under the cutting tool. Cutting
forces were measured during laser assisted machining and were compared to those
measured during conventional machining.
Results from the experiments show that with the right cutting parameters and laser beam
position, laser assisted machining results in a reduction in cutting forces compared to
conventional machining.
A mathematical thermal model was used to predict temperatures within the workpiece at
depths under the laser beam spot. The model was used to determine the effect of
various cutting and laser parameters on the temperature profile within the workpiece.
This study shows that laser assisted machining of hard to wear materials such as high
chromium white cast iron shows potential as a possible economical alternative to
conventional machining methods. Further research is needed before it can be
introduced in industry as an alternative to conventional machining.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">white cast-iron</field><field name="subject">Laser assisted machining</field><field name="subject">hard machining</field><field name="subject">Nd:YAG</field><field name="subject">CNN</field><field name="subject">Laser machining</field><field name="subject">temperature modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070214.155302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visuality and tacit knowledge the application of multiple intelligences theory to the design of user expeience in interactive multimedia contexts</field><field name="creator">Huang, Chi</field><field name="description">The major challenge for multimedia designers is to create user experiences that enrich the reception of content, designer&#65533;s traditional reliance on intuition not ensuring audience&#65533;s interest or understanding. The developing philosophy of user-centred design argues that designers should begin from an appreciation of their audience. In design there are various positions on how to achieve this, ranging from traditional market research through psychological, ethnographic, anthropological and sociological research to the direct involvement of users in the design process. This study draws on established knowledge about the cognitive processes, psychological motivations and preferences of user groups to advance a model for better-targeted and more effective design. In particular, it uses Howard Gardener&#65533;s multiple intelligences theory to extend design thinking. Where a specific audience is apparent multiple intelligences theory implies that (1) the interface should match user&#65533;s perceptual tools, cognitive styles and responses and (2) there is far greater scope than presently recognized to vary the design of the graphical user interface. The research explores how interactive multimedia can harness the &#65533;language of vision&#65533; (Johannes Itten) for certain audiences, in this case Taiwanese drawing students aiming to enter tertiary art and design programs where high academic drawing skills are an important selection criterion. The high &#65533;visual intelligence&#65533; of the target audience indicates their heightened capacity to process visual concepts and elements. The application of Gardner&#65533;s ideas is a speculative one, based on hypothesis and the formulation of an experimental graphical user interface environment built around predominantly visual cues. The designed outcome incorporates knowledge and understanding that is widely applicable to GUI design, challenging designers to develop multimedia products with innovative, imaginative design approaches that cater for the different needs and interests of users where the audience is a specific and identifiable one.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interactive multimedia</field><field name="subject">Multiple intelligences</field><field name="subject">Graphical user interfaces (Computer systems)</field><field name="subject">user-centred design</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070214.163710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The murder in merger : developmental processes of a corporate merger and the struggle between life and death impulses</field><field name="creator">De Gooijer, Jinette</field><field name="description">This thesis contends that a corporate merger, on the scale of a global order, is a
'catastrophic change' and depends on 'killing off' parts of the former organisations for its
success. The act of annihilating parts of the former organisations is experienced as disengaged
and murderous by organisational members. This arouses persecutory anxiety of an unbearable
intensity amongst members from which they defend themselves by emotionally disconnecting
from the psychic reality of the organisation.
Several contentions underpin the hypothesis:
1. that a merger involves a developmental process in the creation and growth of a new
organisation;
2. the event of a merger causes disruptions to roles and relationships that are
experienced as a loss of power, status and identity, and also as an emotional loss for
what had been cherished and valued in the former organisation/s;
3. the emotional loss evokes the symbolic experience of the loss of a 'loved object',
and an instinctual loss becomes attached thereby to the real losses; and thus,
4. the process of merger involves a symbolic destruction of the 'loved organisational
object' of the former organisations, as held in the minds of organisational members.
The thesis is based on case study research conducted on the topic of emotional
connectedness in a network organisation over a three year period. Fieldwork began at the time
when the participating firm had just formed from a global merger of two large global
enterprises. The Australia-New Zealand regional operations were the focus of the study.
The research discovered a significant degree of emotional disconnectedness due to:
1. the nature of the work that required staff to work on client sites, away from home
and often alone;
2. a multiplicity of organisational structures that engendered fragmentary connections;
3. valuing individuals' self-reliance over and above the interdependence of
organisational members;
4. the many external changes experienced by the firm from the effects of the merger
and from market economics, political and business turmoil, and for the Australia-
New Zealand operations, a shift in the location of their corporate head office from
North America to Europe;
5. increasing uncertainty within the industry, and a commensurate increase in
competitiveness;
6. a loss of profitability in the Asia-Pacific region in which the case study participants
were located;
7. the turnover in the regional director's role, with three appointments in less than
two years;
8. dramatic rises and falls in staff numbers, ranging from an initial 450, to a high of
750, and sudden decline to 120 people during the period of the study;
9. the reluctance of vice-presidents and directors to take up a corporate management
role, preferring to work as 'project managers' on client assignments; and
10. all these factors contributing to an anxiety about the future of the Australia-New
Zealand (A-NZ) operations which was expressed as a fear of survival.
In response to these many factors, staff and management felt vulnerable and insecure,
experiencing the merger as an annihilation of 'loved objects'. These included the loss of a
partner's autonomy and ownership in the firm, familiar work procedures, and the loss of
belonging to a partner's work group and associated long-term relationships. The emotional
aspects of dealing with these losses and feelings were placed upon individuals to manage for
themselves. The burden of ensuring the survival of the firm was displaced upon individuals,
such that consultants became not only the 'container for work', but also the 'container for the
organisation's survival'.
As the merger progressed and more changes to the business were implemented with
little to no containment of people's felt experiences, the psychic reality of the A-NZ
operations became saturated with persecutory anxiety. In some parts of these operations, the
anxiety became so great that group interactions (what there were of them) seemed psychotic.
Those in management roles displayed a level of anxiety that appeared to be unbearable for the
individuals concerned, and which resulted at times in manic responses to the human and
commercial needs of the business.
Bion's theories of catastrophic change and emotional links, and Klein's theories on
persecutory and depressive anxieties are applied to understanding the systems psychodynamics
of the effects of the merger upon the organisation. The case reveals the presence of
persecutory anxiety in the immediate aftermath of the merger, lasting for nearly three years.
Various social defence mechanisms are identified as being used by organisational members
against this anxiety. They are: the co-existence of multiple organisational structures; a sentient
sub-system of 'counselling families'; idealisation of autonomous individuals; plus, the
mechanisms of projection, denial and regression.
Four factors are identified as significant for containing destructive forces in a corporate
merger: a) the role of emotional links to understanding the internal reality of a newly merged
organisation; b) the containment of experiences of catastrophic change and projective
processes; c) managing the realistic and neurotic anxieties of organisational members; and,
d) identifying and managing the primary risk in a merger.
A model is presented on the systems psychodynamics of a corporate merger. It
identifies the change process that a merger entails, and the psychodynamics of this process
using Bion's concept of container'contained.
The thesis contributes to understanding the psychic reality of organisational mergers
and offers a perspective that being alert to staff members' felt experiences and their emotional
connectedness, as a normal part of business, provides 'leading data' on the health of the
enterprise. Managers who are more 'wholly' informed about organisational realities, both
external and psychic realities, can work more realistically on resolving problems, assessing
risks, or making strategic business decisions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">systems psychodynamics</field><field name="subject">organisational mergers</field><field name="subject">employees psychology</field><field name="subject">consolidation and merger of corporations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070216.104601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and optimisation of the variable frequency microwave technique and its application to microfabrication</field><field name="creator">Antonio, Christian</field><field name="description">The benefits of microwave technology in materials processing is well documented and
researched. It offers many potential advantages over conventional processing such as
rapid heating, faster processing times and more consistent product quality. However the
actual implementation of this technology has been lacking and the benefits have gone
largely unrealised. This is due largely in part to the non-uniform heating obtained in
multimode cavities in conventional microwave processing. Recently, a new processing
method dubbed the Variable Frequency Microwave (VFM) Technique has been
developed to overcome the inherent problems associated with conventional microwave
processing. By sweeping through a bandwidth of frequencies, the limitations observed in
conventional processing, and specifically the problem of heat uniformity, are avoided.
With the increase in research activities in alternative processing methods for new and
current materials that will provide better product quality as well as time and cost savings,
the VFM technique has the potential to rejuvenate interest in microwave processing. This
thesis documents the research work undertaken on the VFM technique with emphasis on
its characterization, optimisation and implementation to suitable applications in particular
in the upcoming area of Microfabrication.
A commercial Variable Frequency Microwave with an operating bandwidth of 2.5-8.0
GHz was investigated through modelling and experimental work to determine the energy
distribution within a multimode cavity and to provide an insight of the mechanisms of the
method. Modelling was found to be an efficient and cost-effective tool to simulate VFM
and to examine the reported advantages of this new technique. Results obtained confirm
the superiority of the VFM method over the conventional fixed-frequency processing
showing a marked improvement in the heating uniformity achieved. Quantitative
analysis of the three major VFM parameters that influence heat uniformity - Sweep Rate,
Bandwidth and Central Frequency - indicate that although slight variation in heat
uniformity was observed when changing these parameters, these variations are only small
which implies that the VFM technique is quite insensitive to changes in the parameters
making it quite a robust system. An analytical model of the Variable Frequency
Microwave technique was developed and it was found that the heating uniformity could
be further optimised using a sweep rate that varies as the inverse of the frequency squared
(weighted-sweep).
In this study, VFM Technique was successfully extended to the Micro-Electro-
Mechanical Systems (MEMS) industry as an alternative method for the processing of a
polymer system - negative-tone SU8 photoresist - which is gaining widespread use in
Microfabrication. The VFM method was compared to conventional hotplate curing as
well as a new hybrid curing method introduced in this work and the product quality
assessed optically and by thermal analysis. Results from this work indicate that the
Variable Frequency Microwave technique is a viable alternative to the conventional cure
currently used in practice. With proper optimisation of the VFM parameters, VFM was
found to provide samples that are comparable or better than conventionally cured samples
in terms of properties and microstructure quality. Using the VFM method, enhancement
in cure rates and drying rates, which are described by others as microwave effects,
were observed and investigated. A significant increase on the degree of cure of up to
20% greater than conventional cure was observed when VFM was utilized and an
apparent enhancement in solvent evaporation in the thin SU8 films observed.
Experiments undertaken show that microwaves irradiation can enhance diffusion rates of
cyclopentanone in the SU8 system by approximately 75-100%. The findings signify that
SU8 curing at lower temperatures or rapid curing are possible and long drying times
could be reduced significantly thus alleviating many of the problems associated with
conventional thermal curing.
Outcomes of this study demonstrate the ability of the new VFM technique to provide
uniform heating which is essential for materials processing. Its application to the
emerging field of Microfabrication exhibits its unique advantages over conventional
curing methods and establishes itself to be a versatile and robust processing tool. The
experimental observations made under microwave irradiation are further proof of the
existence of specific microwave effects which is one of the most debatable topics in the
Microwave processing field. A mechanism based on the Cage Model by Zwanzig [1983]
was put forward to explain the increase in transport rates.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">variable frequency microwave</field><field name="subject">microwave processing</field><field name="subject">polymers</field><field name="subject">photoresist</field><field name="subject">SU8</field><field name="subject">mems</field><field name="subject">em modelling</field><field name="subject">microfabrication</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070220.122922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feedback and control of micro-pumps</field><field name="creator">Tomac, Tom</field><field name="description">This thesis constitutes the documentation for a Doctoral research program
undertaken at the Industrial Research Institute of Swinburne University of Technology
(IRIS) between 2001 and 2005. The focus of the research was an investigation of the
open- and closed-loop response of piezoelectric micro-pumps for micro-fluidic
applications, particularly for chemical and biomedical environments. Specifically, in
order to successfully integrate micro-devices into functional systems, it was important
to address issues of real-time performance monitoring and control. The research
addresses some of these problems in the context of a piezoelectric-driven micro-pump,
equipped with interferometric displacement feedback, which was used to measure the
dynamic displacement of the micro-pump actuator surface.
During the course of the research, both a discrete component and a fully integrated
(laboratory-on-a-board) test system were developed for open-loop characterization of
the micro-pump. The laboratory-on-a-board system was also used for closed-loop
control application. Measurements showed significant differences in actuator velocity,
displacement and settling time between different pumping media. In addition, transient
underdamped vibration of the actuator surface was observed during the rapid excursion
and recursion phases of the pump movement while pumping air. These non-contact
measurements could be used to determine the open-loop characteristics of a micropump
and provide information for design improvement or failure detection/analysis.
The technique could also be used to provide continuous measurement for adaptive
compensation, so that the pump performance criteria are always satisfied. To this end,
an automated interference fringe counting algorithm was developed, so that the steadystate
parameters could be mapped into the closed-loop control elements in real time.
The performance of this algorithm is discussed herein, together with the implications for
optimal control of the micro-pump, and eventual integration of the interferometer and
micro-pump systems. The research indicated that there were potential benefits in
closed-loop control of micro-pumps, particularly where failure detection was required
and for pumping of non-homogeneous media. The thesis also documents the relative
performance differences between open and closed-loop control in homogenous media.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mems</field><field name="subject">micro-pumps</field><field name="subject">feedback and control</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070220.130359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual space attention in three-dimensional space</field><field name="creator">Tucker, Andrew James</field><field name="description">Current models of visual spatial attention are based on the extent to which attention can
be allocated in 2-dimensional displays. The distribution of attention in 3-dimensional
space has received little consideration. A series of experiments were devised to explore
the apparent inconsistencies in the literature pertaining to the allocation of spatial
attention in the third dimension. A review of the literature attributed these
inconsistencies to differences and limitations in the various methodologies employed, in
addition to the use of differing attentional paradigms. An initial aim of this thesis was
to develop a highly controlled novel adaptation of the conventional robust covert
orienting of visual attention task (COVAT) in depth defined by either binocular
(stereoscopic) or monocular cues. The results indicated that attentional selection in the
COVAT is not allocated within a 3-dimensional representation of space. Consequently,
an alternative measure of spatial attention in depth, the overlay interference task, was
successfully validated in a different stereoscopic depth environment and then
manipulated to further examine the allocation of attention in depth. Findings from the
overlay interference experiments indicated that attentional selection is based on a
representation that includes depth information, but only when an additional feature can
aid 3D selection. Collectively, the results suggest a dissociation between two paradigms
that are both purported to be measures of spatial attention. There appears to be a further
dissociation between 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional attentional selection in both
paradigms for different reasons. These behavioural results, combined with recent
electrophysiological evidence suggest that the temporal constraints of the 3D COVAT
paradigm result in early selection based predominantly on retinotopic spatial
coordinates prior to the complete construction of a 3-dimensional representation. Task
requirements of the 3D overlay interference paradigm, on the other hand, while not
being restricted by temporal constraints, demand that attentional selection occurs later,
after the construction of a 3-dimensional representation, but only with the guidance of a
secondary feature. Regardless of whether attentional selection occurs early or late,
however, some component of selection appears to be based on viewer-centred spatial
coordinates.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">visual space attention</field><field name="subject">stereoscopic depth</field><field name="subject">monocular depth</field><field name="subject">covert orienting</field><field name="subject">three-dimensional spce</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070301.085637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A rationale-based model for architecture design reasoning</field><field name="creator">Tang, Antony Shui Sum</field><field name="description">Large systems often have a long life-span and their system and software architecture design comprise many intricately related elements. The verification and maintenance of these architecture designs require an understanding of how and why the system are constructed. Design rationale is the reasoning behind a design and it provides an explanation of the design. However, the reasoning is often undocumented or unstructured in practice. This causes difficulties in the understanding of the original design, and makes it hard to detect inconsistencies, omissions and conflicts without any explanations to the intricacies of the design. Research into design rationale in the past has focused on argumentation-based design deliberations. Argumentation-based design rationale models provide an explicit representation of design rationale. However, these methods are ineffective in communicating design reasoning in practice because they do not support tracing to design elements and requirements in an effective manner.
In this thesis, we firstly report a survey of practising architects to understand their
perception of the value of design rationale and how they use and document this knowledge.
From the survey, we have discovered that practitioners recognize the importance of documenting design rationale and frequently use them to reason about their design choices. However, they have indicated certain barriers to the use and documentation of design rationale. The results have indicated that there is no systematic approach to using and capturing design rationale in current architecture design practice. Using these findings, we address the issues of representing and applying architecture design rationale.
We have constructed a rationale-based architecture model to represent design rationale,
design objects and their relationships, which we call Architecture Rationale and
Element Linkage (AREL). AREL captures both qualitative and quantitative rationale for
architecture design. Quantitative rationale uses costs, benefits and risks to justify architecture
decisions. Qualitative rationale documents the issues, arguments, alternatives and
tradeoffs of a design decision. With the quantitative and qualitative rationale, the AREL
model provides reasoning support to explain why architecture elements exist and what
assumptions and constraints they depend on. Using a causal relationship in the AREL
model, architecture decisions and architecture elements are linked together to explain the reasoning of the architecture design. Architecture Rationalisation Method (ARM) is a
methodology that makes use of AREL to facilitate architecture design. ARM uses cost,
benefit and risk as fundamental elements to rank and compare alternative solutions in the decision making process.
Using the AREL model, we have proposed traceability and probabilistic techniques
based on Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) to support architecture understanding and
maintenance. These techniques can help to carry out change impact analysis and rootcause analysis. The traceability techniques comprise of forward, backward and evolution tracings. Architects can trace the architecture design to discover the change impacts by analysing the qualitative reasons and the relationships in the architecture design. We have integrated BBN to AREL to provide an additional method where probability is used to evaluate and reason about the change impacts in the architecture design. This integration provides quantifiable support to AREL to perform predictive, diagnostic and combined reasoning.
In order to align closely with industry practices, we have chosen to represent the
rationale-based architecture model in UML. In a case study, the AREL model is applied
retrospectively to a real-life bank payment systems to demonstrate its features and applications.
Practising architects who are experts in the electronic payment system domain
have been invited to evaluate the case study. They have found that AREL is useful in
helping them understand the system architecture when they compared AREL with traditional design specifications. They have commented that AREL can be useful to support the verification and maintenance of the architecture because architects do not need to reconstruct or second-guess the design reasoning.
We have implemented an AREL tool-set that is comprised of commercially available
and custom-developed programs. It enables the capture of architecture design and its
design rationale using a commercially available UML tool. It checks the well-formedness
of an AREL model. It integrates a commercially available BBN tool to reason about the
architecture design and to estimate its change impacts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">design rationale</field><field name="subject">software architecture</field><field name="subject">traceability</field><field name="subject">bayesian belief network</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070319.100952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The acute side effects of d-amphetamine and methamphetamine on simulated driving performance, cognitive functioning, brain activity, and the standardised field sobriety tests</field><field name="creator">Silber, Yvonne Beata</field><field name="description">Recently there has been an increase in awareness of the role of drugs other than alcohol in the causation of road accidents and deaths, with the most recent report indicating that 33% of all Victorian (Australia) road fatalities are drug (other than alcohol) related (TAC,
2006). Currently in Victoria, one of the classes of drugs reported to be of most concern is
the amphetamines. The epidemiological driving literature highlights a possible association between amphetamine use and road crashes. However, since the cognitive research generally indicates cognitive enhancing properties following amphetamine consumption, it remains unclear how amphetamines may be related to adverse driving. The present thesis was designed to explore this issue.
In response to the increasing number of drug-related road fatalities, the Standardised Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs), designed and validated for the detection and assessment of
impairment associated with alcohol intoxication, are currently being employed by the
Victoria Police (Australia) for the identification of driving impairment associated with
drugs other than alcohol. The present thesis was designed to evaluate whether the SFSTs
are a sensitive measure for identifying impairment associated with a single acute
therapeutic amphetamine dose. Furthermore, the accuracy of using the SFSTs to detect
driving impairment associated with these amphetamine doses was also evaluated.
The present thesis examined the effects of a single acute therapeutic dose of various
amphetamine preparations, on simulated driving performance, driving-related cognitive
processes (assessed using standard cognitive tasks and the electroencephalogram [EEG]),
and performance on the SFSTs, in healthy, stimulant-using, non-fatigued adults. The
present thesis consisted of five separate experiments. The first three experiments examined the effects of d-amphetamine, d,l-methamphetamine, and d-methamphetamine, on simulated driving performance, driving-related cognitive processes, and performance on the SFSTs. Experiment 4 and Experiment 5 assessed the effects of d-amphetamine and dmethamphetamine on visual and auditory cognitive processes using the EEG. These forms of amphetamines were selected as they are commonly used recreationally by young adult drivers, and occupationally by truck drivers.
Experiment 1, Experiment 2, and Experiment 3 employed a repeated-measures, counterbalanced, double blind, placebo-controlled design. In each experiment, twenty different (i.e. 60 participants in total) healthy volunteers (10 males and 10 females) completed two treatment conditions i) placebo and ii) 0.42mg/kg amphetamine (~30mg). Driving performance was assessed using a driving simulator task, which consisted of four driving tasks; &#65533;freeway traffic driving&#65533; and &#65533;city traffic driving&#65533; in both day and night conditions.
Cognitive performance was assessed using a range of computer and pen and paper tasks
designed to assess attention, psychomotor performance, and perceptual speed. Specifically, the tasks were: the Digit Span Test; a Digit Vigilance task; a Movement Estimation Task; the Digit Symbol Substitution Test; a Tracking Task; the Trail-Making Test; and the Inspection Time task. SFSTs performance was assessed using the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test, the Walk and Turn (WAT) test, and the One Leg Stand (OLS) test. Three blood and saliva samples were obtained throughout all experimental sessions (120, 170, and 240 minutes after drug administration).
The results indicated that 0.42mg/kg d-amphetamine significantly impaired simulated
driving performance, in recreational stimulant users, 2-3 hours post-drug administration,
when mean blood amphetamine concentrations were approximately 90ng/mL. No
significant driving decrements were observed following d,l-methamphetamine or dmethamphetamine, when methamphetamine blood concentrations were 90ng/mL and
70ng/mL, respectively. There were only few driving behaviours that were found to be
significantly reduced with d-amphetamine, such as reductions in signalling adherence and
driving too fast for the traffic conditions. However, during all three amphetamine
conditions, drivers travelled at a slower speed on the freeway at the time that an emergency situation occurred, relative to the placebo condition. It was argued that either this may result from more cautious driving, or that the reduction in speed acted as a compensatory mechanism to permit drivers to attend to other aspects of driving. Overall, the present results indicate that a therapeutic dose of amphetamine does not produce considerable impairment to driving, as only minimal amphetamine effects were observed on driving performance.
In terms of cognitive performance, the results indicated that a therapeutic dose of various
amphetamines has minimal effect on driving-related cognitive functioning, with some
significant improvements noted in aspects of attention, psychomotor functioning and
perceptual speed. This is consistent with the failure to identify significant driving
impairments, described above, following a similar dose. However, the ability to perceive
and predict motion and estimate &#65533;time to contact&#65533;, assessed using a movement estimation
task, was affected following d-amphetamine and d-methamphetamine consumption.
In terms of performance on the SFSTs, the present thesis demonstrated that following the
administration of low-level d-amphetamine, d,l-methamphetamine, and dmethamphetamine, performance on the SFSTs was not impaired. Using the SFSTs,
impairment associated with low dose d-amphetamine was identified in only 5% of cases, dmethamphetamine in 5% of cases, and d,l-methamphetamine in 0% of cases. These
findings indicate that the degree of impairment produced with the low amphetamine dosing conditions was below the threshold of sensitivity of the SFSTs. However, as significant impairments in driving were not observed with amphetamines, the present SFSTs findings highlight that these tests are unlikely to produce false positive results during police drug evaluation procedures for amphetamine-related impairments.
Experiment 4 and Experiment 5 similarly employed a repeated-measures, counterbalanced, double blind, placebo-controlled design. In each experiment, twenty healthy volunteers (10 males and 10 females) completed two treatment conditions i) placebo and ii) 0.42mg/kg amphetamine (~30mg). Tasks designed to assess visual and auditory cognitive functions relevant to driving were administered. Specifically, these processes were: divergent visual system pathways (magnocellular and parvocellular pathways); aspects of visual field processing (central and peripheral visual fields); mismatch negativity (MMN); prepulse inhibition (PPI); selective attention; resource allocation; and speed of processing. Two blood and saliva samples were obtained throughout all experimental session (120 and 200 minutes after drug administration).
d-amphetamine and d-methamphetamine generally improved cognitive functioning, as
assessed with visual and auditory ERP indices. Specifically, the results demonstrated that a low-level acute dose of d-amphetamine and d-methamphetamine improved early
processing of visual information (indexed by improvements to the P100 component for the magnocellular and parvocellular visual pathways). In addition, d-methamphetamine
improved the speed at which visual information was evaluated and processed (indexed by
decreases in P300 latency), which was consistent with d-methamphetamine-related
improvements in reaction time. 
There was a trend for d-amphetamine to improve the speed
that changes in auditory stimulation were automatically detected (indexed by decreases in
MMN latency). In addition, d-methamphetamine improved the ability to automatically
&#65533;screen out&#65533; irrelevant and intrusive auditory information (indexed by increases in PPI of
the startle response). d-amphetamine was found to improve the speed at which auditory
information was evaluated and processed (indexed by decreases in P300 latency), which
was substantiated with corresponding improvements in reaction time and accuracy.
Although amphetamines were generally shown to enhance ERP indices, a trend was found for d-amphetamine to differentially affect different regions of the visual field, in terms of selective attention. Specifically, there was a trend-level indication that d-amphetamine improved indices of selective attention (denoted by increases in N200 amplitude) for information presented centrally, but impaired indices of selective attention (denoted by decreases in N200 amplitude) for information presented in the periphery. Although impairments to the peripheral visual field were not similarly observed with dmethamphetamine, decrements to indices of selective attention (denoted by decreases in
N200 amplitude) were also found with d-methamphetamine during the auditory oddball
task. In terms of driving, these results suggest that drivers dosed with low-level
amphetamine may not selectively attend to and discriminate changes within the traffic
environment, although further research is required to confirm this.
In conclusion, the present thesis has demonstrated that a single acute therapeutic dose of
amphetamine produces minimal and inconsistent effects to driving. However, some
(inconsistent) evidence was found that suggests that there may be mild impairments such
as decreased ability to perceive and predict motion, tunnel vision effects, and decrements
to selective attention. In addition, the present thesis highlights that at therapeutic doses,
amphetamines do not impair SFSTs performance, which is in accordance with the failure
to identify substantive amphetamine-related decrements to driving and cognitive
functioning observed in the present thesis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amphetamine</field><field name="subject">driving</field><field name="subject">eeg</field><field name="subject">sfsts</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070319.105603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role oriented adaptive design</field><field name="creator">Colman, Alan Wesley</field><field name="description">Software systems are becoming inexorably more open, distributed, pervasive, mobile and
connected. This thesis addresses the problem of how to build adaptive software systems.
These systems need to reliably achieve system-level goals in volatile environments, where
the system itself may be built from components of uncertain behaviour, and where the
requirements for the software system may be changing. This thesis adopts the systemtheoretic
concept of ontogenic adaptation from biology, and applies it to software
architecture. Ontogenic adaptation is the ability of an individual system to maintain its
organisational integrity by reconfiguring and regulating itself. A number of approaches to
adaptive software architecture have been recently proposed that, to varying degrees, enable
limited adaptive behaviour and reconfiguration, but none possess all the properties needed
for ontogenic adaptation. We introduce a meta-model and framework called Role Oriented
Adaptive Design (ROAD) that is consistent with the concept of maintaining organisational
integrity through ontogenic adaptation.
The ROAD meta-model defines software applications as networks of functional roles
which are executed by players (objects, components, services, agents, people, or rolecomposites).
These flexible organisational structures are adaptive because the relationships
(contracts) between roles, and the bindings between roles and players, can be regulated and
reconfigured at run-time. Such flexible organisational role-structures are encapsulated into
composites each with its own organiser. Because self-managed composites are themselves
role-players, these composites can be distributed and recursively composed. The organisers
of the composites form a management system over which requirements and performance
data pass. Rather than being monolithic constructions, ROAD software applications are
dynamic, self-managed compositions of loosely-coupled, and potentially, distributed
entities.
The concepts in the ROAD meta-model have been implemented in a programming
framework which can be extended by the application programmer to create adaptive
applications. Central to this framework are dynamic contracts. These contracts define the
role structure, control interactions between the role instances, and measure the performance
of those interactions. Adaptivity is achieved by monitoring and manipulating these
contracts, along with the role-player bindings. Contracts have been implemented using the
mechanism of &#65533;association aspects&#65533;.
The applicability of the ROAD framework to the domain of Service-Oriented
Computing is demonstrated. The framework is further evaluated in terms of its ability to
express the concept of ontogenic adaptation and also in terms of the overhead its runtime
infrastructure imposes on interactions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adaptive software architecture</field><field name="subject">role modelling</field><field name="subject">contracts</field><field name="subject">software organisations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070320.110756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A high performance ATM switch architecture</field><field name="creator">Chen, Hong Xu</field><field name="description">ATM is based on the efforts of the ITU-T Broadband Integrated Services Digital
Network (B-ISDN) standard. It was originally conceived as a high-speed transfer
technology for voice, video, and data over public networks. The ATM Forum has
broadened the ITU-T&#65533;s vision of ATM for extended use over public and private networks,
multi-protocol support and mobile ATM. There are also some ATM applications in High
Performance Computing (HPC).
ATM is a packet switching technique based on a virtual circuit mechanism. Data
flows are statistically multiplexed and communication resources are dynamically shared.
Therefore the high performance ATM switch is essential for quality of services (QoS).
This thesis introduces typical ATM switch architecture design and analyses
design problems. The research objective is to propose a switch architecture design that
can solve or improve those existing problems to achieve a superior performance. The
research goal is an integrated ATM switch architecture that will handle both unicast and
multicast packets. Unlike the usual design for the multicast ATM switch which
concentrates on a cell copy network with a unicast switching network, the proposed
switch architecture processes the network packets in a single switching block, and allows
unicast and multicast packets to co-exist without competing. The switch design has a
simple topology and operation principle and is easy to implement. Furthermore, no copy
network is required. Three major components are proposed to form the core of the new
switch architecture: the parallel buffering strategy for improved buffer performance, the
fast table lookup algorithm for packet duplication and routing, and the relay ring
controller for solving the contention problem associated with multiple packets destined
for the same output port.
A mathematical model is presented and its numerical results are analysed. In
addition, the simulation algorithms for the proposed switching design are presented and
compared against the switching design with input and output buffering strategies. The
simulation results are also compared and analysed against the numerical results.
A multicast traffic model is also presented. Its performance calculation for the
proposed switch is achieved through simulation. Performance analysis is compared
against the output buffering switch under the same multicast traffic model.
The performance analysis shows that the proposed switch architecture achieves
high throughput with low cell loss rate and low time delay. Its performance can be as
good as the output buffering strategy or better. Therefore the proposed switch design has
solved the problems associated with input and output buffering.
This thesis also analyses the complexity of the proposed switch architecture and
suggests a topology to build a large scale ATM switch. The suitability and feasibility for
production implementation are also addressed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">ATM switch architecture</field><field name="subject">broadband communication</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070405.172354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental study of zeotropic refrigerant mixture HFC-407C as a replacement for HCFC-22 in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems</field><field name="creator">Mirza-Tolouee, Changiz M.</field><field name="description">HCFC-22 is the world&#65533;s most widely used refrigerant. It serves in both residential and
commercial applications, from small window units to large water chillers, and
everything in between. Its particular combination of efficiency, capacity and pressure
has made it a popular choice for equipment designers. Nevertheless, it does have some
ODP, so international law set forth in the Montreal Protocol and its Copenhagen and
Vienna amendments have put HCFC-22 on a phase out schedule. In developed
countries, production of HCFC-22 will end no later than the year 2030.
Zeotropic blend HFC-407C has been established as a drop-in alternative for HCFC-22
in the industry due to their zero Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) and similarities in
thermodynamic properties and performance. However, when a system is charged with a
zeotropic mixture, it raises concerns about temperature glide at two-phase state,
differential oil solubility and internal composition shift.
Not enough research has been done to cover all aspects of alternative refrigerants
applications in the systems. This research intended to explore behavior of this
alternative refrigerants compare to HCFC-22 and challenges facing the industry in
design, operation service and maintenance of these equipments.
The purpose of this research is to investigate behavior of R407C refrigerant in chiller
systems. This includes performance and efficiency variations when it replaces R22 in an
existing system as well as challenges involved maintaining the system charged with
R407C. It is a common practice in the industry these days to evacuate and completely
recharge when part of the new refrigerant blend was leaked from the system. This has
proved to be extremely costly exercise with grave environmental ramifications.
This research is intended to address challenges faced in the real world and practical
terms.
Theoretical and experimental approaches used as a methodology in this work. The
system mathematically modeled to predict detailed system performance and effect of
the leak at various conditions. To make this feasible and accurate enough, two separate
approaches made, first system performance for pure R22 and R407C, and second
system subjected to range of leak fractions. The earlier model was relatively straight
forward when compared to the latter. Modeling a system charged with R407C ternary
mixture and subjected to range of leaks posed enormous challenges.
A sophisticated experimental test apparatus was also designed and built. Comprehensive
and detailed tests at various conditions were conducted with special attention on
instrumental accuracy and correct methodology.
The first part has been successfully modeled and predicted all the factors and
performance with excellent accuracy when compared to the test results. In these
approaches pure refrigerants R22 and R407C were used and simulated the system
behavior at range of conditions.
However, the second part was the most challenging ever. Comprehensive leak process
simulations produced trends of R32/R125/R134a composition change as function of rate
of leak. Starting from this point, equations have been created to represent the
composition change as function of percentage of the leak. The system thermodynamic
cycle was also modeled to calculate capacity, power input and COP at the range of the
conditions. Despite many affecting parameters and complexity of the model, the
mathematical model successfully predicted the test outcome with a very reasonable
accuracy, averaging around 3% with some times reaching to 5 to 6%.
On the experimental stage the system charged with the new HFC-407C was deliberately
subjected to refrigerant leak at various leak stages. The aim was to objectively
determine to what extend the gas leak can be still acceptable without going through the
expensive complete gas charge. The effect of leak was tested and verified at 10% steps,
from 10% up to 50% mass fraction for the total charge.
It has been observed that at the leaks beyond 30%, the adverse effect on the capacity
becomes more significant, from 8 to about 15% decrease. While the power input
decreased at slower pace, from 3% up to about 8% depending on the test conditions.
This translated to COP decrease ranging from 4 to about 7%. This capacity loss and
efficiency decrease are significant figures which suggests that the system, here chiller,
can not be allowed to degrade the performance to that extend and still continue
operating.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alternative refrigerant</field><field name="subject">HFC-407C</field><field name="subject">HCFC-22 replacement</field><field name="subject">system leak</field><field name="subject">chiller systems</field><field name="subject">zeotropic refrigerant</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070416.141307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of obesity and binge eating behaviour in preadolescent Australian school children</field><field name="creator">Karantzas, Kellie</field><field name="description">Childhood overweight and obesity is a significant and increasing health problem both nationally and globally. Yet few interventions for preventing obesity have been successful, particularly in the long-term, suggesting that important factors are being overlooked. The aims of this thesis were to investigate (a) the prevalence of childhood overweight, obesity, and binge eating; and (b) the relationships between body weight, binge eating behaviour, and a set of physical, psychological, and psychosocial variables including parent body size, body dissatisfaction, size-related teasing experiences, internalisation of sociocultural messages, depression, dieting attitudes and behaviour, and emotional eating. 
Participants were 569 grade five and six primary school children (272 boys and 297 girls) from Catholic and Government schools across metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Almost 25% of participants were classified as overweight or obese. Thirteen percent of participants reported engaging in overeating (with or without loss of control), 14% reported loss of control (with or without overeating), and 6% reported engaging in binge eating (overeating and loss of control). 
Structural equation modelling analyses found that body weight and binge eating were indirectly related. Body weight was directly and positively associated with parent body size, size-related teasing experiences, body dissatisfaction, and internalisation of sociocultural messages, negatively associated with emotional eating, and indirectly associated with depression, and dieting attitudes and behaviour. Binge eating was directly and positively related to parent body size, emotional eating, depression, and body dissatisfaction, while indirect associations were found with size-related teasing experiences, internalisation of sociocultural messages, and dieting attitudes and behaviour. A direct relationship between body dissatisfaction and loss of control was also found. Some gender differences were detected. 
Multivariate analysis of variance also revealed that binge eaters scored significantly higher on measures of depression, size-related teasing experiences, internalisation of sociocultural messages, and angry and worried related emotional eating than non-binge eaters. Differences were also found for participants reporting the presence or absence of overeating (regardless of loss of control) and loss of control (regardless of overeating). 
Overall, the study demonstrated that psychological and psychosocial factors have a significant association with both weight and binge eating behaviour in a non-clinical sample of preadolescent Australian school children. As such, future intervention programs may benefit by addressing these factors. In addition, these results support the idea of working toward the prevention of obesity and eating disorders simultaneously in children, and of extending research in this area to examine causality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obesity in children</field><field name="subject">body weight</field><field name="subject">binge eating</field><field name="subject">eating behaviour</field><field name="subject">psychological factors</field><field name="subject">psychsocial factors</field><field name="subject">preadolescent</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070416.150247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of gas turbine combustor fluid mechanics on smoke emissions</field><field name="creator">Skidmore, F.

It asks the key question &#65533;What does it take?&#65533; in seeking to identify the organisational and managerial capabilities that underpin successful entrepreneurial outcomes with a view to developing a model that can assist senior university executives in their managerial and leadership practice.

The study is undertaken in an interpretive, qualitative research framework where an initial model based on a literature synthesis, using the work of Clark as a starting point, is presented to a group of participants. All are either present or recent vice-chancellors, higher education industry experts and bureaucrats, or are senior technology transfer managers concerned with direct entrepreneurial efforts in larger universities. In two iterations, the participants are engaged in dialogue about the model, refining and commenting on it until their views are incorporated and it more closely approximates their own mental models for the practice of entrepreneurship in the university. 

Their comments about related issues of government policy, current national and international trends, their respective university strategies and concerns are also incorporated to add rich meaning to their views on the model itself.

The study concludes that there are five clusters of capabilities involved in building an entrepreneurial university in the Australian setting. They are labelled Context, Strategy, People, Enabling Mechanisms and Culture and Internal Politics in this study. There is some overlap with those elements Clark originally identified but also some notable additional emphasis and detail added. In this study, the capability clusters related to relationship with environment and Context and that relating to Strategy and strategic leadership in general are found to be more important than Clark indicated, more crucial in the present Australian context and generally more underdeveloped in Australia than the current circumstances would indicate is necessary.

It is concluded that where entrepreneurship is handled as a marginal, optional, or half-hearted pursuit, and the concept not fully embraced, it is likely to result in haphazard outcomes, not always enhancing or progressing the institution in its desired direction. In contrast, successful entrepreneurship in and by Australian universities essentially requires greater emphasis on the capabilities of strategic management and plans that place entrepreneurship centrally in an integrated strategic entrepreneurship framework.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">capability</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070423.094131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Micro-net the parallel path artificial neuron</field><field name="creator">Murray, Andrew Gerard William</field><field name="description">A feed forward architecture is suggested that increases the complexity of conventional neural
network components through the implementation of a more complex scheme of interconnection.
This is done with a view to increasing the range of application of the feed forward paradigm.
The uniqueness of this new network design is illustrated by developing an extended taxonomy
of accepted published constructs specific and similar to the higher order, product kernel
approximations achievable using "parallel paths". Network topologies from this taxonomy are
then compared to each other and the architectures containing parallel paths. In attempting this
comparison, the context of the term "network topology" is reconsidered.
The output of "channels" in these parallel paths are the products of a conventional connection
as observed facilitating interconnection between two layers in a multilayered perceptron and the
output of a network processing unit, a "control element", that can assume the identity of a
number of pre-existing processing paradigms.
The inherent property of universal approximation is tested by existence proof and the method
found to be inconclusive. In so doing an argument is suggested to indicate that the parametric
nature of the functions as determined by conditions upon initialization may only lead to
conditional approximations. The property of universal approximation is neither, confirmed or
denied. Universal approximation cannot be conclusively determined by the application of Stone
Weierstrass Theorem, as adopted from real analysis.
This novel implementation requires modifications to component concepts and the training
algorithm. The inspiration for these modifications is related back to previously published work
that also provides the basis of "proof of concept".
By achieving proof of concept the appropriateness of considering network topology without
assessing the impact of the method of training on this topology is considered and discussed in
some detail.

which aims to support large-scale sophisticated scientific or business processes in a
variety of complex e-science or e-business applications such as climate modelling,
disaster recovery, medical surgery, high energy physics, international stock market
modelling and so on. Such sophisticated processes often contain hundreds of
thousands of computation or data intensive activities and take a long time to
complete. In reality, they are normally time constrained. Correspondingly, temporal
constraints are enforced when they are modelled or redesigned as grid workflow
specifications at build-time. The main types of temporal constraints include upper
bound, lower bound and fixed-time. Then, temporal verification would be conducted
so that we can identify any temporal violations and handle them in time.
Conventional temporal verification research and practice have presented some
basic concepts and approaches. However, they have not paid sufficient attention to
overall temporal verification effectiveness and efficiency. In the context of grid
economy, any resources for executing grid workflows must be paid. Therefore, more
resources should be mainly used for execution of grid workflow itself rather than for
temporal verification. Poor temporal verification effectiveness or efficiency would
cause more resources diverted to temporal verification. Hence, temporal verification
effectiveness and efficiency become a prominent issue and deserve an in-depth
investigation.
This thesis systematically investigates the limitations of conventional temporal
verification in terms of temporal verification effectiveness and efficiency. The
detailed analysis of temporal verification effectiveness and efficiency is conducted
for each step of a temporal verification cycle. There are four steps in total: Step 1 -
defining temporal consistency; Step 2 - assigning temporal constraints; Step 3 -
selecting appropriate checkpoints; and Step 4 - verifying temporal constraints.
Based on the investigation and analysis, we propose some new concepts and develop
a set of innovative methods and algorithms towards more effective and efficient
temporal verification. Comparisons, quantitative evaluations and/or mathematical
proofs are also presented at each step of the temporal verification cycle. These
demonstrate that our new concepts, innovative methods and algorithms can
significantly improve overall temporal verification effectiveness and efficiency.
Specifically, in Step 1, we analyse the limitations of two temporal consistency
states which are defined by conventional verification work. After, we propose four
new states towards better temporal verification effectiveness. In Step 2, we analyse
the necessity of a number of temporal constraints in terms of temporal verification
effectiveness. Then we design a novel algorithm for assigning a series of finegrained
temporal constraints within a few user-set coarse-grained ones. In Step 3, we
discuss the problem of existing representative checkpoint selection strategies in
terms of temporal verification effectiveness and efficiency. The problem is that they
often ignore some necessary checkpoints and/or select some unnecessary ones. To
solve this problem, we develop an innovative strategy and corresponding algorithms
which only select sufficient and necessary checkpoints. In Step 4, we investigate a
phenomenon which is ignored by existing temporal verification work, i.e. temporal
dependency. Temporal dependency means temporal constraints are often dependent
on each other in terms of their verification. We analyse its impact on overall
temporal verification effectiveness and efficiency. Based on this, we develop some
novel temporal verification algorithms which can significantly improve overall
temporal verification effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, we present an extension
to our research about handling temporal verification results since these verification
results are based on our four new temporal consistency states.
The major contributions of this research are that we have provided a set of new
concepts, innovative methods and algorithms for temporal verification in grid
workflow systems. With these, we can significantly improve overall temporal
verification effectiveness and efficiency. This would eventually improve the overall
performance and usability of grid workflow systems because temporal verification
can be viewed as a service or function of grid workflow systems. Consequently, by
deploying the new concepts, innovative methods and algorithms, grid workflow
systems would be able to better support large-scale sophisticated scientific and
business processes in complex e-science and e-business applications in the context
of grid economy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grid workflow</field><field name="subject">temporal verification</field><field name="subject">temporal constraints</field><field name="subject">temporal verification effectiveness</field><field name="subject">temporal verification</field><field name="subject">Computational grids (Computer systems)</field><field name="subject">Computer software verification</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070424.112326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of self aspects, sources of workplace satisfaction and gender on organisational commitment an integrated model</field><field name="creator">Cahill, Francis Joseph</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between self-aspects,
sources of workplace satisfaction and types of organisational commitment. This study
tested three expectations. The first was that employees with strongly developed
relational self-aspects who find satisfaction in workplace relationships with their direct
managers and colleagues were likely to experience affective committed towards their
organisation. The second was that employees with strongly developed individual selfaspects
who find satisfaction in the job itself were likely to experience continuance
commitment towards their organisation. The third was that employees with strongly
developed collective self-aspects who find satisfaction in the organisation as well as its
senior management were likely to experience normative committed towards their
organisation. To test these hypotheses, three empirical studies were conducted.
In Study 1 respondents (N = 140) were drawn from a large aged care nursing
facility. Using separate regression analyses, support was found for the expectation that
relational self-aspects would predict satisfaction with colleague relationships and that
satisfaction with colleague and manager relationships would predict affective
commitment. Support was also found for the expectation that collective self-aspects
would predict satisfaction with the organisation and its senior management, however
only satisfaction with the organisation was found to predict normative commitment. The
expected relationship between individual self-aspects, job satisfaction and continuance
commitment was not supported. It was argued that the strong relational nature of the
sample and the high percentage (87%) of females within the sample may have
influenced the results.
Study 2 was designed to reconfirm the expected relationship between sources of
workplace satisfaction and types of organisational commitment using a broader sample.
Respondents (N = 146; females =86, males = 60) were drawn from four sources; a
credit co-op, an adventure based training organisation, a commercial cleaning
organisation, and a Graduate School of Business. As expected, satisfaction with
colleague relationships was a significant predictor of affective commitment, while a
non-significant trend was observed for satisfaction with manager relationships. Some
support was found for the expectation that job satisfaction would be a significant
predictor of continuance commitment through an observed non-significant trend.
Satisfaction with the organisation was a significant predictor of normative commitment,
while satisfaction with senior management was not. The influence of gender on these
results were also examined and discussed.
The purpose of Study 3 was to introduce a newly developed work specific selfaspects
scale and test the integrated model that examined the relationship between three
types of self-aspects, three sources of workplace satisfaction on three types of
organisational commitment. The influence of gender was also examined and discussed.
Respondents (N= 119) were drawn from an Australian financial institution. Using
standard regression analysis to test the model, it was found that collective work selfaspects
together with satisfaction with colleague and manager relationships were the
only predictors of affective commitment, while collective work self-aspects together
with satisfaction with the organisation were the only predictors of normative
commitment. No support was found for the expectation that individual self-aspects
together with job satisfaction would significantly predict continuous commitment.
The results of this research provided some support for the view that the strength
of an employee's self-aspects may determine the type of workplace experiences they are
likely to find satisfying. Furthermore, these sources of workplace satisfaction are likely
to lead to different forms of organisational commitment. It was argued that the results
observed across the three studies may have been influenced by organisational context.
It was suggested that further research should sample a broader range of organisations in
order to test the validity of the integrated model.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self-aspects</field><field name="subject">workplace satisfaction</field><field name="subject">organisational commitment</field><field name="subject">Sex role in the work environment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070424.155259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artificial intelligence architectures for classifying conjoined data</field><field name="creator">Pierrot, Henri Jan</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the development of novel methods of classifying data

The key to designing and utilising semiconductor quantum structures is a physical understanding
of the detailed excitation, transport and energy relaxation processes. Thus the nonequilibrium
dynamics of semiconductor quantum structures have attracted extensive attention in recent years.
Ultrafast spectroscopy has proven to be a versatile and powerful tool for investigating transient
phenomena related to the relaxation and transport dynamics in semiconductors.
In this thesis, we report investigations into the electronic and optical properties of various
semiconductor quantum systems using a variety of ultrafast techniques, including up-conversion
photoluminescence, pump-probe, photon echoes and four-wave mixing. The semiconductor
quantum systems studied include ZnO/ZnMgO multiple quantum wells with oxygen ion
implantation, InGaAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots with different doping, InGaAs/InP
quantum wells with proton implantation, and silicon quantum dots. The spectra of these
semiconductor nanostructures range from the ultraviolet region, through the visible, to the
infrared. In the UV region we investigate excitons, biexcitons and oxygen implantation effects in
ZnO/ZnMgO multi-quantum wells using four-wave mixing, pump-probe and photoluminescence
techniques. Using time-resolved up-conversion photoluminescence, we investigate the relaxation
dynamics and state filling effect in InGaAs self-assembled quantum dots with different doping,
and the implantation effect in InGaAs/InP quantum wells. Finally, we study the optical properties
of silicon quantum dots using time-resolved photoluminescence and photon echo spectroscopy on
various time scales, ranging from microseconds to femtoseconds.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ultrafast spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">ZnO quantum wells</field><field name="subject">InGaAs quantum dots</field><field name="subject">silicon quantum dots</field><field name="subject">up-conversion photoluminescence</field><field name="subject">pump-probe</field><field name="subject">four wave mixing</field><field name="subject">transient grating</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070426.110438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic alliance as an entrepreneurial stimulus for learning in mature stage organizations : a case study of financial services organizations entering into cross industry agreement strategic alliances</field><field name="creator">Rees, Alan Norman</field><field name="description">Sustained success for an organization is based upon its ability to constantly realign with opportunities that emerge within their markets. Thus, organizations must continually evolve as markets evolve. 
This thesis examined how mature stage organizations within the financial services industry can adopt entrepreneurial approaches to learn, evolve and improve their competitiveness. Despite the rate of technological change, globalization, and convergence of industries that has occurred in the last decade, there is no clear model to support the adoption of entrepreneurial activities within mature stage organizations. Adopting an exploratory qualitative case study approach, the researcher interviewed informants with experience in the financial services industry in Australia, Europe, North and South Asia, and the United States of America to explore the research question: How do mature stage organizations integrate strategic alliances as an entrepreneurial approach and capitalize on learning in response to evolving markets? 
Interviewing key informants within the financial services industry, the study confirmed a range of means of conceptualizing, introducing, and managing new business initiatives through strategic alliances. These findings were synthesized into a hypothetical organization in which, it became evident, the more entrepreneurial and innovative the organization became, the more capable it was of sourcing and responding to new opportunities within existing and related markets. 
The study confirmed the need in strategic alliances for shared vision, strong leadership, effective communication of the organization's direction and strategy, a culture that embraces flexibility, business competence, a commitment to respect and manage differences between organizations, an ability to work collaboratively, and a willingness to upgrade or replace business processes and technologies to support innovation. 
The study sought to provide an understanding of how entrepreneurial approaches can remain fluid rather than become static, and how they can be preserved within mature organizations. The importance of leadership, commonality of vision, collaboration, communication, integration of business structures and processes, and willingness to learn from each other began to emerge as central issues from the initial interviews. Consequently, a second research question was added: How do partnering organizations operating in the mature stage of a corporate life cycle within the construct of a cross industry agreement strategic alliance adopt an entrepreneurial approach and mutually learn to recast the direction of their relationship? 
The study confirmed that organizations should develop and support a culture that embraces learning, flexibility and change. Entrepreneurial organizations require vision, leadership, business structures, processes, and competencies to support innovation. 
This research adds to the field by establishing that innovation is embedded in the ability of partnering organizations to learn continuously and collaboratively. In doing so, they become more capable of realigning with changing markets and creating and capitalizing on new markets. The research concludes that less hierarchical organizational structures within partnering organizations support strategic alliances and promote the ability of organizations to learn how to cooperate, collaborate, and grow individually and mutually together.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic alliance</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurial approach</field><field name="subject">organizational learning</field><field name="subject">mature stage organizations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070424.180436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fibres from recycled post consumer PET/nylon 6 blends</field><field name="creator">Kegel, Mark Steven</field><field name="description">The objective of this project was to develop blends based upon post consumer RPET and N6, and to evaluate the suitability of these blends to form fibres for the end use in  carpet fibre.
In the work carried out it was found it is possible to spin RPET/N6 biconstituent fibres over a wide range of blend ratios. All the blends studied have diminished physical properties when compared to those of pure RPET and N6. The processability of these blends also deteriorated due to the large increases in normal forces which manifests in extrusion equipment as die swell that often results in melt fracture.

It has been shown that the morphology of the fibre controls the degree of decay in properties and die swell at the spinnerette. The blends that are rich in one phase, with the secondary phase distributed as elongated fibrils have shown better physical performance and improved processing compared to the blends 70/30 &#65533; 30/70, which have poorer properties and increased die swell due to there co-continuous morphology. In quiescent studies, the physical properties of the blends have had little deviation from those predicted using a rule of mixtures line. In and around the 50% RPET blend, die swell was observed to be extreme and this makes fibre spinning difficult. It was found that this was caused by a loss in viscosity in the blends and a general increase in normal forces in response to applied shear. The die swell phenomenon is a rheological characteristic of the blends, which was inevitably caused by internal capillary flow of one component in the other.

IR spectroscopy has shown that there is little to no in-situ compatibilisation occurring during simple melt processing. However, it was found that significant interfacial compatibilisation could be achieved through solid stating N6/RPET blends. The FTIR spectra for solid state blends in figure 4.51 has shown absorbency in the 3300 cm-1 region after all free N6 was removed. This indicates that in-situ compatibilisation has occurred between the phases in the solid stating process and it is a time dependent reaction.

The Burgers and Koltunov models can be used to predict the creep behaviour of the fibre blends studied. The Burgers model provides greater accuracy for longer-term exposure to stress.

From the thermal results, the solid stating process significantly affects the melting and crystallisation out of the melt and the ultimate level of crystallinity. The contribution of the copolymer in these changes appears to be small. The physical strength of the fibres made on the laboratory line was only marginally lower than those made on a factory line. The morphology of the mid-range blends is co-continuous and that of the N6 and RPET rich blends is dispersed droplet morphology.

Based on the finding, a N6 rich blends and in particular the 10% RPET blend is the most suitable for further commercial development as its processing, physical performance and post spinning processing closely resemble the pure N6 currently in use. It has provided performance and consistency throughout the processing and testing we have conducted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polymer blends</field><field name="subject">nylon 6</field><field name="subject">RPET</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070606.111448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantification, characterisation and impact evaluation of mobile IPv6 hand off times</field><field name="creator">Banh, Mai Thi Quynh</field><field name="description">There is a growing range of IP-based data and voice applications using mobile devices (e.g. 3rd ,
4th generation mobile phones and PDAs) and new access technologies (e.g. Bluetooth, 802.11,
GPRS, ADSL). This growth is driving a desire to support mobility at the IP level &#65533; in other
words, allowing an IP host to keep on communicating with other hosts while roaming between
different IP subnetworks.
Mobile IPv6 allows hosts to move their physical and topological attachment points around
an IPv6 network while retaining connectivity through a single, well-known Home Address.
Although Mobile IPv6 has been the subject of simulation studies, the real-world dynamic
behavior of Mobile IPv6 is only gradually being experimentally characterised and analysed.
This thesis reviews the use of Mobile IPv6 to support mobility between independent
802.11b-attached IPv6 subnets, and experimentally measures and critically evaluates how long
an end to end IP path is disrupted when a Mobile IPv6 node shifts from one subnetwork to
another (handoff time). The thesis describes the development of an experimental testbed
suitable for gathering real-world Mobile IPv6 handoff data using publicly available, standards compliant
implementations of Mobile IPv6. (An open-source Mobile IPv6 stack (the KAME
release under FreeBSD) was deployed).
The component of handoff time due to 802.11b link layer handoff is measured separately to
assess its impact on the overall Mobile IPv6 handoff time. Using Mobile IPv6 handoff results,
the likely performance impact of Mobile IPv6 handoff on a common webcam application and a
bulk TCP data transfer is also evaluated. The impact of handoff on these applications clearly
shows that a default Mobile IPv6 environment would be highly disruptive to real-time and
interactive applications during handoff events, even if the underlying link-layer handoff was
instantaneous.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mobile IPv6</field><field name="subject">mobile IPv6 hand off</field><field name="subject">hand off time</field><field name="subject">handoff disruption</field><field name="subject">handoff impact evaluation</field><field name="subject">Wireless internet</field><field name="subject">Mobile computing</field><field name="subject">TCP/IP (Computer network protocol)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070608.094836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bose-Einstein condensates on a magnetic film atom chip</field><field name="creator">Whitlock, Shannon</field><field name="description">Atom chips are devices used to magnetically trap and manipulate ultracold atoms
and Bose-Einstein condensates near a surface. In particular, permanent magnetic film
atom chips can allow very tight confinement and intricate magnetic field designs while
circumventing technical current noise. Research described in this thesis is focused
on the development of a magnetic film atom chip, the production of Bose-Einstein
condensates near the film surface, the characterisation of the associated magnetic
potentials using rf spectroscopy of ultracold atoms and the realisation of a precision
sensor based on splitting Bose-Einstein condensates in a double-well potential.
The atom chip itself combines the edge of a perpendicularly magnetised GdTbFeCo
film with a machined silver wire structure. A mirror magneto-optical trap collects
up to 5 x 108 87Rb atoms beneath the chip surface. The current-carrying wires
are then used to transfer the cloud of atoms to the magnetic film microtrap and
radio frequency evaporative cooling is applied to produce Bose-Einstein condensates
consisting of 1 x 105 atoms.
We have identified small spatial magnetic field variations near the film surface that
fragment the ultracold atom cloud. These variations originate from inhomogeneity in
the film magnetisation and are characterised using a novel technique based on spatially
resolved radio frequency spectroscopy of the atoms to map the magnetic field landscape
over a large area. The observations agree with an analytic model for the spatial decay
of random magnetic fields from the film surface.
Bose-Einstein condensates in our unique potential landscape have been used as a
precision sensor for potential gradients. We transfer the atoms to the central region
of the chip which produces a double-well potential. A single BEC is formed far from
the surface and is then dynamically split in two by moving the trap closer to the
surface. After splitting, the population of atoms in each well is extremely sensitive to
the asymmetry of the potential and can be used to sense tiny magnetic field gradients
or changes in gravity on a small spatial scale.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bose-Einstein condensation</field><field name="subject">atom chips</field><field name="subject">ultracold atoms</field><field name="subject">magnetic microtraps</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070613.172308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A pattern-based approach to the specification and validation of web services interactions</field><field name="creator">Li, Zheng</field><field name="description">Web services are designed for composition and use by third parties through dynamic
discovery. As such, the issue of interoperability between services is of great importance
to ensure that the services can work together towards the overall application goals. In
particular, the interaction protocols of a service need to be implemented and used
properly so that the service composition can conduct itself in an orderly fashion. There
have been significant research efforts in providing rich descriptions for Web services,
which includes their behaviour properties. When describing the interaction
process/protocols of a service, most of them adopt a procedural or programming style
approach. We argue that this style of description for service interactions is not natural to
publishing service behaviour properties from the viewpoint of facilitating third-party
service composition and analysis. Especially when dealing with service with diverse
behaviour, the limit of these procedural approaches become apparent.
In this thesis, we introduce a lightweight, pattern/constraint-based declarative approach
that better supports the specification and use of service interaction properties in the
service description and composition process. This approach uses patterns to describe the
interaction behaviour of a service as a set of constraints. As such, it supports the
incremental description of a service's interaction behaviour from the service developer's
perspective, and the easy understanding and analysis of the interaction properties from
the service user's perspective. It has been incorporated into OWL-S for service
developers to describe service interaction constraints.
We also present a framework and the related tool support for monitoring and checking
the conformance of the service's runtime interactions against its specified interaction
properties, to test whether the service is used properly and whether the service fulfils its
behavioural obligations. The tool involves interception of service interactions/messages,
representation of interaction constraints using finite state automata and finite state
machine, and conformance checking of service interactions against interaction
constraints. As such, we provide a useful tool for validating the implementation and use
of services regarding their interaction behaviour.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">web service</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">validation</field><field name="subject">interaction protocol</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070618.115228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narrative identity in transition: the lived experience of an organisational merger in local government</field><field name="creator">Jones, Bonna Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the question of how narrative activity influences the conditions in which a new sense of self is actively emergent for an employee at a time of organisational merger.

It is contended that an organisational merger is a transformational event with complex temporal and spatial characteristics, involving the activities of making shared meaning (MacIntyre, 1981; Ricoeur, 1974a), narrative-making (Carr, 1986; MacIntyre, 1981; Ricoeur, 1984, 1985, 1988) and positioning (Bourdieu, 1993, 1998b). These activities are central to the conditions in which persons and organisations are both formed and reformed. Consideration of how they are part of a project of narrative identity (Ricoeur, 1984, 1985, 1988, 1992) opens new possibilities in our understanding of the lived experience of a merger.

In appropriating narrative theory, this thesis is exploratory in nature as narrative ideas have not, to date, been applied to an understanding of the lived experience of an organisational merger. Mergers are currently understood as a clash of cultures, and a merger is treated as a marriage with partners, compatibility, commitment, rituals, dominance and fit. Whereas culture is construed in the literature as a quality that differentiates one organisation from another, and personal experience is understood in terms of adjusting to the presence of another culture, in this thesis a different theory is employed.

The main theory integration in this thesis gives prominence to the dynamic of activity/passivity (Allen &amp; Starr, 1982; Schelling, 1800/1978) and the notions of agency, relationship, transformation, and identity. Narrative theory is integrated with social theory (Bourdieu, 1998b) to enrich our understanding of these notions. Hence this thesis extends the contribution of Drummond (1996, 1998), and is situated in the constructive postmodern stance of process philosophy (Gare, in press-a; Griffin, 1993). This stance is invoked as a response to calls for better theories of action in management studies (Reed, 1996; Wilmott, 1994). It is argued, in agreement with Gare (in press-a, in press-b), that living organisms have a complexity that makes it difficult to maintain a state of indifference with respect to changes in their environment, and that they must form and reform themselves as products. Attention within management studies to self-organising activity at the levels of person, organisation and field of practice, is therefore central to our understanding of complex events such as organisational mergers. In this regard narrative-making and positioning are self-organising activities that are yet to be brought to centre stage in management theory. While no previous work has been done to apply narrative ideas to an understanding of mergers, such a move is nevertheless consistent with the increasing interest in narrative that is occurring across the theoretical divides in management studies.
The application in this thesis concerns a merger of two government organisations. These organisations, herein given the fictitious names of 'Anessa' and 'Isengate' (for reasons of confidentiality), were each part of what is usually referred to in local government as 'a council'. This thesis is about the employees in these organisations during this time of political amalgamation of the two councils, and the consequent organisational merger. Through interviews with informants, the use of documents, and the integration of theory, a narrative is created. Of the many narratives that could be offered about this merger, it is the narrative given here that constitutes a response to the research question. Hence the methodology used sustains the purpose, which is to contribute to a reading experience, and the possibility of new interpretations regarding the lived experience of an organisational merger.
This thesis concludes that it is at the level of 'ongoing argument' that persons and organisations are contributors to the process of 'making shared meaning'. At the federal level of government this argument is about how best to govern, and at the level of the field of practice it encompasses the argument over what constitutes public service activity. The State Government of Victoria actively furthered this contest when it undertook local government reform. It is argued that their narrative about local government reform has a life as part of 'economic rationalism' (Pusey, 1991), and it proceeds from an ideological position in a tradition of readings known as 'neoliberalism' (Bourdieu, 1998a).
In this thesis employees are regarded as actively emergent beings living out a process of narrative identity. Under the authorship of the State Government employees were positioned as passive characters in the narrative of local government reform. For the employees considered in this thesis, this brought closure to a current and projected life narrative as a public servant at the local level. Their response was to reauthor their position to transcend this limitation, but it was found that this activity could be further limited according to the capital an employee could acquire in the form of 'time to tell a story' and 'space to tell a story'.
The main contribution of this thesis, as a response to calls for better theories of action in management studies, is an exploration of how individual employees are processes of becoming, and how they participate in the becoming of the organisation and field to which they contribute. It is concluded that employees could be valued as processes of becoming, and this is a major contribution that they make to the field and organisation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">consolidation and merger of corporations</field><field name="subject">mergers</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">narrative</field><field name="subject">corporate culture</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050422.120609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The boundaryless career is there a disparity between theory, practice and worker desire in relation to older workers?</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Patrick Bernard</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the capacity and desire of older workers to provide discretionary
effort and skilled contributions in what some researchers consider to be the predominant
form of new career, the 'boundaryless career'. Features of the 'boundaryless career'
include multiple employers, and the demise of the organisational loyalty that was
embodied within the image of the 'company man'. The research is justified by the fall
in Australia's fertility rates and the simultaneous ageing of Australia's population.
In combination, these are predicted to produce significant shortfalls in skilled labour,
which experts believe will require organisations to better manage and utilise its older
workers.
The case study and pattern matching methodology involved interviews with forty
volunteer older workers who worked in the headquarters of Australia Post, which enjoys
a formidable local and international reputation. 'Career plateau' was a term used by
many to describe their perception of their current career position and prospects.
Their descriptions of their work situation and their ambitions, at work and in retirement,
were analysed for patterns which were then compared with literature on career plateaus,
motivation and job design, and the 'boundaryless career'. This analysis was overlaid
onto a foundation of contemporary management practice with regard to older workers,
current business environments and issues, and views on the skill sets needed for the
future. This foundation emerged from a review of academic literature, business and
government reports and from an ongoing review of the Australian Financial Review
over the six years of the study.
Contributions to theory and practice are claimed in the parent theories of career plateau,
and older worker motivation; together with the focus theory of boundaryless careers.
Although there are legitimate organisational constraints on optimising the older worker
contribution, older workers do not contribute to capacity, and organisations do little to
optimise their contribution. Joint organisational and individual worker attention to
skills maintenance and career management over an entire working life will likely be 'boundaryless' for both organisations and the older workforce.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older workers</field><field name="subject">boundaryless career</field><field name="subject">career plateau</field><field name="subject">motivation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070621.132034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the use of past experience in single and multiple agent learning classifier systems</field><field name="creator">Foster, Kate Yvonne</field><field name="description">The field of agent control is concerned with the design and implementation of components that form an agent's control architecture. The interaction between these components determines how an agent?s sensor data and internal state combine to direct how the agent will act. Rule-based systems couple sensing and action in the form of condition-action rules and one class of such systems, learning classifier systems, has been extensively used in the design of adaptive agents. An adaptive agent explores an often unknown environment and uses its experience in its environment with the aim of improving its performance over time. The data an adaptive agent receives regarding the current state of its environment might be limited and ambiguous. In learning classifier systems, three different approaches to the problem of limited and ambiguous data from the environment have been: (1) to enable the agent to learn from its past experience, (2) to develop sequences of rules (in which rules may be linked implicitly or explicitly) and (3) multiagent LCSs.
This thesis investigates the use of an adaptive agent?s past experience as a resource with which to perform a number of functions internal to the agent. These functions involve developing explicit sequences of rules, detecting and escaping from infinite loops, and firing and reinforcing rules.
The first part of this thesis documents the design, implementation and evaluation of a control system that incorporates these functions. The control system is realised as a learning classifier system and is evaluated through experiments in a number of environments that provide limited and ambiguous stimuli. These experiments test the impact of explicit sequences of rules on the performance of a learning classifier system more thoroughly than previous research achieved. The use of explicit sequences of rules results in mixed performance in these environments and it is shown that while the use of these sequences in simple environments enables the rule space to be more effectively explored, in complex environments the behaviours developed by these sequences result in the agent stagnating more often in corners of the environment.
Rather than endowing the rule-base with more rules, as in previous research with explicit sequences of rules, it is proposed that multiple interacting agents may enhance the exploration of the rule space in more complex environments. This approach is taken in the second part of this thesis, where the control system is used with multiple agents that interact by sharing rules. The aim of this interaction is to enhance the rule discovery process through cooperation between agents and thus improve the performance of the agents in their respective environments. It is shown that the benefit obtained from rule sharing is dependent on the environment and the type and amount of rule sharing used and that rule sharing is generally more beneficial in complex environments compared to simple environments. The properties of the rule-bases developed in these environments are examined in order to account for these results and it is shown that the type and amount of rule sharing most useful in each environment are dependent on these properties.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intelligent agents (Computer software)</field><field name="subject">Machine learning</field><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20051117.112922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Masculinities, friendship and support in gay and straight men's close relationships with other men</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Richard Callum</field><field name="description">In this qualitative study, gay and straight men's experiences in male friendships were examined in order to explore differences and similarities between the participants' construction of masculinities. A social constructionist approach to understanding human experience was utilised, through an examination of in-depth interviews with 21 men (10 straight, 11 gay). The data was interpreted following a hermeneutic phenomenological approach, utilising the lens of Gestalt therapy theory, resulting in a series of essence statements, which expressed the underlying structures of the participants' experiences of masculinity. These findings revealed constructions of masculinities which were explored in relation to the participants' close male friendships and support seeking processes. A major finding was the importance of shame as a regulating variable in the gay and straight participants' construction of their masculinity. Shame or avoidance of shame appeared to be linked to the influence of a dominant heterosexual masculine ideology. It was revealed that whilst dominant masculine ideologies were experienced as powerful 'background' beliefs, the participants were able to construct contemporaneous masculinities that were contextual and field sensitive. Thus the concept of masculinities appears inherently fluid, and changeable. Furthermore, the results indicated different definitions of friendship which appeared to be related to different constructions of masculinity. The gay participants' friendships were described in interpersonal terms compared with the straight participants' friendships which appeared more focussed on external activities. The experience of shame, or fear of the potential for shame emerged as important variables that influenced intimacy, closeness and distance in gay and straight participants' friendships and their ability to seek and receive emotional social support. The finding that men appear to seek help from male friends in ways that are consistent with their constructions of masculinity has important implications for fostering supportive interactions between men. Furthermore, an understanding of men's experiences regarding what constitutes a supportive interaction and defines intimacy appears important as these views will most likely guide their decision making processes  about from whom and how they might seek support. Finally, the possibilities for constructing new masculinities are explored as men's friendships and support behaviour are both influenced by, and in turn influence, the construction of masculinities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">masculinities</field><field name="subject">gay</field><field name="subject">straight</field><field name="subject">homosexual</field><field name="subject">heterosexual</field><field name="subject">shame</field><field name="subject">gestalt</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">friendship</field><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">support</field><field name="subject">intimacy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070626.125734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the effects of a psychosocial intervention on mood, coping and quality of life in cancer patients</field><field name="creator">Reavley, Nicola</field><field name="description">The popularity of non-mainstream cancer treatments raises complex issues for patients

(QOL). Those with higher levels of mood disturbance and lower QOL at baseline
benefited more than those who were less well adjusted.
Analysis of three, six, and 12-month follow-up data showed high compliance with
program recommendations. Improvements seen at program completion were mostly not
maintained at follow-up, although improvements from baseline were. These results
suggest that the program has significant beneficial effects on adjustment but that these
may not be fully maintained at follow-up, possibly due to difficulty incorporating program
recommendations into everyday life and increasing disease severity. Study limitations
include self-selection, high drop-out rates and lack of a control group.
Initial investigation suggested that quality of meditation experience was linked to
improved adjustment and this thesis describes the initial development of a scale to assess
the effects of meditation, which was divided into two sections: Experiences During
Meditation and Effects of Meditation in Everyday Life, and trialled on 236 participants.
Scale evaluation involved factor analysis, reliability and validity analysis. The
Experiences During Meditation scale had five subscales: Cognitive effects, Emotional
effects, Mystical experiences, Relaxation and Physical discomfort. The Effects of
Meditation in Everyday Life scale had a single factor structure, with the final scale
consisting of 30 items.
Construct validity was explored by assessing correlations with the measures: Perceived
Control of Internal States, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, FACIT Spiritual wellbeing
subscale, POMS-Short Form and Physical Symptoms Checklist. It is anticipated that the
scale may be useful for clinicians and researchers and may contribute to improved
understanding of the effects of meditation practices.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychosocial intervention</field><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">meditation</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070703.142553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human resource management in the hotel industry in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Yang, Hui-O</field><field name="description">This thesis examines contemporary human resource management (HRM) in the hotel industry in Taiwan.  The hotel industry and the effective management of its human resources are of great economic significance for Taiwan, given the government's plans for doubling the number of international arrivals between 2002 and 2008 (Tourism Bureau 2005b). Yet previous research on this topic is scarce, consisting of only four studies, three of them unpublished Master's theses. Access to two of the studies is limited and all four studies have adopted a 'single issue' perspective in their investigation. This study has attempted a broader perspective, inviting exploration in an open-ended way of a range of contemporary issues and concerns. It also offers a literature review intended as a significant contribution in its own right, in its attempt to locate research helpful to the Taiwanese hotel industry.

The specific aims of this study were to explore the way managers in the hotel industry are thinking about what they identify as concerns, the HRM issues and practices they perceive as important in employee management, and the future plans they have for HRM. The data were gathered from the manager which each hotel identified as being best placed to discuss these issues.  Findings from this study are presented with interpretation and commentary offered to compare the themes raised in this study with those identified in the literature.  


Given the high proportion of quantitative studies in hospitality industry research across the world (Lucas and Deery 2004), a qualitative method is utilised in this research and in-depth interviews were chosen as the main vehicle for data collection. The characteristics of such qualitative research are exploratory and descriptive, creating a data set that is not possible to obtain through written questionnaires and surveys. Twenty-eight hotels were approached and fourteen hotels participated in this research, representing a 50 per cent response rate.

The results suggest that most participating hotels are focused on dealing with the day-to-day operational challenges of shortages of appropriately skilled staff, seasonal variations in workforce demand and employee turnover. While they perceive these issues as significant and challenging, they were mostly inclined to view these as 'facts of life' in the industry, and were relatively limited in their thinking about more fundamental and strategic solutions for dealing with them. However, some hotels are developing more innovative approaches to effectively engaging with these challenges, such as participating in joint-training programs with other hotels; developing long-term relationships with internship students; increasing employee empowerment and using the Balanced Scorecard (Nair 2004; Niven 2006) in performance management.

This study explores some ways in which these practical initiatives could be taken further.  It also takes up a key theme which emerged from the interviews, namely the vital importance of developing sound customer service cultures and practices. Some practical ideas are explored to assist in this respect. On the bases of these findings, this study also concludes that human resource managers have a valuable role to play in the executive management teams of hotels. This role needs to be further developed and encouraged.  The current and emerging challenges facing the industry demand an approach to HRM which is far more strategic than the traditional focus of personnel administration; instead, HRM has a key role to play in creating and sustaining competitive advantage in organisations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human resource management</field><field name="subject">hotel industry</field><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070704.091205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes to gambling in Melbourne among adolescents of different ethnic backgrounds</field><field name="creator">Burnes, Colleen</field><field name="description">Three hundred and fifty Years 10,ll and 12 students from six coeducational
schools in metropolitan Melbourne were surveyed regarding their gambling
behaviour with the use of a survey which included the Australian Gambling
Scale (AGS) (Senn, 1996), The questionnaire also included a Gambling
Activities Checklist, Superstition Scale and Leisure Activities Checklist. The
first hypothesis, that being male would be a predictor of gambling fiequency
and problem gambling, was not supported. However, the second hypothesis,
that early age of onset of gambling, experience of a big win, family interest
in gambling and superstitious beliefs would predict gambling frequency, and
that gambling frequency along with the previously listed variables would
predict problem gambling was partly supported. Having had an early big
win, parental gambling, western superstition (but not eastern), gambling for
excitement, gambling to win money and gambling with friends predicted
gambling frequency. Gambling fiequency, gambling for excitement and
gambling to win money predicted problem gambling. Ethnic differences
were found in predictors of gambling frequency and problem gambling.
Reliability analysis on the newly-developed AGS indicated high internal
consistency (1 =.90). The scale needs to be validated by comparing it to a
well-established problem gambling scale, such as the South Oaks Gambling

the beginning of the study of human behaviour. Mechanistic perspectives regard humans
to be independent objects motivated by external contingencies, with needs to be both self sufficient
and self-enhancing. Organismic perspectives describe humans as having innate
self-organisational tendencies, which partly depend on qualities of relationships with
others. Basic needs for well-being include being self-determined and socially integrated.
Both perspectives claim empirical support. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory
(SDT), the present study proposed that basic needs for well-being include autonomy and
relatedness, and ego-defensive needs that undermine health include independence,
control and narcissism. To compare the effects of different needs on well-being, the
present study measured people's perceived needs and the satisfaction of those needs,
within the context of interpersonal interactions. Participants were sourced from the
student population at a Melbourne university (N = 82), and various internet website
forums (N= 171). Included were 82 participants who had received a diagnosis of social
anxiety in the past two years. A new measure, the Interpersonal Needs Scale (INS) was
developed to tap the strength of values for the five needs of interest, and the degree to
which needs are satisfied. Factor analysis on the INS produced four value subscales:
these were named Authenticity and Belonging, comprising autonomy and relatedness
items, and Independence and Narcissism, both including Control items. The fmal version
of the INS showed satisfactory reliability and validity. Results for Study 1 indicated that
for the present sample, Authenticity and Belonging values were associated with overall
interpersonal need satisfaction and with well-being. Conversely, Independence and
Narcissistic values were associated with dissatisfaction of interpersonal needs and
compromised well-being. For Study 2, cluster analysis was used to group participants
according to their INS profiles: that is, similarities in their perceived needs and their
degree of satisfaction of needs. In line with predictions, the groups included: the Selfother
Balanced (N = 42), who reported significantly greater values for authenticity and
belonging over independence and narcissism, and overall need satisfaction; the Slightly
Lonely (N = 53), who reported similar value ranking but some dissatisfaction of needs;
the Satisfied Narcissists (N = 45), who reported high values for ego-defensive needs and
satisfaction of narcissistic needs only; the Needy Narcissists (N= 81), who also reported
high values for ego-defensive needs but high overall need dissatisfaction; and the
Individualists (N = 27), who reported low values for belonging and unsatisfied
independence needs. The characteristics of each group were analysed and compared with
each other according to a range of self-concept measures (autonomous-self, relational self,
independent-self, and narcissistic personality), indicators of psychological wellbeing
(depression, anxiety, stress, and self-esteem), and social well-being (alienation).
The Self-other Balanced group reported the highest well-being scores and a
predominantly autonomous self-concept, while those who reported low values for
belonging needs (Individualists), and those who reported the least satisfaction of
interpersonal needs (Needy Narcissists), reported the most compromised well-being. A
large proportion of respondents with social anxiety belonged to the latter group. The
implications of these results for understanding the impact of values and the satisfaction of
interpersonal needs on well-being were discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">well-being</field><field name="subject">self-determination</field><field name="subject">autonomy</field><field name="subject">relatedness</field><field name="subject">individualism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070730.134810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The efffects of eletromagnetic fields emitted by mobile phones on human sleep and melatonin production</field><field name="creator">Loughran, Sarah Patricia</field><field name="description">The use of mobile phones is continually increasing throughout the world, with
recent figures showing that there are currently more than 2 billion mobile
phone users worldwide. However, despite the recognised benefits of the
introduction and widespread use of mobile phone technologies, concerns
regarding the potential health effects of exposure to the radiofrequency
electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile phone handsets have similarly
increased, leading to an increase in demand for scientific research to
investigate the possibility of health effects related to the use of mobile
phones.
An increasing amount of radiofrequency bioeffects research related to mobile
phone use has focussed on the possible effects of mobile phone exposure on
human brain activity and function, particularly as the absorption of energy in
the head and brain region is much higher than in other body regions, which is
a direct result from the close proximity of the mobile phone to the head when
in normal use. In particular, the use of sleep research has become a more
widely used technique for assessing the possible effects of mobile phones on
human health and wellbeing, and is particularly useful for providing important
information in the establishment of possible radiofrequency bioeffects,
especially in the investigation of potential changes in sleep architecture
resulting from mobile phone use.
A review of the previous literature showed that a number of studies have
reported an increase in the electroencephalogram spectral power within the 8
&#65533; 14 Hz frequency range in both awake and sleep states following
radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure. In regards to sleep, the
enhancements reported have not been entirely consistent, with some early
studies failing to find an effect, while more recent studies have reported that
the effect differs in terms of particular frequency range. However, in general
the previous literature suggests that there is an effect of mobile phone
emissions on the sleep electroencephalogram, particularly in the frequency
range of sleep spindle activity.
In addition to changes in spectral power, changes in other conventional sleep
parameters and the production and secretion of melatonin have also been
investigated, however, there has been little or no consistency in the findings
of previous studies, with the majority of recent studies concluding that there
is no influence of mobile phone radiofrequency fields on these parameters of
sleep or melatonin.
Following a detailed review of the previous research, the current study was
developed with the aim to improve on previous methodological and statistical
limitations, whilst also being the largest study to investigate mobile phone
radiofrequency bioeffects on human sleep. The principle aims were thus to
test for the immediate effects of mobile phone radiofrequency
electromagnetic fields on human sleep architecture and the secretion of the
pineal hormone, melatonin.
The experiment included 50 participants who were randomly exposed to
active and sham mobile phone exposure conditions (one week apart) for 30
minutes prior to a full night-time sleep episode. The experimental nights
employed a randomised exposure schedule using a double-blind crossover
design. Standard polysomnography was used to measure subsequent sleep,
and in addition, participants were required to provide urine samples
immediately following exposure and upon waking in the morning. A full
dosimetric assessment of the exposure system was also performed in order
to provide sufficient details of the exposure set-up used in the current thesis
and to account for the lack of detailed dosimetric data provided in the
majority of previous studies.
The results of the current study suggest that acute exposure to a mobile
phone prior to sleep significantly enhances electroencephalogram spectral
power in the sleep spindle frequency range compared to the sham exposure
condition. The current results also suggest that this mobile phone-induced
enhancement in spectral power is largely transitory and does not linger
throughout the night. Furthermore, a reduction in rapid eye movement sleep
latency following mobile phone exposure was also found compared to the
sham exposure, although interestingly, neither this change in rapid eye
movement sleep latency or the enhancement in spectral power following
mobile phone exposure, led to changes in the overall quality of sleep.
Finally, the results regarding melatonin suggested that, overall, overnight
melatonin secretion is unaffected by acute exposure to a mobile phone prior
to sleep.
In conclusion, the current study has confirmed that a short exposure to the
radiofrequency electromagnetic fields emitted by a mobile phone handset
immediately prior to sleep is sufficient to induce changes in brain activity in
the initial part of sleep. The consequences or functional significance of this
effect are currently unknown and it would be premature to draw conclusions
about possible health consequences based on the findings of the current
study.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sleep</field><field name="subject">electroencephalogram (EEG)</field><field name="subject">melatonin</field><field name="subject">mobile phones</field><field name="subject">electromagnetic fields (EMF)</field><field name="subject">bioelectromagetics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070731.100218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopy of extra-galactic globular clusters</field><field name="creator">Pierce, Michael John</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is the study of stellar populations of extra-galactic glob-
ular clusters (GCs) by measuring spectral indices and comparing them to simple
stellar population models. We present the study of GCs in the context of tracing
elliptical galaxy star formation, chemical enrichment and mass assembly.
In this thesis we set out to test how can be determined about a galaxy's formation
history by studying the spectra of a small sample of GCs. Are the stellar population
parameters of the GCs strongly linked with the formation history of the host galaxy?
We present spectra and Lick index measurements for GCs associated with 3 el-
liptical galaxies, NGC 1052, NGC 3379 and NGC 4649. We derive ages, metallicities
and a-element abundance ratios for these GCs using the x2 minimisation approach
of Proctor &amp; Sansom (2002).
The metallicities we derive are quite consistent, for old GCs, with those derived
by empirical calibrations such as Brodie &amp; Huchra (1990) and Strader &amp; Brodie
(2004). For each galaxy the GCs observed span a large range in metallicity from
approximately [Z/H]=&#65533;2 to solar.
We find that the majority of GCs are more than 10 Gyrs old and that we can-
not distinguish any finer, age details amongst the old GC populations. However,
amongst our three samples we find two age distributions contrary to our expecta-
tions. From our sample of 16 GCs associated with the 1-2 Gyr old merger remnant
NGC 1052, we find no young GCs. If a significant population of GCs formed during
this merger we would expect those GCs to have low mass-to-light ratios and be
included in our sample of bright GCs. We find 4 young GCs in our sample of 38
around NGC 4649, an old massive cluster elliptical. There are no signs of recent
star formation and therefore we do not expect any GCs to have formed within the
galaxy. These results seem to indicate that the GC systems of elliptical galaxies are
not strongly associated with recent field star formation.
We find a correlation between the &#945;-element abundance ratio and the metallicity
for all three samples. Using Thomas, Maraston &amp; Korn (2004) models, we measure
much higher &#945; abundance ratios for low metallicity GCs than high metallicity GCs.
With current data and models we are limited in both the accuracy and the detail
with which we can probe this relationship.
We suggest that there are some difficulties reconciling measured GC parameters
with our expectations and propose some future work which could help to resolve
these and other issues.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">galaxy</field><field name="subject">star cluster</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">dark matter</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070731.104253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The soul of the organisation passion for the primary task</field><field name="creator">Eastoe, Sara A.</field><field name="description">This thesis assumes that the real essence of an organisation is its connectedness to the primary task.  Hence the metaphor of 'soul' and the notion that passion for the task must be present to create 'soul'.   It therefore follows that the nature of the primary task is central to the type of organisations that is created. 

The past decade of downsizing and the rise of the 'high performance culture' have developed their own narrative about delivering shareholder value.  Alongside this, too often, exists the feeling that "this place has lost it soul".  From that perspective, this thesis addresses the question: how does an increased focus on shareholder value impact on the organisation's passion for its primary task?

In a qualitative study based on semi-structured interview data, the characteristics of the task of shareholder value delivery and its impact on customer service delivery are described in this thesis as have been reported by the informants of three large business units from The Australian Banking Corporation, Plc. (ABC), the fictionalised organization which forms the case study for this research.  Drawing on a psycho-analytic theoretical frame of organisational theory, the dynamic that this shift in task has created is identified and interpreted.  

From this phenomenological position, the findings clearly reveal that shareholder value is identified as the current primary task of the organisation, and has become deeply embedded through a business model promoting separated specialist businesses within the umbrella of ABC. 

The findings show that the tension between delivering service to the customer as stakeholder, the initial primary task, and the current task of delivering shareholder value is unconsciously contained through a process of splitting and projection to establish an idealised customer.  The concept of social defense is applied to interpret this dynamic as it enables ABC to engage in the fantasy that it remains customer focussed.  In order to replace the primary task of customer service with the task of delivering shareholder value, a process of substitution and mutation developed unconsciously  from fear for the survival of ABC which, equally unconsciously connected the notion of service with the desire to serve the shareholder.  

The pain and anxiety produced by downsizing and continual attention to cost reduction, highly characteristic of the shareholder value model, substantially reduced organisational morale and, in this context, ABC embraced a genuine desire to create a new set of values and a healthy culture.  However, what emerged was a religious fundamentalist culture that protects and reinforces the task of delivering shareholder value.  Weber's protestant fundamentalism model promoted the creation of financial wealth through hard work while generating feelings of inclusion to render the task of shareholder value more palatable in the organisation. These two systems became symbiotic though the task values intrinsic in delivering shareholder value were recognised as being devoid of altruism. The dogma driven by the system is fundamentalist, the culture is divisively individualistic and passion for the newly accepted primary task is apparently impossible.  Hence, it is concluded, the organisational 'soul' of ABC has been corroded.

The implications of these findings for practice are concerned with the impact of the task of pursuing shareholder value, and the system it creates as they impact on ABC's ability to change and adapt so that:
-	Short-termism and risk aversion appear to be affecting the capacity of the CEO to lead the organisation into a growth phase.
-	Adoption of the specialisation model at ABC, supported by the CEO with a competitive individual reward program, appears to have reduced the potential for ABC to institute change in response to market evolution.
-	The preparedness of the CEO to risk investment in the medium to long term for growth while managing the short-term expectations of the market has been diminished.
-	The heroic CEO that the shareholder value model attracts is now concerned about his own legacy, which is impacting on his preparedness to promote a vision for the medium to longer term. 
-	The culture supports the status quo and is now promoted by ABC as part of what differentiates it from its competitors.  To change this, it will need to look outside ABC. This, however, appears to have become a blind spot.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">unconscious study of shareholder and customer</field><field name="subject">corporate culture</field><field name="subject">stockholders</field><field name="subject">corporations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070808.113423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of marital interaction the relationship between Gottman's conflict resolution style and 'four horsemen', attachment theory, perception, gender and marital satisfaction</field><field name="creator">Whelan, Susan Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The purpose of the current study was to examine links between Gottman's (1994, 1999) conflict resolution (CR) styles and marital distress indicators (the four horsemen), adult attachment, and Snyder's (1997) marital satisfaction inventory. (MSI-R).  One hundred and one heterosexual couples (202 individuals; mean age = 43.5 years, SD = 11.15), currently involved in a marital style relationship (length of relationship M = 19 years, SD = 10.8), were recruited via undergraduate psychology students at a Melbourne university, who requested the questionnaires be completed by their parents or other relatives if they were not eligible for inclusion, and via a Melbourne relationship counselling centre.  No evidence was found for matching of conflict resolution styles between partners in the couples, therefore hypotheses testing matching of conflict resolution style against marital distress indicators, marital satisfaction and attachment orientation were not supported.  Women were found to score higher on the anxiety adult attachment dimension than men, but no gender differences were found on the 'avoidance' adult attachment dimension.  Hypotheses testing links between adult attachment and Gottman's conflict resolution styles (CR) were supported.  Participants classified into the secure attachment category were found to score significantly higher in validating CR than those classified as avoidant (dismissive or fearful), and significantly lower in volatile CR than preoccupied participants. Avoidant CR scores were found to be significantly lower amongst secure women than dismissive women, and amongst secure men than both dismissive and fearful men. The hypothesis that women would be higher in contempt and criticism than men was supported, whilst the prediction that men would be higher in stonewalling than women was not supported.  Participants classified as secure were associated with lower levels of marital distress indicators and marital dissatisfaction variables than those classified as insecure, as predicted; however some gender differences were apparent in the pattern of differences between the attachment groups in these variables.  The hypothesis testing partners' similarity to one another on Gottman's marital distress indicators was not supported; however strong support was found for the notion that partners believed themselves to be similar to their partners on these variables.  The hypothesis that secure or dismissive participants would have greater perceived similarity than preoccupied or fearful participants was supported for men but not for women.  The prediction that anxious attachment scores would be associated with higher accuracy of partner perception was supported for women but not for men.  The prediction that anxious attachment would decrease with age and length of relationship was supported for women but not for men; and the final prediction that accuracy of partner perception would diminish with length of relationship was supported for men but not for women.  Overall, results of the current study indicate that there are subtle differences between men and women in the experience of distress in marital relationships, as well as in how relationships change over time.  Further, the current research offers evidence that the conflict resolution styles proposed by Gottman may be related to attachment orientation, and may offer some explanation as to how various attachment needs are met via these different methods of marital interaction.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">marital interaction</field><field name="subject">attachment</field><field name="subject">Gottman</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070813.144947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social value creation as a core determinant from the impact of social entrepreneurship</field><field name="creator">Gillin, Loris Olwyn</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to find out what Social Value is, how it
is created and in what way it is related to Social Entrepreneurship. The
study has been done at a time when the concept of Social
Entrepreneurship has come to the forefront at the outset of the 21st
Century; in an advent of rapid change and worldwide turmoil; yet an
academic understanding of Social Entrepreneurship has been lacking.
A Western-style capitalist economy has a highly functioning 'for-profit'
and government regulatory system, with civil society which carries an
obligation to have regard for those who 'have not.' The goodness-of-fit
between all three sectors determines the harmony, order and satisfaction
of a given population.
We now know that social Value is created when communities are
impacted with outcomes from the inspiration and perspiration of Social
Entrepreneurs and Support teams who are committed to alleviating
human need.
Social Entrepreneurs and their teams have a different outlook on life.
They live with a lack of financial security, are time-poor, persevering,
and resourceful; and they manage risk even as need is being resourced.
Based upon a robust literature of Entrepreneurship and Values theories
for meaning, data collection allowed for ten social ventures to be casestudied.
These lead to further enquiry into seven peak bodies designed to
be resourcing agencies. This research is important because a model has
been developed which effectively enables social ventures to service their
mission, and to stay viable. As a result of this, a way forward has been
identified where the impact from social entrepreneuring becomes a core
determinant of created Social Value.
The contribution of this research has been to lay a foundation in grassroots
social entrepreneurship which is supported by a Literature which
others following can add to or further define. There is now something
comprehensive drawn from the experiences of many in the field uipon
which to base further enquiry and future investigation.
Suggestions have also been made which need reinforcing at the Public
Policy level; others in the Social Policy sector will want to know the way
to reengineer a way out of the 'gap' which exists in the Capitalist System.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social value</field><field name="subject">social entrepreneurship civic/community sector</field><field name="subject">resourcing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060905.101857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Particle size, hydrophobicity and flotation response</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Russell J.</field><field name="description">Quartz particles of various discrete particle size ranges have been methylated to varying known mounts using trimethylchlorosilane and their flotation behaviour has been assessed in a modification of the Hallimond tube. For each particle size there is a definite degree of.
surface coverage below which the particles do not float. A 'flotation domain' is identified which shorvs that both coarse (-100pm) and fine (-10pm) particles require a greater degree of surface coverage to initiate flotation than do intermediate (-40pm) particles.
Water contact angles have been measured on quartz plates and powders which have been methylated (under the same conditions) with trimethylchlorosilane. Both advancing and receding water contact angles measured on quartz plates as a function of degree of surface
methylationare in good agreement with the angles predicted by the Cassie equation. Advancing water contact angles measured on quartz particles as a function of degree of surface methylation are also in good agreement with angles predicted by the Cassie equation up to surface coverages of'about 70%. The angles measured at higher
surface coverages are less than those anticipated by the Cassie
equation.
The flotation behaviour of the particles has been compared with that predicted by existing flotation theories. It has been shown that coarse particle behaviour is predicted by the kinetic theory of
flotation proposed by Schulze. Fine particle behaviour, however, only qualitatively agrees with Scheludko's theory of fine particle behaviour.
Calculated induction times, in conjunction with observed flotation behaviour, indicate that the bubble-particle attachment process is most efficient for particles of about 38pm in diameter ander the set experimental conditions used in this study.
Flotation rate trials were performed for three particle size ranges and rate constants were evaluated for the various degrees of surface

They attract revenue from a variety of government and non-government sources, and yet, as non-profit organisations they are judged by governments, peers and their communities on their performance in teaching and research rather than on a financial bottom line.

In order to achieve these results, university managers must make decisions on how to allocate available funding throughout the university.   Faced with competing demands on scarce funds, how do university managers make these choices?  One option is to use a resource allocation model to 'crunch the numbers'.  Resource allocation models can incorporate a number of elements - student and staff numbers, weightings and performance data, for example - to allocate available funds.  These allocation models are used in different ways in different universities, but serve the same basic purpose of assisting decision-making on how much to allocate to different sections of the organisation.  Such models operate within a process and context that includes the strategic aims of the University, the organisation structure, its committees and culture. 

This thesis contains case studies of resource allocation models and processes used in three Australian universities.  It examines the methods used for resource allocation at the first and second levels within each university; that is, from the Vice-Chancellor to Dean (or equivalent), and from Dean to Head of School (or equivalent). Observations and conclusions are drawn on the models used, the processes surrounding the models, and the continuity between the two layers of allocations.

The research finds all the case-study universities operate models at multiple levels in their organisations, and that there is a concerning lack of consistency and flow-through at these different levels.  The messages that the university leadership intends to send through the allocations may be lost to managers one-process removed from them.  The research also concludes that transparency is the most important element of the resource allocation process.  University staff dealing with allocation processes will accept the results, even if they are not ideal, if they can understand how and why decisions were made.

As a professional doctorate thesis, the aim is to provide a practical aid to people with responsibility for resource allocation in universities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">resource allocation model</field><field name="subject">budget model</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">australia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070828.164416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantification of Greenhouse Gases at Visy Industries using Life Cycle Assessment</field><field name="creator">Wiegard, Jean</field><field name="description">Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are vital components of the earth&#65533;s atmosphere, trapping heat around the earth, maintaining temperatures necessary for human existence.  Until the Industrial Revolution, these gases existed in a natural equilibrium with the environment.  Since that time, anthropogenic activities such as fossil fuel burning and land clearing have increased the quantity of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), in the earth&#65533;s atmosphere.  Evidence indicates that global warming is occurring as a result of the additional accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere. 
International response to climate change resulted in the 1997 development of the Kyoto Protocol.  If the Protocol is ratified, developed countries will be legally bound to reduce their GHG emissions in accordance with negotiated emission reduction targets.  At the beginning of the year 2001, the Protocol was still to be ratified. 
With the possibility of future GHG emission restrictions, some Australian companies have started quantifying their GHG emission levels.  One such company is Visy Industries, the largest privately owned paper packaging manufacturing company in the world.  Visy&#65533;s core business is the manufacture of cardboard boxes from recycled paper.  As part of its future operations, a kraft pulp and paper mill is presently being built in New South Wales, Australia. 
The environmental decision support tool, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), was used to quantify Visy&#65533;s CO2 and CH4 emissions across the entire life cycle of the Visy paper recycling and virgin papermaking processes.  Commercially defined LCA models were developed for both papermaking processes.
GHG emissions estimated by each model were compared and the effect of different energy sources, technologies and manufacturing processes on CO2 and CH4 emissions were assessed.  The majority of emissions in the two Visy papermaking models were due to fossil fuel derived energy sources and the decomposition of wood fibre in Solid Waste Disposal Sites (SWDSs).  Results were used to propose appropriate GHG reduction strategies and business opportunities.
GHG reduction strategies included increasing the use of renewable energy, reducing the volume of solid waste rejects sent to SWDS, incinerating solid waste rejects with energy recovery and sourcing steam from third party providers.  Proposed GHG business opportunities included increasing the production of Greenpower from the pulp and paper mill for sale to the grid. 
This thesis is an example of the practical application of current GHG knowledge and LCA methodology that was undertaken in an environment where technical, political and commercial guidelines at both a national and international level were still evolving.    Nevertheless, the thesis is not a critical review of LCA methodology.
The LCA support tool was able to quantify CO2 and CH4 emissions across the life cycle of the Visy recycling and virgin papermaking processes.  The chosen functional unit, the assumptions and exemptions made, and the placement of the system boundaries, were found to be critical to the Visy LCA results.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">greenhouse gas emissions</field><field name="subject">life cycle assessment</field><field name="subject">paper products</field><field name="subject">paper recycling</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">papermaking</field><field name="subject">Visy Industries</field><field name="subject">Visys recycling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20030729.140753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aerodynamics of rectangular slot-burners and combustion in tangentially-fired furnace</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Shakil</field><field name="description">The power generation industry in the state of Victoria, Australia stands to gain significantly from process improvements and optimization which can potentially lead to cleaner production of cost effective electricity. The efficient operation of lignite based tangentially-fired combustion systems depends on critical issues such as ignition and combustion of the fuel, which are largely controlled by burner aerodynamics. The geometry of the burner and the ratio of velocities between the primary and secondary jets play an important role in achieving stable combustion, high burnout of fuel, low production of pollutants and control of fouling. Slot-burners are a vertically aligned stack of rectangular nozzles delivering primary fuel and secondary air jets, and are commonly used in tangentially-fired boilers. To obtain a better understanding of the overall combustion process, it is important to understand the aerodynamics of jet development from these burners. 
The starting point of this research was a CFD investigation of aerodynamics in the near-burner region of isolated rectangular slot-burners, using isothermal conditions, for various secondary to primary jet velocity ratios (&#966;). Cross-flow was then added to replicate a near-burner flow field similar to that found in a tangentially-fired furnace and the effect of changing &#966; in the near-burner region of the developing jets was again investigated. Experiments were carried out on an isothermal physical-burner model to obtain mean velocity and turbulent statistics for different nozzle geometries and a range of &#966;. A computational fluid dynamics investigation of these same jets was also performed to gain further insights into the complexities of flow field with experimental results used to validate CFD predictions. The primary jet substantially deviated from the geometric axis of the burner towards the furnace wall and became very unstable for higher &#966;. The causes of unfavourable aerodynamics were discussed and suggestions were made on possible remedies for such behaviour. Conventional lignite combustion in a full-scale tangentially-fired furnace was modelled. The model was used to assess the possibility of utilizing a new type of mechanically thermally dewatered (MTE) coal in existing furnaces.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">slot-burners</field><field name="subject">furnaces</field><field name="subject">jets</field><field name="subject">coal</field><field name="subject">combustion</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070918.123957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why EI matters : the effects of emotional intelligence on psychological resilience, communication and adjustment in romantic relationships, and workplace functioning</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Andrew R.</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the relative importance of six emotional intelligence (EI) abilities comprising the Swinburne University Emotional Intelligence Test (SUEIT) in the prediction of (1) psychological resilience to negative life events, (2) romantic relationship adjustment and communication behaviour, and (3) employability skills. 
In Study 1, the strength of relationship between negative life events and distress varied across three latent classes, reflecting vulnerable, average, and resilient profiles. Graduated EI scores, in terms of emotional self-awareness, ability to express, and self-manage emotions, predicted membership to each class. Across the 414 survey respondents, these three EI abilities appeared to augment psychological resilience in the aftermath of negative life events. 
In Study 2, all six EI abilities were found to be weakly associated with dyadic adjustment, and moderately associated with eight relationship enhancing communication behaviours. The eight behaviours were themselves moderately to very strongly associated with adjustment. Mediation analyses revealed that each EI ability influenced dyadic adjustment through the communication behaviours it best predicted. Across the 116 romantic partners surveyed, those better able to express and self-manage emotion communicated in the most relationship enhancing ways. 
In Study 3, four of the six EI abilities were found to be differentially important in the prediction of seven Adaptive Performance dimensions, five Conflict Management strategies, three forms of Organizational Commitment, and seven Achievement Motivations. The abilities to think clearly under pressure, identify others' emotions, self-manage emotions, and manage others' emotions made valuable contributions, while emotional self-awareness, and the ability to express emotion, did not. Across the 105 workers surveyed, those with these four EI abilities appeared to have decidedly stronger employability skills, skills that distinguish between more and less successful workers of similar education and vocational experience, across all job families. 
These findings are largely consistent with EI theory, and with the small body of research to have examined similar effects in similar domains. Importantly however, the current findings offer much more specific insights into the relative importance of each EI ability in each context, and thus, the means by which emotional intelligence contributes to a psychologically healthy, intimately connected, and vocationally valuable life.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">emotional intelligence</field><field name="subject">resilience</field><field name="subject">romantic relationships</field><field name="subject">workplace functioning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070926.131639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The assessment of postnatal depressionn, anxiety and stress using a cognitive vulnerability-stress model : a role for perceived control and individual characteristics</field><field name="creator">Miller, Renee</field><field name="description">In comparison to the vast literature on postnatal depression, there exists a paucity of
studies that examine anxiety and stress in postnatal populations. This thesis drew from
the cognitive vulnerability-stress theories of depression, anxiety, and stress to form its
theoretical basis. The underlying premise was that stressful life events have the
potential to interact with cognitive vulnerability or characteristic ways of thinking to
result in distress for some individuals. New motherhood was therefore conceptualized
as a life event that can trigger not only depression, but anxiety and stress in vulnerable
women. A major aim of this thesis was to assess the prevalence of postnatal distress
using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Depression Anxiety
Stress Scales (DASS-21). The sample comprised 325 primiparous mothers who ranged
in age from 18 to 44 years (M=32 years), whose babies were aged between 6 weeks and
6 months. Women were recruited through mother's groups and health centres in
Melbourne.
Results revealed that over and above the 61 women (19%) who were classified
by the DASS-21 as depressed, a further 33 women (10%) showed symptoms of anxiety
or stress without depression. This finding supports the assertions that postnatal women
need to be assessed for broader indicators of psychological morbidity than that of
depression alone. Moreover, 7% of the sample were both anxious and depressed, and
had significantly higher mean scores on the EPDS and DASS-depression scales than
their depressed-only counterparts. This sub-group also had significantly lower levels of
maternal role satisfaction and general life satisfaction than depressed-only women.
Other significant findings in relation to the anxious-depressed sub-group, point to the
importance of assessing the comorbidity of anxious and depressive symtomatology, and
of recognizing the extent to which these women may be at heightened risk compared to
depressed-only women.
This thesis adapted the biopsychosocial model of postnatal depression proposed
by Milgrom, Martin, and Negri (1999) as a research framework for examining a number
of unique predictors of postnatal distress. Drawing from an extensive literature on
control, two control-related scales were developed (the Perception of Control and Order
Scale, and the General Desire for Control and Order Scale). These scales, along with
several other cognitive measures, were found to significantly differ in ratings between
distressed and non-distressed women. The findings substantiated a role for both controlIII
related perceptions (perceptions of control and order, self-efficacy, and perceived
control of internal states) and individual characteristics (perfectionism and fear of
negative evaluation) in the postpartum. In a final analysis of the cognitive
vulnerability-stress model, factors that remained significant that made a unique
contribution to the postnatal literature were perceptions of control and order, perceived
control of internal states, fear of negative evaluation, and perceived criticism/judgement
from women's mothers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postnatal</field><field name="subject">postpartum</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">anxiety</field><field name="subject">cognitive</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070927.084941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and application of a methodology for the evaluation of a health complaints process</field><field name="creator">Hackworth, Naomi Jean</field><field name="description">The aim of the current study was to develop and test a methodology that could be
applied to the evaluation of the complaints processes of regulatory bodies of health
professionals in Australia including mental health regulatory bodies such as the board
that the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) are planning to set up to
regulate the psychology profession. The methodology was applied to the evaluation
of the complaints process at the Office of the Health Services Commissioner of
Victoria (HSC). There were four main research questions. The first research
question related to the extent to which the methodology was able to determine how
well the HSC was performing in their role of resolving health complaints. The second
research question explored the implications of the findings of the evaluation of the
HSC complaints process for the management of health complaints in general. The
third research question related to the strengths and limitations of the methodology
when applied in a practical setting and the final research question related to further
improvement of the methodology for future applications. Questionnaires and
telephone interviews were used to examine the experiences of 133 providers and 150
complainants whose complaints had been reviewed and closed in one year. The
methodology proved successful in assessing the performance of the complaints
process at the HSC. The findings of the evaluation indicated that complainants and
providers were generally satisfied with the process by which their complaints were
managed. However, they were in general less satisfied with the outcome. In
particular the evaluation highlighted the unintended negative consequences that
complaints processes can have on the complainants and respondents. It was
concluded that these maladaptive behavioural responses to complaints most probably
have their origins in the negative emotional overlay attached to health complaints
which has the potential to lead to unrealistic expectations of the process and
outcomes on the part of complainants, and maladaptive post-complaint practices for
health service providers. The findings highlight the importance of providing
advocacy and support for the parties involved in health complaints as a means of
minimising these maladaptive responses. Finally, it is acknowledged that these
findings are specific to Australian health regulatory systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">health service evaluation</field><field name="subject">clinical governance</field><field name="subject">complaining behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070928.092053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cortical activity associated with rhythmic grouping of pitch sequences</field><field name="creator">Harris, Philip G.</field><field name="description">Segmentational grouping in music listening refers to the organisation of individual tones
into tone groups that tend to be processed and subsequently recalled as perceptual units
or chunks. Grouping of tones via this process tends to occur at natural breaks in
structure of a tone sequence, so that relatively larger changes in pitch, amplitude or
timing are perceived as boundaries which cue the segmentational grouping process.
Segmentational grouping processes have been examined using behavioural research
techniques; yet neurophysiological processes underlying the grouping process have
received little attention, and are poorly understood. This study aimed to identify brain
regions involved in the segmentational grouping process as cued by rhythmic
information. Participants performed two auditory tasks while brain electrical activity
responses were monitored using Steady-State Probe Topography (SSPT).
Behavioural responses evoked in a task probing individuals' use of lengthened-duration
tones to organise memory for pitch sequences indicated that longer-duration tones were
used as cues to organise working memory representations of the musical patterns.
Examination of dynamic SSPT responses during the encoding phase of a probe
recognition task indicated that greater use of rhythmic cues to organise working
memory representations was associated with activation of a network of left hemisphere
frontal, temporal and parietal regions. During the lengthened tone, activation of left
central and vertex regions and progressive activation of left temporal and
temporoparietal regions were linked with use of the deviant status of the lengthened
tone to update temporal expectations for the sequence. Excitatory responses observed in
left posterior frontal and temporal regions to a tone following the lengthened tone were
proposed to reflect temporal allocation of attention to this point in time, whereas
sustained excitatory activation of left temporal, and temporoparietal regions reflected
the role of these regions in supporting representations of the tone events in working
memory. Finally, late inhibitory responses to the tone following the lengthened tone in
left frontal, temporal, temporoparietal, and parietal regions were linked with the
manipulation and closure of the working memory trace in association with the grouping
process. Together, these findings support the activation of a network of left frontal,
temporal and parietal regions underlying rhythmic grouping of pitch sequences.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive neuroscience</field><field name="subject">brain imaging</field><field name="subject">eeg</field><field name="subject">working memory</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">grouping</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20071001.113258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a predictive damage condition model of light structures on expansive soils using hybrid artificial intelligence techniques</field><field name="creator">Osman, Norhaslinda Yasmin</field><field name="description">Expansive soils have damage light structures due to movement of soil which was a common problem all around the world. Soils exhibiting expansive properties were common throughout Australia. The damage to light structures founded on expansive soils in Victoria occurred mainly in properties built on quaternary basaltic clays and Tertiary to Ordovician clays. A review of existing literature in the area of expansive soils showed a lack of a thorough scientific diagnostic of the damage to light structures founded on expansive soils. Very few studies had been performed on damage to light structures on expansive soils in Victoria. There were no models so far to predict damage condition to light structures. More over, most of the reports on damage to light structures on expansive soils in Victoria were poorly documented. The aim of this research project was to develop a model to predict the damage condition of light structure on expansive soils in Victoria. A hybrid Neural Network trained with Genetic Algorithm was adopted for the de-velopment of the Predictive Damage Condition model. The Neural Network and Ge-netic Algorithm toolboxes from MATLAB&#65533; version 7.1 were used. The development of a Predictive Damage Condition model was driven by the shortage of defined quanti-tative studies and methods of selecting the factors that influenced the damage to light structure on expansive soils. The data used was based on information extracted from the Building Housing Commission which was recorded by different engineering companies based only on the tenants complain and site investigation of the properties. A series of factors that were believed to be dominant in influencing damage to light structures were chosen including: structural type, foundation, the presence of vegetation, soil type, age, and climate change. The model showed that it was able to resolve the problems facing light structures on expansive soils. First and foremost, the Predictive Damage Condition model was able to predict the damage condition or damage class using different combinations of fac-tors. It was also possible to identify the factors contributing to the damage of the struc-ture and to assess their relative importance in causing damage to light structures on expansive soil. It was found that the construction footing and vegetation were the most important among all the other input parameters. Change in Thornthwaite Moisture In-dex or climate was ranked second. Construction wall and age, were ranked third and fourth respectively while both region and geology were ranked fifth. In addition, Change in Thornthwaite Moisture Index was noted to have the strongest correlation with other input parameters.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">light structure</field><field name="subject">expansive soils</field><field name="subject">damage</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20071002.131831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactive user experience design  : creating an effective online experience</field><field name="creator">Park, Ji Yong</field><field name="description">Designing for user experience is central to good web design, particularly in e-commerce

a chronic illness or disability, and analysis of what factors may buffer this stress and be
associated with well child resilience in the face of family illness. Several major studies
from other countries (Cadman, Boyle, &amp; Offord, 1988; Houtzager, Grootenhuis, Caron
&amp; Last, 2005; Laufersweiler-Plass, Rudnik-Schoneborn, Zerres, Backes, Lehmkuhl &amp;
von Gontart, 2003; Sharpe &amp; Rossiter, 2002; Williams, Williams, Graff, Hanson et al.,
2002) suggest that there may be deleterious outcomes for well children in such families,
for example higher rates of anxiety, depression, aggressive behaviour and rule
breaking behaviour. However there is a lack of clarity about the processes which lead
to these negative outcomes. The current study had two major research aims. The first
was to describe social, family and personal characteristics of a group of well children
with siblings who have a chronic illness or disability. The second aim was to examine
relationships between adjustment problems in these well children and factors relating to
the family (income, number of children in family, respite availability and utilisation),
parents (stress, parenting style, maternal education, access to support) and children (ill
child behaviour, amount of care required, well child age, well and ill child participation
in social activities). Adjustment in well-children (n=102) was assessed using child self
report, child projective and parent rating measures. Parents rated well children with ill
siblings as significantly higher in externalising and internalising behaviour than age and
gender matched population norms. Children did not rate their behaviour problems
higher than norms but did indicate quite high rates of emotional problems on a
projective (drawing) test. Parent-rated behaviours of well children were associated with
parental, family and ill child variables, including (high) parental stress (daily hassles),
(low) family income and (high) ill child internalising and externalising behaviours.
Relationships between the well child's perception of having a sibling with a chronic
illness or disability and various parent, child and family variables were also explored.
Well children who listed more negative (than positive) attributes about having a sibling
with a chronic illness were more aggressive and rule breaking in their behaviour. Well
children with emotional problems, as assessed by the child family drawings, did not
differ significantly from children without emotional problems in any of the parent, child
or family variables however both the emotional problems index and the use of scribble
drawings were associated with several measures of well child maladjustment. The
results were discussed in terms of family systems and resilience theory. Implications
for well children and their families including practical applications for existing
interventions which target well children, ill siblings and parents were discussed and
ideas for future directions for interventions to improve outcomes for well siblings were
presented.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">siblings</field><field name="subject">chronic illness</field><field name="subject">resilience</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20071009.105131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and production of polymer based miniaturised bio-analytical devices</field><field name="creator">Garst, Sebastian</field><field name="description">The aim to provide preventive healthcare and high quality medical diagnostics and
treatment to an increasingly ageing population caused a rapidly increasing demand for
point-of-care diagnostic devices. Disposables have an advantage over re-usable units
as cross-contamination is avoided, no cleaning and sterilising of equipment is required
and devices can be used out of centralised laboratories. To remain cost-effective, costs
for disposables should be kept low. This makes polymer materials an obvious choice.
One method for the realisation of fluidic micro devices is the stacking of several
layers of microstructured polymer films. Reel-to-reel manufacturing is a promising
technique for high-volume manufacturing of disposable polymer bio-analytical
devices. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and cycloolefin copolymer (COC) were
selected as suitable polymer substrate materials and polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) as
membrane layer.
Bonding of polymer films with the help of adhesives carries the risk of channel
blocking. Despite this drawback, no other method of bonding PDMS to a structural
layer could be identified. Bonding with solvents avoids channel blocking issues, but
adversely affects biocompatibility.
Thermal diffusion processes enable bonding of COC and PET without the use of any
auxiliary material. The extensive process times requires for thermal diffusion bonding
can be considerably shortened by pre-treating the material with plasma or UV
exposure. Welding with the use of a laser energy absorbing dye was demonstrated to
be particularly suitable for selective bonding around channels and reservoirs.
None of the assessed bonding methods provide a generic solution to all bonding
applications. Instead, the selection of an appropriate technique depends on the
intended application and the required level of biocompatibility. Since this selection
has implications on the feasibility and reliability of microfluidic structures on the
device, design rules which ensure design for production have to be established and
followed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bio-analytical devices</field><field name="subject">3d multilayer structures</field><field name="subject">polymer materials</field><field name="subject">bonding technology</field><field name="subject">packaging</field><field name="subject">microfluidics</field><field name="subject">lab on a chip</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20071003.082618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel fabrication processes for thin film vapour deposited strain gauges on mild steel</field><field name="creator">Djugum, Richard</field><field name="description">Pressure measurement using a strain gauge bonded with epoxy adhesive to a metallic
mechanical support has been, and still is, extensively employed, however, for some
applications the use of an epoxy is inadequate, especially when temperatures exceed
120C. There is therefore particular interest in the use of thin film techniques to
vacuum deposit strain gauges directly on metallic substrates. Such devices are highly
cost effective when produced in large quantities due to the manufacturing techniques
involved. This makes them ideally suited for use in large-volume products such as
electronic weighing scales and pressure transducers. In this thesis, new techniques for
fabricating thin film vapour deposited strain gauge transducers on metal substrates for
application as novel pressure sensors in the fastener industry are developed.
Clearly, for a vapour deposited strain gauge to function correctly, it is essential that it be
deposited on a defect free, high quality electrically insulating film. This was a
significant challenge in the present study since all available physical vapour deposition
(PVD) equipment was direct current (DC) and insulators of around 4 um thick were
needed to electrically isolate the strain gauges from metal. As a result, several methods
of depositing insulators using DC were developed. The first involved the use of DC
magnetron sputtering from an aluminium target to reactively deposit up to 4 um thick
AlN. DC magnetron discharges suffer arc instability as the AlN forms on the target and
this limits the maximum thickness that can be deposited. Consequently, the arc
instability was suppressed manually by increasing argon gas flow at the onset of arcing.
Although the deposited AlN showed a high insulating resistance, it was found that the
breakdown voltage could significantly increase by (a) utilising a metallic interlayer
between the thin film insulator and the metallic substrate and (b) annealing in air at
300C. A second deposition method involved the use of DC magnetron sputtering to
deposit modulated thin film insulators in which an aluminium target was used to
reactively deposit alternating layers of aluminium nitride and aluminium oxide. These
films showed significant increases in average breakdown voltage when the number of
layers within the composite film was increased. The third method involved the
deposition of AlN thin film insulators using partially filtered cathodic arc evaporation
with shielding. Initially, AlN was deposited under partially filtered conditions to obtain
a relatively thick (~ 4 um) coating then, while still depositing under partially filtered
conditions, a smooth top coating was deposited by using a shielding technique. The
deposition of metal macroparticles is an inherent problem with cathodic arc deposition
and shielding is one form of macroparticle filtering. Such particles are highly
undesirable in this study as they are electrically conductive. A fourth coating technique
for depositing insulators on steel was based on thermal spray technology. Insulating
films of Al2O3 were plasma sprayed and then polished to thereby fabricate viable
electrical insulators for vapour deposited strain gauges.
With respect to depositing strain gauges two methods were employed. The first
involved the sputter deposition of chromium through a shadow mask to form a strain
gauge with gauge factor sensitivity of around 2. The second used cathodic arc
evaporation to fabricate a multi-layered strain gauge composed of alternating CrN and
TiAlN layers that yielded a gauge factor of around 3.5. The technique achieves better
compatibility between gauge and insulator by allowing a wider selection of materials to
form the gauge composition. Finally, a novel pressure sensor in the form of a load cell
was developed that consisted of a chromium strain gauge on a steel washer electrically
insulated with AlN thin film. The load cell showed good performance when tested under
compressive load.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thin film</field><field name="subject">strain gauges</field><field name="subject">vapour deposition</field><field name="subject">vapor-plating</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070424.115951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-Precision timing and polarimeter of PSR JO437-4715</field><field name="creator">Van Straten, Willem Herman Bernadus</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the recent results of a continuing, high-precision pulsar timing project, currently focused on the nearby, binary millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437_4715. Pulse arrival time analysis has yielded a remarkable series of constraints on the physical parameters of this system and evidence for the distortion of space-time as predicted by the General Theory of Relativity.
Owing to the proximity of the PSR J0437_4715 system, relative changes in the positions of the Earth and pulsar result in both annual and secular evolution of the line of sight to the pulsar. Although the changes are miniscule, the effects on the projected orbital parameters are detectable in our data at a high level of significance, necessitating the implementation of an improved timing model.
In addition to producing estimates of astrometric parameters with unparalleled precision, the study has also yielded the first three-dimensional orbital geometry of a binary pulsar. This achievement includes the first classical determination of the orbital inclination, thereby providing the unique opportunity to verify the shape of the Shapiro delay and independently confirm a general relativistic prediction.
With a current post-fit arrival time residual RMS of 130 ns over four years, the unrivaled quality of the timing data presented herein may eventually contribute to the most stringent limit on the energy density of the proposed stochastic gravitational wave background. Continuing the quest for even greater timing precision, a detailed study of the polarimetry of PSR J0437_4715 was undertaken. This effort culminated in the development of a new, phase-coherent technique for calibrating the instrumental response of the observing system.
Observations were conducted at the Parkes 64-m radio telescope in New South Wales, Australia, using baseband recorder technologies developed at York University, Toronto, and at the California Institute of Technology. Data were processed off-line at Swinburne University using a beowulf-style cluster of high-performance workstations and custom software developed by the candidate as part of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polarimetry</field><field name="subject">pulsar observations</field><field name="subject">PSR J0437_4715 system</field><field name="subject">pulsar timing</field><field name="subject">pulsar polarimetry</field><field name="subject">general relativity tests</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20040311.123754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of three-body interactions on the equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of fluids from molecular simulation</field><field name="creator">Marcelli, Gianluca</field><field name="description">The aim of this work is to use molecular simulation to investigate the role of
three-body interatomic potentials in noble gas systems for two distinct
phenomena: phase equilibria and shear flow. In particular we studied the
vapour-liquid coexisting phase for pure systems (argon, krypton and xenon) and
for an argon-krypton mixture, utilizing the technique called Monte Carlo Gibbs
ensemble. We also studied the dependence of the shear viscosity, pressure and
energy with the strain rate in planar Couette flow, using a non-equilibrium
molecular simulation (NEMD) technique.
The results we present in this work demonstrate that three-body interactions
play an important role in the overall interatomic interactions of noble gases. This
is demonstrated by the good agreement between our simulation results and the
experimental data for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems.
The good results for vapour-liquid coexisting phases encourage performing
further computer simulations with realistic potentials. This may improve the
prediction of quantities like critical temperature and density, in particular of
substances for which these properties are difficult to obtain from experiment.
We have demonstrated that use of accurate two- and three-body potentials for
shearing liquid argon and xenon displays significant departure from the
expected strain rate dependencies of the pressure, energy and shear viscosity.
For the first time, the pressure is convincingly observed to vary linearly with an
apparent analytic y2 dependence, in contrast to the predicted y3/2 dependence
of mode -coupling theory. Our best extrapolation of the zero -shear viscosity for
argon gives excellent agreement (within 1%) with the known experimental data.
To the best of our knowledge, this the first time that such accuracy has been
achieved with NEMD simulations. This encourages performing simulations with
accurate potentials for transport properties.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fluid mechanics</field><field name="subject">Intermolecular forces</field><field name="subject">Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Fluids</field><field name="subject">Molecular dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060112.082425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conductivity and microstructural characterisation of doped Zirconia-Ceria and Lanthanum Gallate electrolytes for the intermediate-temperature, solid oxide fuel cell</field><field name="creator">Kimpton, Justin Andrew</field><field name="description">Lowering the operating temperature of the high-temperature, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) improves both the thermodynamic efficiency and the lifetime of this energy efficient technology. Unfortunately the rate of oxygen-ion transport through the solid electrolyte is temperature dependent, and materials previously employed as electrolytes in the high-temperature SOFC perform poorly at intermediate temperatures. Therefore new oxygen-ion conductors with enhanced ionic conductivity at intermediate temperatures are required. The bulk of the existing literature on high-temperature SOFCs has focussed on zirconia-based binary systems as electrolytes, due to their high ionic conductivity and negligible electronic conductivity. Only select compositions within the zirconia-scandia system have demonstrated acceptable ionic conductivity levels at intermediate temperatures; however unstable phase assemblage and the high economic cost of scandia are clear disadvantages. Ceria-based binary systems have demonstrated improved oxygen-ion conductivity at intermediate temperature compared to many zirconia systems, however significant levels of n-type electronic conductivity are observed at low oxygen partial pressures. Consequently it was thought unlikely that significant increases in ionic conductivity would be found in existing zirconia- and ceria-based binary systems, therefore another approach was required in an attempt to improve the performance of these established fluorite systems. The fluorite systems Zr0.75Ce0.08M0.17O1.92 (M = Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Ho, Y, Er, Yb, Sc) were prepared and investigated as possible, intermediate-temperature SOFC electrolytes in an attempt to combine the higher conductivity found in the ceria systems with the low electronic conductivity observed in the zirconia systems. Also it was anticipated that systems containing dopants not previously observed to confer high ionic conductivity in either zirconia- and ceria-based binary systems, might exhibit enhanced ionic conductivity with expansion of the zirconia lattice resulting from the addition of ceria. All the as-fired Zr0.75Ce0.08M0.17O1.92 compositions possessed the face-centred cubic structure and lattice parameter measurements revealed the anticipated unit cell enlargement as the size of the dopant cation increased. No unusual microstructural parameters were identified that could be expected to interfere with the ionic transport properties in the as-fired compositions. The electrical conductivity was found to be influenced by the dopant-ion radius, the presence of ceria, low oxygen partial pressures and, in some compositions, the formation of poorly conducting, ordered-pyrochlore microdomains dispersed amongst the cubic defect-fluorite matrix. In a second approach to the formulation of new oxygen-ion conductors suitable for the intermediate-temperature SOFC, compounds possessing structures other than the fluorite structure were considered. An examination of the literature for oxides having the pyrochlore, scheelite and perovskite structures showed that the Sr+2- and Mg+2-doped LaGaO3 perovskites (LSGM) possessed ionic conductivity equal to the highest conducting, zirconia and ceria binary compounds. Therefore the perovskite systems La0.9Sr0.1Ga(0.8-x)InxMg0.2O2.85 (X = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) (I-LSGM) were prepared and examined, the objective being to favourably influence structural parameters believed responsible for optimal ionic conductivity, namely the unit cell symmetry and volume. It was found that In+3 systematically substituted for Ga+3 on to the B-site of LSGM at least up to the X = 0.4 composition. While In+3 was found to replace the Ga+3 as expected, Mg+2, which occupies the same crystallographic site, was also replaced by In+3. Up to the X = 0.2 composition, at least two trace level secondary phases were observed to form along with the bulk I-LSGM phase. For I-LSGM compositions with X &gt; 0.2, significantly larger concentrations of the secondary phases were identified. Evidence of a strontium-rich, high-temperature liquid phase was observed also near the grain boundaries on as-sintered and thermally etched surfaces in LSGM and I-LSGM compositions. It is believed that the observed, high sintered density in the complex, doped-LaGaO3 systems is due to the formation of this high-temperature liquid phase. Increasing levels of diffuse scatter and superstructure formation were observed in electron diffraction patterns in the I-LSGM bulk phase (up to X = 0.2), indicating a possible decrease in vacancy concentration and reduced, localised unit cell symmetry. The electrical conductivity in the I-LSGM compositions was believed to be influenced by the distortion of the oxygen-ion conduction path, a reduction in vacancy concentration, formation of stronger dopant-vacancy associates at low temperature and the presence of ordered structures. In addition, phase instability, in the form of subtle ordering in specific crystalline planes, was observed to influence the electrical conductivity as a function of time at intermediate temperatures.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fuel cells</field><field name="subject">Solid oxide fuel cells</field><field name="subject">Electrolytes</field><field name="subject">Oxide</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060727.084311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential value of homoeoprophylaxis in the long-term prevention of infectious diseases, and the maintenance of general health in recipients</field><field name="creator">Golden, Isaac</field><field name="description">Homoeoprophylaxis (HP) is the use of homoeopathically prepared substances to prevent targeted infectious diseases in recipients. Its first use in an epidemic of Scarlet Fever was documented in 1801. It has been used throughout the world since then for both short-term and long-term preventative purposes. The effectiveness and safety of Golden&#65533;s long-term HP program using
homoeopathically prepared substances to prevent targeted infectious diseases in recipients was tested through two research projects. The effectiveness of the program could not be established with statistical certainty given the limited sample size and the low probability of acquiring an infectious disease. However, a possible level of effectiveness of 90.3% was identified subject to specified limitations. Further research to confirm the effectiveness of the program is justified. Statistically significant results were obtained that confirmed the safety of the program both in absolute terms as well as compared to all other methods of disease prevention studied. It also appeared possible that a national immunisation system where both vaccination and HP were available to parents would increase the national coverage against targeted infectious diseases, and reduce the incidence of some chronic health conditions,
especially asthma.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">homeopathy</field><field name="subject">materia medica and therapeutics</field><field name="subject">communicable diseases</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050228.150047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex differences in brain lateralization for clinically depressed patients</field><field name="creator">Spong, Jo-Lene Banita</field><field name="description">Research in neuropsychology has found depression to be related to impaired right hemisphere (RH) functioning. How clinical depression affects brain lateralized functioning for each sex, however, is not clear. The main aim of this thesis was to investigate how clinical depression impacts brain lateralized functioning for each sex. Additionally, this thesis investigates brain lateralization for emotional processing in a non-depressed group, as well as sex differences in brain lateralization for spatial, verbal, and emotional processing in a non-depressed group. In order to examine each of these research areas, sixty non-depressed participants, and thirty-nine dilnically depressed patients were recnjited to complete a set of neuropsychological tasks that measure brain lateralized spatial, verbal, and emotional functioning. The neuropsychological tasks that were selected also measure the brain regions known to be involved with depression (frontal lobe and right parietal lobe). The tasks were: the mental rotation task (MRT) to measure RH spatial functioning; the verbal fluency task (phonemic and semantic) to measure left hemisphere (LH) verbal functioning; and the chimeric faces task to measure frontal lobe emotional functioning. The data from these tasks were reported as two separate experiments.
Experiment One examined sex differences in brain lateralization for spatial and verbal processing in a non-depressed group. Experiment One also investigates brain lateralization for emotional processing in a non-depressed group, in particular to determine whether there is a sex difference in brain lateralization for emotional processing. The aim of Experiment One was to replicate the male advantage in spatial processing and the female advantage in verbal processing, which have previously been interpreted as reflecting sex differences in brain lateralization for these functions. It was also the aim to differentiate between the competing RH and valence hypotheses of brain lateralization for emotional processing and further investigate sex differences in brain lateralization for emotional processing. Sex differences in brain lateralization for spatial, verbal, and emotional processing were examined by comparing the performance of thirty non-depressed males and thirty non-depressed females on the MRT, verbal fluency task, and chimeric faces task respectively. The hypothesis that males would mentally rotate the stimuli of the MRT faster than the females was not supported, as no significant sex differences in performance were
observed on the MRT. Failure to replicate the male advantage in spatial functioning was attributed to a possible sex difference in level of spatial ability, which has been found to mediate hemispheric functioning. The hypothesis that the females would generate significantly more words than the males on the verbal fluency task was supported, thus replicating the female advantage in verbal processing. For the chimeric faces task, the group findings supported the RH hypothesis for brain lateralization for emotional processing, with responses being significanfly faster and more accurate to happy and sad expressions shown in the LVF than in the RVF. No consistent sex differences in performance were observed between the RT and accuracy rate analyses of the chimeric faces task. Reaction times to the chimeric faces showed a LVF advantage in emotional processing for the males, and no hemispheric bias for emotional processing for the females. In contrast, recognition accuracy of the chimeric faces showed a LVF advantage for emotional processing for both the males and the females. The inconsistent sex differences on the chimeric faces task suggests that there is not a strong sex difference in brain lateralization for emotional processing.
Expertment Two investigated brain lateralization for spatial, verbal, and emotional functioning in a clinically depressed group. It was the aim of Experiment Two to determine whether clinical depression is associated with impaired RH functioning, as suggested by the literature. It was also the aim of Experiment Two to examine more specifically, how clinical depression affects brain lateralized functioning for each sex separately. To examine the effect of clinical depression on brain lateralized functioning, the performance of thirty-six (fifteen males, twenty-one females) clinically depressed patients (three excluded from the recruited thirty-nine) and thirty-six (eighteen males, eighteen females) non-depressed control participants was compared on the MRT, verbal fluency task, and chimeric faces task. The hypothesis that clinical depression would be associated with impaired RH functioning was partially supported by the results of Experiment Two. The depressed group performed signiflcantiy poorer than the control group on both the RH task (the MRT intercept and overall R and the LH task (semantic verbal fluency). Therefore, impaired RH and LH functioning on the spatial and verbal task was evidenced for the clinically depressed group in Experiment Two. A RH impairment in emotional functioning with clinical depression could not be clearly ascertained from the results of the chimeric faces task. The RT analyses of the chimeric faces task showed a LVF advantage for emotional processing for both the control and depressed groups. In contrast to the RT analyses, the accuracy rate analyses of the chimeric faces task showed a LVF advantage in emotional processing for the control group, and no hemispheric bias for emotional processing for the depressed group, As the depressed group were significantly impaired for both RH and LH functioning in Experiment Two, it is possible that the findings of Experiment Two are reflective of a generalised performance deficit associated with clinical depression, rather than to a disturbance in brain lateralized functioning. The depressed group was also found to respond significantly slower than the control group in overall RT on the MRT and chimeric faces task. The significant group difference on the intercept of the FART implicates impaired information encoding for the clinically depressed group. The slowed Ris of the depressed group may also reflect impaired pre-motor organization with clinical depression, thus resulting in delayed motor responses.
In relation to the affect of clinical depression on brain lateralizaflon for each sex, it was hypothesised that the depressed males would perform significantly poorer than the depressed females on tasks measuring functions lateralized to the cerebral hemisphere impaired due to clinical depression. The premise for this hypothesis lies in the evidence from past unilateral brain lesion research, which suggests that the stronger brain ateralization of males restricts assistance from the unimpaired hemisphere to perform the task of the impalred hemisphere. The bilateralization of females however, allows greater assistance of the unimpaired hemisphere to perform the task at hand. In contrast to the hypothesis however, there was no evidence from the results of Experiment Two that clinical depression had a greater impact on the brain lateralized functioning of males than females. No significant sex differences in performance on the FART were observed for either the non-depressed control group or clinical depressed group. For the verbal fluency task, a female advantage in word generation was observed for both phonemic and semantic fluency, regardless of group. Also regardless of group, the RT analyses of the chimeric faces task showed that the males responded significantly faster to emotional expressions shown in the LVF than in the RVF. For the females however, there was no hemispheric bias in RT for emotional processing. The accuracy rate analyses from the chimeric faces task also showed no sex differences for either group. The similar findings of sex differences between the control and depressed groups across each task suggests that
clinical depression had a similar impact on both the males and the females, regardless of brain late ralization.
The results of Experiment Two could be indicative of impaired LH and RH functioning with clinical depression, or of a generalised performance deficit with clinical depression. A generalised performance deficit for the clinically depressed group in Experiment Two may explain why a sex difference in the effects of clinical depression on brain lateralized functioning was not observed. Future research observing a RH impairment with clinical depression is encouraged to further examine the affect of clinical depression on brain lateralization for each sex separately. Further understanding of the affect of clinical depression on brain lateralization for each sex could provide addiional information on sex difference in the prevalence of clinical depression.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">sex differences</field><field name="subject">brain lateralization</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070319.125537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards performance-based route selection guidelines for heavy vehicles (the dynamics of heavy vehicles over rough roads)</field><field name="creator">George, Rodney Martin</field><field name="description">With an increasing number of transport operators seeking permits to operate nonstandard
or purpose-built vehicle types, information is required to assist road authorities
to determine which vehicle types could operate on the road network without
compromising the safety of other road users.
A project was created by ARRB TR to develop guidelines for determining route access
for heavy vehicles. This project was developed in conjunction with the state road
authorities, the National Road Transport Commission and the transport industry to
obtain an understanding of the road space requirements for a range of common vehicle
types. This project is the subject of this thesis.
Two series of field experiments were conducted with six common heavy vehicle types
on public roads west of Parkes NSW. Information collected during these full-scale
experiments was used to increase the knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of these
vehicles and to develop model route access guidelines. Data obtained from these field
experiments also provided information to validate computer models and simulation
outputs.
This thesis showed that:
1) There was experimental evidence to demonstrate that vehicle lateral movement is
excited by differences in vehicle wheelpath profiles (point-by-point pavement
crossfall), which make a contribution to trailing fidelity (swept width), offtracking
and swept path;
2) Vehicle type and speed are prime influences on the lateral movement of the rear
trailer and therefore an important input into the model route access guidelines.
Notwithstanding the practical and safety implications of applying different speed
limits for various vehicle types, speed is a prime contributor to vehicle lateral
movement and should be considered when determining route access;
3) Limited lateral position information suggested that one driver of two vehicle types
position the vehicles so that the tyres on the rear trailer track on the sealed
pavement and not on the pavement shoulder;
4) Based on a statistical analysis of the data obtained from the small sample which
only considered the average crossfall of each test section the relative importance of
the key parameters was (highest to lowest), IRI, vehicle speed and vehicle type.
It was shown that good estimates of lateral movement can be obtained using a double
integration technique of the measured lateral acceleration, without applying
compensation for the trailer roll or the pavement crossfall.
It is recommended that route access guidelines be developed using the lateral
performance of a larger sample of vehicles in each class of heavy vehicles operating
over a larger range of road types. The route access guidelines should contain a matrix
of information on vehicle type/length, pavement condition roughness/profile and lane
width. This would provide operators and regulators with a desk-top assessment tool for
determining route access.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trucking</field><field name="subject">Trucks</field><field name="subject">Routes</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Surface roughness</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060629.100558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CFD investigation for turbidity spikes in drinking water distribution networks</field><field name="creator">Hossain, Alamgir</field><field name="description">Drinking water distribution networks such as South East Water Ltd. (SEWL), Melbourne Water, Sydney Water, etc. are supposed to transport only dissolved matter rather than a few visible particles. However, it is almost impossible to make the drinking water free from suspended solid particles. The ability to determine the origins of these particles varies between different water supply systems, with possible sources being from catchment, treatment processes, biofilm growth within the water supply pipes, and corrosion products. Improvement of our understanding of the complex hydrodynamic behavior of suspended and/or deposited particles involved in these distribution pipe networks requires mathematical and physical models. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) along with analytical turbulent model is one of the most popular mathematical techniques, which has the ability to predict the behavior of complex flows for such multiphase flow applications.
This study has been completed mainly in two steps. A CFD investigation was carried out to predict the hydrodynamic behavior of turbid particle flowing through a horizontal pipe networks including loop consist of bends and straight pipes. Furthermore, an extended analytical model was re-developed for the liquid-solid system to look at the similar behavior of the solid particles flowing in a turbulent field. These two parallel studies will provide better understandings about the turbidity spikes movements in the distribution networks.
A comprehensive CFD investigation was carried out for particle deposition in a horizontal pipe loop consisting of four 900 bends in a turbulent flow field. A satisfactory agreement was established with the experimental data as validation. This was a steady state multi-particle problem, which helped to understand the deposition characteristics for different particle sizes and densities at upstream and downstream sides of the bends as well as its circumference. Particle concentration was seen high at the bottom wall in the pipe flow before entering the bends, but for the downstream of bend the deposition was not seen high at the bottom as seen in upstream of bend rather inner side of the bend wall (600 skewed from bottom). The larger particles clearly showed deposition near the bottom of the wall except downstream. As expected, the smaller particles showed less tendency of deposition and this was more pronounced at higher velocity. Due to the high stream line curvature and associated centrifugal force acting on the fluid at different depths the particles became well mixed and resulted in homogeneous distribution near the bend regions.
The hydrodynamic behavior of particles flowing in a turbulent unsteady state flowing through a horizontal pipe was also studied to compare with the drinking water distribution networks data. In this numerical simulation six different flow-profiles and particle-load profiles were used to compute particles deposition and re-entrainment into the systems and to identify the conditions of the deposition and suspension mechanisms. Results showed that after a certain length of pipe and period of time after downward velocity gradient, when the velocity was constants over time, the shear stress was sufficiently high enough to cause the particle deposition on and roll along the bottom wall of pipe wall and created a secondary group of particle peak (called kink).
Finally, an extended analytical Turbulent Diffusion Model for liquid-solid phase was developed following an existing gas-liquid turbulence model. This turbulent diffusion model was then compared with the results of the CFD investigation making use of the same boundary conditions. The comparison established good agreement between these two models. The influence of velocity on the particle size distribution was dominant over the influence of the superficial liquid velocity, which was also explained by using the new parameter, velocity ratio. This velocity ratio was defined as the ratio between the free flight and gravitational velocity. Due to some inevitable assumptions used in the analytical model, the results showed typically less deposition as compared with the CFD investigation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multiphase Flow</field><field name="subject">Distribution Networks</field><field name="subject">Turbulence Flow</field><field name="subject">Diffusion Model</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20071102.161744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fibre-optic nonlinear optical microscopy and endoscopy</field><field name="creator">Fu, Ling</field><field name="description">Cancer is a major health problem in the world today. Almost all cancers have a
significantly better chance for therapy and recovery if detected at their early stage.
The capability to perform disease diagnosis at an early stage requires high-resolution
imaging that can visualise the physiological and morphological changes at a cellular
level. However, resolving powers of current medical imaging systems are limited
to sub-millimeter sizes. Furthermore, the majority of cancers are associated with
morphological and functional alterations of cells in epithelial tissue, currently assessed
by invasive and time-consuming biopsy. Optical imaging enables visualisations of tissue
microstructures at the level of histology in non-invasive means. Optical imaging is
suitable for detecting neoplastic changes with sub-cellular resolution in vivo without
the need for biopsy.
Nonlinear optical microscopy based on multi-photon absorption and higher harmonic
generation has provided spectacular sights into visualisation of cellular events
within live tissue due to advantages of an inherent sectioning ability, the relatively deep
optical penetration, and the direct visualisation of intrinsic indicators. Two-photon
excited uorescence (TPEF) from intrinsic cell components and second harmonic
from asymmetric supermolecular structures can provide complementary information
regarding functionalities and morphologies in tissue environments, thus enabling
premalignant diagnosis by detecting the very earliest changes in cellular structures.
During the past sixteen years, nonlinear optical microscopy has evolved from a
photonic novelty to a well-established laboratory tool. At present, in vivo imaging and
long-term bedside studies by use of nonlinear optical microscopy have been limited
due to the fact that the lack of the compact nonlinear optical instrument/imaging
technique forces the performance of nonlinear optical microscopy with bulk optics on
the bench top. Rapid developments of fibre-optics components in terms of growing
functionalities and decreasing sizes provide enormous opportunities for innovation in
nonlinear optical microscopy. Fibre-based nonlinear optical endoscopy will be the soul
instrumentation to permit the cellular imaging within hollow tissue tracts or solid
organs that are inaccessible with a conventional optical microscope.
Lots of efforts have been made for development of miniaturised nonlinear optical
microscopy. However, there are major challenges remaining to create a nonlinear
optical endoscope applicable within internal cavities of a body. First, an excitation
laser beam with an ultrashort pulse width should be delivered eciently to a remote
place where ecient collection of faint nonlinear optical signals from biological samples
is required. Second, laser-scanning mechanisms adopted in such a miniaturised
instrumentation should permit size reduction to a millimeter scale and enable fast
scanning rates for monitoring biological processes. Finally, the design of a nonlinear
optical endoscope based on micro-optics must maintain great exibility and compact
size to be incorporated into endoscopes to image internal organs.
Although there are obvious diculties, development of fibre-optic nonlinear optical
microscopy/endoscopy would be indispensible to innovate conventional nonlinear
optical microscopy, and therefore make a significant impact on medical diagnosis. The
work conducted in this thesis demonstrates the new capability of nonlinear optical
endoscopy based on a single-mode fibre (SMF) coupler or a double-clad photonic
crystal fibre (PCF), a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) mirror, and a gradientindex
(GRIN) lens. The feasibility of all-fibre nonlinear optical endoscopy is also
demonstrated by the further integration of a double-clad PCF coupler. The thesis
concentrates on the following key areas in order to exploit and understand the new
imaging modality.
It has been known from the previous studies that an SMF coupler is suitable for twoii
photon excitation by transmitting near infrared illumination and collecting uorescence
at visible wavelength as well. Although second harmonic generation (SHG) wavelength
is farther away from the designed wavelength of the fibre coupler than that of normal
TPEF, it is demonstrated in this thesis that both SHG and TPEF signals can be
collected simultaneously and eciently through an SMF coupler with axial resolution
of 1.8 um and 2.1 um, respectively. The fibre coupler shows a unique feature of linear
polarisation preservation along the birefringent axis over the near infrared and the
visible wavelength regions. Therefore, SHG polarisation anisotropy can be potentially
extracted for probing the orientation of structural proteins in tissue. Furthermore,
this thesis shows the characterisation of nonlinear optical microscopy based on the
separation distance of an SMF coupler and a GRIN lens. Consequently, the collection
of nonlinear signals has been optimised after the investigation of the intrinsic trade-off
between signal level and axial resolution.
These phenomena have been theoretically explored in this thesis through formalisation
and numerical analysis of the three-dimensional (3D) coherent transfer function
for a SHG microscope based on an SMF coupler. It has been discovered that a fibreoptic
SHG microscope exhibits the same spatial frequency passband as that of a fibreoptic
reection-mode non-uorescence microscope. When the numerical aperture of
the fibre is much larger than the convergent angle of the illumination on the fibre
aperture, the performance of fibre-optic SHG microscopy behaves as confocal SHG
microscopy. Furthermore, it has been shown in both analysis and experiments that
axial resolution in fibre-optic SHG microscopy is dependent on the normalised fibre
spot size parameters. For a given illumination wavelength, axial resolution has an
improvement of approximately 7% compared with TPEF microscopy using an SMF
coupler.
Although an SMF enables the delivery of a high quality laser beam and an enhanced
sectioning capability, the low numerical aperture and the finite core size of an SMF
give rise to a restricted sensitivity of a nonlinear optical microscope system. The
key innovation demonstrated in this thesis is a significant signal enhancement of a
nonlinear optical endoscope by use of a double-clad PCF. This thesis has characterised
properties of our custom-designed double-clad PCF in order to construct a 3D nonlinear
optical microscope. It has been shown that both the TPEF and SHG signal levels in
a PCF-based system that has an optical sectioning property for 3D imaging can be
significantly improved by two orders of magnitude in comparison with those in an
SMF-based microscope. Furthermore, in contrast with the system using an SMF,
simultaneous optimisations of axial resolution and signal level can be obtained by
use of double-clad PCFs. More importantly, using a MEMS mirror as the scanning
unit and a GRIN lens to produce a fast scanning focal spot, the concept of nonlinear
optical endoscopy based on a double-clad PCF, a MEMS mirror and a GRIN lens has
been experimentally demonstrated. The ability of the nonlinear optical endoscope to
perform high-resolution 3D imaging in deep tissue has also been shown.
A novel three-port double-clad PCF coupler has been developed in this thesis to
achieve self-alignment and further replace bulk optics for an all-fibre endoscopic system.
The double-clad PCF coupler exhibits the property of splitting the laser power as well
as the separation of a near infrared single-mode beam from a visible multimode beam,
showing advantages for compact nonlinear optical microscopy that cannot be achieved
from an SMF coupler. A compact nonlinear optical microscope based on the doubleclad
PCF coupler has been constructed in conjunction with a GRIN lens, demonstrating
high-resolution 3D TPEF and SHG images with the axial resolution of approximately
10 m. Such a PCF coupler can be useful not only for a fibre-optic nonlinear optical
probe but also for double-clad fibre lasers and amplifiers.
The work presented in this thesis has led to the possibility of a new imaging device
to complement current non-invasive imaging techniques and optical biopsy for cancer
detection if an ultrashort-pulsed fibre laser is integrated and the commercialisation
of the system is achieved. This technology will enable in vivo visualisations of
functional and morphological changes of tissue at the microscopic level rather than
direct observations with a traditional instrument at the macroscopic level. One can
anticipate the progress in bre-optic nonlinear optical imaging that will propel imaging
applications that require both miniaturisation and great functionality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microscopy</field><field name="subject">endoscopy</field><field name="subject">photonic crystal fibres</field><field name="subject">microelectromechanical systems</field><field name="subject">tissue imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20070521.155004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing and improving the enablers of innovation the development of an innovation capability assessment instrument</field><field name="creator">Ottaviano, Michael Edward</field><field name="description">The ability to successfully innovate on a sustained basis is critical in today&#65533;s &#65533;hyper-competitive&#65533; environment characterised by increasingly rapid technological change and shortening product life cycles, and where competitors quickly imitate sources of competitive advantage.

An inductive, case-based methodology is adopted utilising action research techniques to develop the Innovation Capability Assessment instrument.  The starting point of the research was an extensive analysis of the corporate entrepreneurship and innovation literature.  The literature provided a basis for understanding what question areas might need to be included in such an instrument and led to the development of an initial theoretical framework and a preliminary assessment instrument. 

The preliminary assessment instrument was further developed and refined via five exploratory case studies.  Three subsequent confirmatory case studies were used to validate the instrument&#65533;s effectiveness.  The case studies were carried out at Australian organisations operating within a variety of industries and of varying sizes, all of whom were looking to improve their innovation performance. Data was collected through interviews with key members of each organisation and through assessment and action planning workshops involving participants from a cross-section of each organisation. The case studies led to additional assessment questions being added to the instrument, and the rationalisation of others.  

This research identifies the enablers of organisational innovation and finds that these are common to all the case organisations involved in the fieldwork.  The innovation enablers form the basis of the Innovation Capability Assessment instrument that measures innovation performance against 21 questions within three key assessment areas: strategic management of innovation, the internal environment, and a series of innovation competencies.  The relative importance of each innovation enabler to the organisation is also assessed.

The Innovation Capability Assessment instrument is shown to be very relevant across a variety of organisation types and sizes.  In addition, it is useful for an organisation to identify and prioritise weaknesses, and develop actions for improving their innovation capability.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">innovation</field><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="subject">capability</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">organizational change</field><field name="subject">technological innovations</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Melbourne</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050707.162428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional imaging studies of executive-attention in humans comparing healthy subjects &amp; patients with neuropsychiatric disorders</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Benjamin James</field><field name="description">One of the major goals of cognitive neuroscience is to better understand the psychological and
neural bases of human executive-attention. Executive or supervisory attention refers to a collection
of higher-order cognitive functions whose primary contribution to behavior is to support controlled
information processing and action. The capacity to control attention is essential for our adaptive
interaction with the environment because it allows flexibility in our responses to ever changing
situational contexts and demands. Executive-attention processes therefore play a unique role in
shaping the human experience.
Use of three-dimensional functional neuroimaging has fast become the empirical standard for
investigating how executive-attention is implemented in the human brain. Most recently, emphasis
has been placed on the use of these techniques to parse discrete components of a putative neural
network relating to action-monitoring and cognitive control processes of the medial and lateral
prefrontal cortex. This work has relied heavily on the use of popular experimental paradigms such
as the Stroop task and their unique capacity to challenge such processes in humans. These tasks
have also been especially useful for conceptualizing the nature of higher-cognitive dysfunction in
complex brain disorders such as schizophrenia.
The focus of this thesis concerns a novel application of the Stroop paradigm and functional imaging
approach to examine executive-attention performance in healthy subjects and patients with
schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. On one hand, this work aimed to address
current ideas on the nature of executive-control mechanisms and how they may be compromised in
these two common psychiatric disorders. On the other hand, this work aimed to examine important
conceptual and methodological issues associated with functional imaging approaches to the study
of higher-cognition and cognitive psychopathology in humans.
In line with connectionist models of executive-attention phenomena, the first study in this thesis
investigated the effects of task practice on a larger-scale neurocognitive network associated with
performance of the Stroop task in healthy subjects. This study involved the use of a novel methodological approach to model physiological covariances or ?functional connectivity? in PET
data, which generated previously unseen and interesting insights into the neural basis of Stroop
phenomena, whilst complimenting existing ideas on the role of the anterior cingulate and lateral
prefrontal cortex in mediating executive-control functions. These findings were then extended to a
comparative study of patients with schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This study
largely corroborated previous reports of prefrontal executive dysfunction in schizophrenia,
although patients also showed evidence for a compensatory strengthening of connectivity in a
fronto-parietal network that accompanied task practice. This finding has important implications for
existing models of higher-cognitive dysfunction and abnormal brain integration in schizophrenia.
For patients with OCD compared to healthy subjects, performance of the Stroop task evoked a
pattern of abnormal connectivity among predominantly corticostriatal regions, including a
previously reported hyperfunction of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. While this latter result
has been linked to a specific disturbance of action-monitoring in patients with OCD, the current
study suggests that this may map onto a more extensive corticostriatal network abnormality in line
with current theoretical models of this illness.
One caveat raised in the first study of patients with schizophrenia concerned the effects of illnesschronicity
and medication on functional imaging studies of higher-cognition and prefrontal
function in schizophrenia. To address this, a second clinical study was undertaken in patients with
a first-episode of schizophrenia (diagnosis confirmed at follow-up) who were examined before and
after commencing antipsychotic treatment. Overall, the findings from this study support the idea of
trait-like disturbances of prefrontal executive function in schizophrenia; however, they also
suggested that aspects of this disturbance may be specific to the critical, early stage of illness -
implicating progressive changes with illness chronicity and/or treatment intervention. These
findings are discussed in relation to the developmental context of cognitive psychopathology in
schizophrenia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Attention</field><field name="subject">Testing</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychological tests</field><field name="subject">Cognition disorders</field><field name="subject">Neuroimaging</field><field name="subject">Psychiatry</field><field name="subject">Cognitive psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20060227.101116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of ice particle production system for ice jet process</field><field name="creator">Shanmugam, Dinesh Kumar</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a comprehensive study of the ice particle production process through experimentation and numerical methods using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) that can be used to produce ice particles with controlled temperature and hardness for use in ice jet (IJ) process for industrial applications. The analytical and numerical modeling for the heat exchanger system are developed that could predict the heat, mass and momentum exchange between the cold gas and water droplets. Further, the feasibility study of the deployment of ice particles produced from the ice jet system for possible cleaning and blasting applications are analyzed numerically. Although the use of Abrasive Water Jet (AWJ) technology in cutting, cleaning, machining and surface processing is a very successful industrial process, a considerable amount of secondary particle waste and contamination impingement by abrasive materials has been an important issue in AWJ process. Some alternate cryogenic jet methods involving vanishing abrasive materials, such as plain liquid nitrogen or carbon dioxide have been tried for these applications, but they also suffer from certain drawbacks relating to the quality, safety, process control and materials handling. The use of ice jet process involving minute ice particles has received relatively little attention in industrial applications. Some researches have concentrated on the studies of effects of Ice Jet outlet parameters of the nozzle and focus tube for machining soft and brittle materials. Most of the work in this area is qualitative and researchers have paid a cursory attention to the ice particles temperature and the efficiency of production of these particles. An extensive investigation to gain insight knowledge into the formulation of ice formation process parameters is required in arriving at a deeper understanding of the entire ice jet process for production application. Experimental investigations were focussed on the measurement of ice particle temperature, phase transitions, ice particle diameter, coalescence and hardness test. The change in ice particle diameter from the inlet conditions to the exit point of the heat exchanger wasinvestigated using the experimental results. These observations were extended to numerical analysis of temperature variations of ice particles at different planes inside the custom built heat exchanger. The numerical predictions were carried out with the aid of visualization studies and temperature measurement results from experiments. The numerical models were further analysed to find out the behaviour of ice particles in the transportation stage, the mixing chamber of the nozzle and focus tube. This was done to find out whether the methodology used in this research is feasible and if it can be used in applications such as cleaning, blasting, drilling and perhaps cutting. The results of the empirical studies show that ice particles of desired temperature and hardness could be produced successfully with the current novel design of the heat exchanger. At the optimum parameters, ice particles could be produced below -60&#65533;C, with hardness of particles comparable to gypsum (Moh&#65533;s hardness of 1.5 to 3). The visualization studies of the process assisted in observation of the phases of ice at various points along the heat exchanger. The results of numerical analysis were found to agree well with the experiments and were supported by the statistical model assessments. Numerical analyses also show the survival of ice particles at the nozzle exit even with high-pressure, high-velocity water/air mixture.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">jets</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">jet cutting</field><field name="subject">heat exchangers</field><field name="subject">ice jet</field><field name="subject">ultrasonic atomiser</field><field name="subject">CFD study</field><field name="subject">visualisation study</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050805.145343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of epilepsy on the psychosocial functioning of young people</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Allison</field><field name="description">Both medical and psychological factors have an important impact upon the psychosocial functioning of young people with epilepsy. The key purpose of this thesis was to identify factors that significantly distinguish young people with
epilepsy who function well from those who do not. A total of 114 young people (40 males, 74 females) with active epilepsy and a mean age of 17.92 years (SD = 3.90) participated. They completed either a paper (60.5%) or an Internet based survey
(39.5%) that comprised demographic, medical and psychosocial measures. These included the Family Assessment Device, Adolescent Coping Scale, Orientation of Life Scale, Hospital and Anxiety Scale, Quality of Life in Epilepsy for Adolescents
Scale and Seizure Concerns Scale. Good and poor psychosocial functioning groups were identified via latent class cluster analysis using anxiety, depression, concerns about epilepsy and health-related quality of life scores. To predict membership of the poor psychosocial functioning group, independent variables were entered into a
hierarchical logistical regression. The final model was a good fit with the data (Hosmer-Lemeshow test: &#967;(8) =5.24, p %gt; .05), explaining 66 per cent of the variance
and correctly predicting 84.1 per cent of the cases. Young people were more likely to
be members of the poor psychosocial functioning group if they had a seizure in the
last month (Wald = 5.63, p %lt; .05), came from families with lower levels of
functioning (Wald = 5.28, p %lt; .05) and made greater use of non-productive coping
strategies such as wishful thinking, withdrawal and worry (Wald = 12.00, p %lt; .01).
The significant contribution of comorbid conditions was reduced when the family
functioning variable was added to the model, suggesting that young people with
multiple chronic illnesses may have lower psychosocial functioning because of
ineffective communication and unsuccessful problem solving within their families.
Similarly, when the non-productive coping strategy variable was added to the model,
the previous significant contribution of sense of coherence was reduced, indicating
that a lower sense of coherence may be a function of the greater use of nonproductive
coping strategies. The findings suggest that in addition to medical
treatment, clinicians can promote better outcomes for young people with epilepsy by
encouraging them to decrease their use of non-productive coping strategies and
increase the levels of communication and problem solving within their families. The
thesis concludes with a review of the methodological limitations of the study and
possible future research directions, including suggestions regarding potential
interventions that may assist the psychosocial functioning of young people with
epilepsy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epilepsy in children</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20080811.093324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic management practices by selected Thai banks and financial organisations (database)</field><field name="creator">Nimmanphatcharin, Nut-tapon</field><field name="description">In recent year, there has been virtually no research into the strategic management practices of the Thai financial services sector. The aims of this research is to explore the strategic management practices of the Thai financial services sector (both banking companies and non-banking companies), and also seeks to identify whether there are differences in the strategic management practices on the basis of size, business type, and ownership respectively. The findings from this research will provide a benchmark against which further research into strategic management in Thailand can be undertaken. The Thai economic crisis (approximately 1997 to 1999) has impacted very strongly on the Thai financial services sector, as evidenced by the reduction in the number of companies and the dramatic increase in non-performing loans. It is against this background, that this research investigates the strategic management practices (including the general environments, the immediate environments, the internal environments, the corporate strategies, and the planning and planning system) of the Thai financial services companies to gain an understanding of their strategic management practices (year 2000) and the changes to their strategic management practices. This research also examined the impact of both internal environmental factors and external environmental factors on the strategic management practices of the Thai financial services companies. The process for this research was based on a through literature review, an analysis of the industry, the development of a conceptual framework (building on prion research overseas), and the development of a survey approach based on personal interviews with carefully selected respondents. This research has selected all the companies in the Thai financial services sector (13 domestic banks, 5 major government banks, 33 foreign bank&#65533;s branches, 33 finance and securities companies, and 10 credit foncier companies) who survived the economic crisis in Thailand. In total of the 99 approached to participate companies, 71 (72%) Thai financial services companies participated in the survey, consisting of 26 finance and securities companies, 18 foreign bank&#65533;s branches, 13 domestic banks, 9 credit foncier companies, and 5 major government banks. In respect to the data analysis, both qualitative and quantitative methods were utilised in this study, using both univariate and multivariate techniques. Of the 71 companies who participated in this research, 80% (N=57) had a formalised strategic planning (FSP) system, which presented 94% of large companies, 100% of medium sized companies, which was 97% of banking companies and 63% of non-banking companies. Whereas, 72% of the small companies has no formalised strategic planning (NFSP) system which was 100% of credit foncier companies and 15% of finance and securities companies. This research also shows that only 6% of foreign majority ownership companies and 32% of Thai majority ownership companies in the Thai financial services sector did not have FSP system. Of the NFSP companies, 50% would implement a FSP system over the next five years. These findings show that the Thai financial services companies have adopted a fairly traditional approach to strategic management and rely heavily on formalised strategic planning system. For these reasons, the major focus of the analysis of this research is on the FSP companies. Of the FSP companies, define their strategic management as the process of sharing the organisational structure, the company&#65533;s resources, the company&#65533;s culture and managerial style, the company&#65533;s long-term goals, the company&#65533;s mission statement, the company&#65533;s strategies, the company&#65533;s planning, and the external environmental factors to build a market position strong enough and an organisational capable enough to achieve successful performance despite unforeseeable events, potent competition, and internal problems. This research shows that there are significant differences in the organisational structure, process, and system either for size, business type, and ownership aspects. Overall, the large companies that comprised most of the domestic banking companies with Thai majority ownership and the foreign bank&#65533;s branches believe they were more likely to be strategically managed through their structures, processes and systems than the other groups of FSP companies. The findings in this thesis shows that these banking companies identified a much clearer managing of planning and planning system which including corporate plans, second level long-term plans, planning&#65533;s objectives, planning&#65533;s roles, planning&#65533;s processes, planning&#65533;s coordination issues, planning&#65533;s structures than the other group of FSP companies. In contrast, of the NFSP companies, the strategic issues and strategies emerged from the vision of the CEO, whereas did not appear to have roles, objectives, etc. for their strategic issues identification and strategy development process, anywhere as clearly as the FSP companies identified for their planning. The evidence from this research shows that the FSP companies were more likely to consider they were strategically managed than the NFSP companies. This research has identified a schematic representation of the strategic management practices of the companies with a FSP system and a NFSP system. The results of this research enables a better understanding of the strategic management practices of the Thai financial services sector. Also, prospective researchers can use data and the conceptual model generated from this research to further develop the theories of strategic management and to explore whether meaningful differences occur between strategic management practices of other Thai industries and the Thai financial services sector. This research as the first significant study of strategic management practices for the Thai financial services sector, provides an important benchmark for future research e.g. strategic management practices of the Thai financial services companies in the next five years, how the Thai financial services companies seek to recover from the major economic crisis etc. Both further research and replication of this research would enhance a meaningful understanding of strategic management practices.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">financial services industry</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">financial institutions</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050802.150105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the sampling distribution in developing understanding of statistical inference</field><field name="creator">Lipson, Kay</field><field name="description">There has been widespread concern expressed by members of the statistics education community in the past few years about the lack of any real understanding demonstrated by many students completing courses in introductory statistics.  This deficiency in understanding has been particularly noted in the area of inferential statistics, where students, particularly those studying statistics as a service course, have been inclined to view statistical inference as a set of unrelated recipes.  As such, these students have developed skills that have little practical application and are easily forgotten.

This thesis is concerned with the development of understanding in statistical inference for beginning students of statistics at the post-secondary level.  This involves consideration of the nature of understanding in introductory statistical inference, and how understanding can be measured in the context of statistical inference.  In particular, the study has examined the role of the sampling distribution in the students? schemas for statistical inference, and its relationship to both conceptual and procedural understanding.  The results of the study have shown that, as anticipated, students will construct highly individual schemas for statistical inference but that the degree of integration of the concept of sampling distribution within this schema is indicative of the level of development of conceptual understanding in that student.  The results of the study have practical implications for the teaching of courses in introductory statistics, in terms of content, delivery and assessment.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematical statistics</field><field name="subject">distribution (probability theory)</field><field name="subject">sampling (statistics)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.swin.edu.au./public/adt-VSWT20050711.161903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Program Evaluation and Policy Management in Australian Central Agencies</field><field name="creator">Di Francesco, Michael Francis</field><field name="description">Of the many components of reform to Australian government administration in the
1980s, the introduction of systematic program evaluation is perhaps one of the least
examined. This thesis seeks to assess the Federal Labor Government's evaluation
strategy as an instrument for enhancing what are here termed the policy management
capacities of central agencies. It proceeds in two steps. First, the thesis traces in detail
the development of program evaluation policy in Australian federal government from
the effectiveness reviews of the Coombs Report of 1976 to the current evaluation
strategy, and argues that, despite competing purposes for it, evaluation was intended
primarily to serve decision making in central government. This policy aim was
cemented by the economic crisis of the mid 1980s and framed around budgetary issues
by its steward, the Department of Finance. Second, in order to assess the impact of the
evaluation strategy, the thesis develops a framework for analysing program evaluation
as one instrument for strengthening the core policy management functions of central
agencies. In this context, policy management is essentially a coordination task. The
contribution of evaluation to two aspects of policy management-resource
coordination, and policy development and coordination-is examined. The findings
confirm that attempts to formalise evaluation processes have had a variable impact-
central budgetary processes remain dependent on relatively informal assessment
procedures, although recent attempts to enhance policy coordination through the
evaluation of policy advising processes have proved potentially to be more influential.
In conclusion, the thesis argues that the evaluation strategy represented a credible
attempt to better inform policy making in central government, but suffered for want of
clear policy design and firm execution that resulted in only a marginal impact on these
processes.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">program evaluation</field><field name="subject">administrative reform</field><field name="subject">budgeting</field><field name="subject">policy advice</field><field name="subject">policy management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">central agencies</field><field name="subject">government administration</field><field name="subject">budget</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010726.162328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Auditory Information Design</field><field name="creator">Barrass, Stephen</field><field name="description">The prospect of computer applications making "noises" is disconcerting to some. Yet the soundscape of the real world does not usually bother us. Perhaps we only notice a nuisance? This thesis is an approach for designing sounds that are useful information rather than distracting "noise". The approach is called TaDa because the sounds are designed to be useful in a Task and true to the Data.
&#182;
Previous researchers in auditory display have identified issues that need to be addressed for the field to progress. The TaDa approach is an integrated approach that addresses an array of these issues through a multifaceted system of methods drawn from HCI, visualisation, graphic design and sound design. A task-analysis addresses the issue of usefulness. A data characterisation addresses perceptual faithfulness. A case-based method provides semantic linkage to the application domain. A rule-based method addresses psychoacoustic control. A perceptually linearised sound space allows transportable auditory specifications. Most of these methods have not been used to design auditory displays before, and each has been specially adapted for this design domain.
&#182;
The TaDa methods have been built into computer-aided design tools that can assist the design of a more effective display, and may allow less than experienced designers to make effective use of sounds. The case-based method is supported by a database of examples that can be searched by an information analysis of the design scenario. The rule-based method is supported by a direct manipulation interface which shows the available sound gamut of an audio device as a 3D coloured object that can be sliced and picked with the mouse. These computer-aided tools are the first of their kind to be developed in auditory display.
&#182;
The approach, methods and tools are demonstrated in scenarios from the domains of mining exploration, resource monitoring and climatology. These practical applications show that sounds can be useful in a wide variety of information processing activities which have not been explored before. The sounds provide information that is difficult to obtain visually, and improve the directness of interactions by providing additional affordances.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">auditory display</field><field name="subject">sonification</field><field name="subject">information design</field><field name="subject">interaction design</field><field name="subject">sound design</field><field name="subject">task analysis</field><field name="subject">computer-aided design</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">user interface</field><field name="subject">multimedia interfaces</field><field name="subject">visualisation</field><field name="subject">data representation</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010702.150218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aggregate Breakdown and Soil Surface Sealing under Rainfall</field><field name="creator">Geeves, Guy William</field><field name="description">Aggregate breakdown is an important process controlling the availability of fine soil material necessary for structural sealing of soil surfaces under rainfall. It may be caused by slaking resulting from rapid soil wetting and by physical dispersion resulting from direct and indirect energetic raindrop impacts. Relationships have been proposed by others predicting steady infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity from final aggregate size following high energy rainfall on initially dry, uncovered soil surfaces. Under these extreme conditions, both rapid wetting and energetic raindrop impact result in maximum aggregate breakdown and surface sealing. Knowledge of the relative importance of these two agents under less severe conditions and knowledge of how increased aggregate stability due to conservative soil management may ameliorate them should improve prediction and management of aggregate breakdown and surface sealing. 
&#182;
	This study has isolated and quantified effects of rapid soil wetting and energetic raindrop impact on aggregate breakdown and surface sealing. Simulated rainfall was applied to re-packed soils from differing tillage treatments on light textured soils from near Cowra and Condobolin in New South Wales, Australia. Aggregate breakdown was assessed using aggregate size distribution, determined by wet sieving and summarised by a range of statistics. The degree of breakdown was assessed after 66 mm of simulated rainfall whilst the rate of change in aggregate size distribution was assessed by sampling after 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 mm. The degree of surface sealing was assessed using final surface hydraulic conductivity after 66 mm rainfall calculated from inferred infiltration and measured sub-seal soil water potential. The rate of surface sealing was assessed prior to ponding using cumulative rainfall volume at ponding and throughout the post-ponding phase by decline in surface hydraulic conductivity as a function of cumulative rainfall kinetic energy. Two levels of raindrop kinetic energy flux and three wetting treatments were used to isolate effects of these agents of aggregate breakdown and surface sealing. 
&#182;
	Significant surface aggregate breakdown was observed when either rapid soil wetting or highly energetic raindrop impact were allowed to occur. The majority of the data suggest a negative interaction between the two agents. When soil was initially dry rapid soil wetting was the dominant agent causing rapid aggregate breakdown, generally within the first 5 mm of rainfall. When rapid soil wetting was prevented by tension pre-wetting, energetic raindrop impact was the dominant agent and was able to cause aggregate breakdown of an almost equivalent degree. This breakdown occurred over a period lasting for up to 30 mm of rainfall. In contrast, the rate and degree of surface sealing were influenced primarily by raindrop kinetic energy with highly energetic impact leading to significant surface sealing, irrespective of soil wetting. For the soils studied, it was concluded that structural sealing of surface soil, could be significantly reduced by protecting the soil surface from energetic raindrop impact but that prevention of surface aggregate breakdown required amelioration of both processes.
&#182;
	In addition to the negative interaction referred to above, a positive interaction was observed whereby energetic raindrop impact occurring concurrently with rapid soil wetting caused a greater degree of aggregate breakdown and a greater degree of surface sealing than energetic raindrop impact occurring subsequent to rapid soil wetting. The effect on surface sealing may be explained by the effect of lower sub-seal water potential that necessarily results from initially dry soil condition required for concurrent rapid wetting. However, the effect on aggregate breakdown remains unexplained. 
&#182;
	Notwithstanding the above, permeability was reduced under high kinetic energy rainfall even when soil wetting was reduced to very slow rates by tension pre-wetting. Likewise, surface sealing did occur under low kinetic energy rainfall for the least stable soil following rapid soil wetting. It was concluded that threshold soil wetting rates and threshold rainfall energy levels, proposed by others, are either not applicable to these soils or are negligible.
&#182;
	The rate and degree of aggregate breakdown was also dependent on the soil with the Cowra soil being more stable than the Condobolin soil. Greater aggregate stability brought about by conservative tillage treatments at both soil locations retarded and reduced surface sealing. Unvalidated simulation modelling was used to illustrate possible effects for the soil water balance. In contrast to the conclusions of Loch (1994b), that were based on soils throughout eastern Queensland, the soil water balance simulations predicted that the residual benefits in ameliorating surface sealing resulting from improved aggregate stability could significantly reduce point runoff under the lower intensity winter rainfalls experienced in southern New South Wales.
&#182;
	Limited testing with Condobolin soil following tension pre-wetting showed that rainfall intensity, varying over the range from 16.5 to 66 mm h-1, had little effect on the decline in surface hydraulic conductivity as a function of cumulative rainfall kinetic energy. This contrasts with greater seal permeability under higher rainfall intensities observed by Romkens et al. (1985) and others. It is proposed that an alternative explanation exists for the observations of Romkens et al. based on reduction in seal permeability due to lower sub-seal water potential under lower intensity rainfall.
&#182;
	Post-ponding reduction in K[subscript sat] under high kinetic energy rainfall exhibited exponential decline as a function of cumulative raindrop kinetic energy as proposed by Moore (1981b). However, inferred rates of decline prior to ponding were more rapid than measured post-ponding rates suggesting that infiltration models using only a single exponential rate of surface K[subscript sat] decline based on post-ponding measurements may be in error. Potential for error is greatest at early times for loose soil that is highly susceptible to sealing. 
&#182;
	Pre-ponding decline in surface aggregation was also relatively more rapid than post-ponding decline. This discrepancy was evident irrespective of soil pre-wetting. From this it was concluded that the more rapid initial aggregate breakdown and surface sealing was due, at least in part, to processes other than aggregate slaking due to rapid soil wetting. An explanation has been proposed as follows. Raindrops initially fall on aggregates that have not been subjected to rainfall and therefore each drop has the capacity to cause greater aggregate breakdown than subsequent raindrops that fall on aggregates or soil fragments that have been strong enough to survive preceding rainfall impacts. Such a mechanism could provide an alternative explanation of the findings of Baumhardt et al. (1991) who found that less cumulative raindrop kinetic energy was necessary to achieve a given reduction in surface conductance when the cumulative energy was supplied through lower energy drops.
&#182;
	Relationships predicting rates of surface sealing using aggregate breakdown under rainfall and aggregate stability were evaluated. Post-ponding infiltration rate and surface K[subscript sat] were related to aggregate size by exponential functions. The proportion of surface aggregates less than 0.125 mm in diameter provided slightly more consistent relationships. Parameters of fitted relationships differed among wetting pre-treatments suggesting that the influence of sub-seal water potential on surface K[subscript sat] must be considered whenever such relationships are developed or applied. Aggregate stability determined by wet sieving was related to rainfall volume required for ponding, final K[subscript sat] and final aggregate size but only for initially dry soil suggesting that such relationships may be unique to the rainfall, soils and flow conditions used to develop them.
&#182;
	This study has established the relative importance of rapid soil wetting and energetic raindrop impact in both aggregate breakdown and surface sealing over a range of antecedent soil water and rainfall conditions. It has quantified the effectiveness of culturally induced aggregate stability in ameliorating effects of these two important agents and illustrated the potentially significant consequences for the soil water balance. It has quantified temporal patterns of surface sealing and aggregate breakdown and proposed an alternative mechanism explaining more rapid aggregate breakdown during the initial stages of rainfall. It has identified possible explanations for effects of rainfall intensity on surface sealing observed in other studies.

These significant findings have been used with the findings of other studies to amend the conceptual model proposed by Le Bissonnias (1990).

Three issues are addressed. These concern the negative identity that results from social comparison processes in school, the role of the  peer group in delinquency and the variable nature of the delinquent social identity.
	One argument of the thesis, which is based on the concepts of self-categorization theory, is that the delinquent social identity develops out of  a negative identity because of perceived differences between  groups of adolescents in the school in terms of their commitment to academic studies and their attitude towards authority. The first study in this thesis demonstrates that compared to non delinquents, delinquents are more likely to perceive their social status in the school to be low as well as stable, and are more concerned about their reputation among their peers. Also, delinquents are more likely to rationalize against guilt through the techniques of neutralization,  are more likely to value unconventional norms and tend to have negative experiences, both at home and in school. 
	Based on social identity theory, this thesis argues that delinquency arises out of a search for an alternative positive identity through " social creativity ", which is only possible through the group. Membership in a delinquent group or a delinquent social identity offers the delinquent a sense of " positive distinctiveness " which is derived from the rejection, redefinition and reversal of conventional norms. It is only through a social identity where members perceive each other as interchangeable and share an interdependency, that such a reversal receives social validation, and that members achieve a sense of self-consistency which becomes part of their reputation. The second study in this thesis confirms that delinquents show a relative preference for a group strategy of derogation of the outgroup for coping with negative social comparison, rather than one which involves an  individual strategy of competition, and that this group strategy is more likely to enhance their self-esteem. Delinquents' tendency to reverse conventional norms is demonstrated in the third study of the thesis, which also revealed that this reversal is evident only when delinquents are compared to non delinquents, and that this rejection is not total. These findings not only provide support for Cohen's subcultural theory of delinquency but also that of Sykes and Matza who argue that delinquents drift in and out of such behaviours. 
	In fact, this thesis suggests that this drift can be explained in terms of a shift in the salience of identity. Because the delinquent identity is a social identity, it is  variable and context-dependent. Differences in attitudes towards authority, rationalizations against guilt and self-derogation can be explained by differences in the salience of the delinquent social identity. The last three studies of the thesis provide evidence of these variations with both self-report and incarcerated delinquents.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">juvenile delinquency</field><field name="subject">social status</field><field name="subject">social identity</field><field name="subject">delinquent identity</field><field name="subject">delinquent peer groups</field><field name="subject">self-categorization</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010731.175324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electron Transfer Reactivity, Synthesis, Surface Chemistry and Liquid-Membrane Transport of  Sarcophagine-Type Poly-Aza Cage Complexes</field><field name="creator">Walker, Glen William</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.

The kinetics for outer-sphere electron transfer between a series of cobalt(II) poly-aza
cage ligand complexes and the iron(III) sarcophagine-type hexa-aza cage complex,
[Fe(sar)]3+ (sar = 3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaazabicyclo[6.6.6]icosane), in aqueous solution
have been investigated and the Marcus correlation is used to deduce the electron self-exchange rate constant for the [Fe(sar)]3+/2+ couple from these cross-reactions. The
deduced electron self-exchange rate constant is in relatively good agreement with the
experimentally determined rate constant (k ex calc = 4 &#180; 10 5 M -1 s -1 ; k ex   obs = 8 &#180; 10 5 M -1
s -1 ). The successful application of the Marcus correlation to the electron transfer
reactions of the Fe cage complex is consistent with the trend for the Co, Mn, Ni and Ru
cage complexes which all follow the pattern of outer-sphere electron transfer reactivity
expected from the Marcus-Hush formalism. A comparison of predictions based on the
Marcus correlation with the experimentally determined kinetics of an extended series of
cross reactions involving cobalt cage complexes with low-spin-high-spin cobalt(III)/(II)
couples shows that electron transfer reactions involving large spin changes at the metal
centre are not necessarily anomalous in the context of the adiabatic Marcus-Hush
formalism. The results of this study also show that for suitable systems, the Marcus
correlation can be used to reliably calculate the rates of outer-sphere electron transfer
cross-reactions, with reaction free-energy changes spanning the range -6 to -41 kJ mol -1
and many different combinations of initial electronic configurations. Together, these
results provide a coherent and internally consistent set of experimental data in support
of the Marcus-Hush formalism for outer-sphere electron transfer. The results with the
caged metal-ion systems also highlight the special nature of the mechanism of electron
transfer in reactions of metal-aqua ions.
&#182;
A new range of symmetrically disubstituted hexa-aza sarcophagine-type cage
ligand complexes are prepared in this study by the base-catalysed co-condensation of
formaldehyde and a-methylene aliphatic aldehydes with cobalt(III) tris(1,2-diamine)
precursors in acetonitrile solution. Encapsulation reactions based on the condensation
of the weak carbon di-acids propanal and decanal with formaldehyde and the cobalt(III)
tris(1,2-diamine) precursors, [Co(en)3 ] 3+ (en = 1,2-ethanediamine) and D-lel3 -[Co((R,
R)-chxn)3 ] 3+ (chxn = 1,2-cyclohexanediamine), yield unsaturated cobalt(III) cage
complexes with an endo-cyclic imine function in each cap. The Co III -coordinated endo-cyclic imine units of the cage ligands are reactive electrophiles that are readily reduced
by the BH4 - ion to give the corresponding symmetrically di-substituted hexaamine
macrobicyclic cage ligands. The nitromethane carbanion is also shown to add at the
endo-cyclic imine function to yield a novel nitromethylated cage ligand complex. The
latter reaction introduces a new method for the regioselective functionalisation of cage
ligands at sites removed from the more commonly substituted bridgehead positions.
The capping of cobalt(III) tris(1,2-diamine)-type complexes with weak CH-acids
developed in this study introduces a new and more direct route to symmetrically di-substituted cage ligand complexes.
&#182;
A new range of cobalt(III) surfactant cage complexes, with linear octyl, dodecyl
and hexadecyl hydrocarbon chains built directly into the bridgehead structure of the
cage ligand, have been prepared by the base catalysed co-condensation of formaldehyde
and long chain aliphatic aldehydes with the tripodal cobalt(III) hexaamine complex,
[Co(sen)]3+ (sen = 4,4',4''-ethylidynetris(3-azabutan-1-amine)), in acetonitrile solution.
Chiral surfactant cage complexes are obtained by capping reactions beginning with the
optically pure L-[Co(sen)]3+ precursor complex. The cobalt(III) cage complexes with
octyl to hexadecyl substituents are surface active and reduce the surface tension of
water to levels approaching those of organic solvents. The dodecyl substituted cage
complex forms micelles in aqueous solution when the concentration of cage complex is
&gt; 1 &#180; 10 -3 mol dm -3 at 25 &#176;C. The cobalt(III) cage head-group of these surfactants
undergoes an electrochemically reversible one-electron reduction to the corresponding
cobalt(II) cage complex. The reduction potential of the surfactant head group can be
tuned to more positive potentials by replacing the bridgehead hydrocarbon chain
substituent with an ether linked hydrocarbon chain. The cobalt(III) surfactant-cage
complexes are biologically active and are lethal to the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta,
and the vaginal parasites, Trichomonas vaginalis and Tritrichomonas foetus. The
surfactant cage complexes also cause lysis in red-blood cell membranes at 
concentrations as low 10 -5 mol dm -3 . Their biological activity is linked to the high
head-group charge (3+) and size which cause distortions in biological membranes when
the membrane is treated with these molecules. The combination of the chemically
reversible outer-sphere redox properties of the cobalt cage head-groups and the chirality
of the head group introduces a new and possibly unique series of chiral surfactant
coordination complexes which are also redox active.
&#182;
The chiral carboxylic-acid ionophore, lasalocid A, has been used to promote the
selective supramolecular transport and extraction of cobalt(III) hexa-aza cage cations
and related tripodal cobalt(III) complexes. The conjugate base anion of lasalocid A
forms stoichiometric outer-sphere complexes with the cobalt(III) cage and tripod
complexes. These outer-sphere complexes are highly lipophilic and partition strongly
from water into a chloroform phase. The extraction of the dissymmetric cobalt(III)
complexes by the chiral polyether anion is enantioselective for many systems and
results in the partial resolution of initially racemic complexes in the aqueous phase. A
strong structural preference was demonstrated by the ionophore for symmetrically
disubstituted cobalt(III) hexa-aza cage cations with a D-absolute configuration of the
ligand about the metal-ion and an R configuration of the coordinated secondary amine
N-H groups. The lasalocid A anion was also shown to promote the transport of the
complexes, intact, across a chloroform bulk-liquid membrane against an NH4 +
concentration gradient. The transport of the cobalt(III) complexes was also
enantioselective and resulted in partial resolution of the initially racemic aqueous phase.
The most efficiently transported enantiomer of each complex was also the most
efficiently extracted isomer in all systems examined, consistent with a transport process
limited by interfacial diffusion. The magnitude of the enantiomer separation obtained in
some systems was sufficient to indicate that lasalocid A mediated extraction and
transport may become a practical method for the resolution of particular types of
kinetically-inert chiral metal-amine complexes.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sarcophagine cage</field><field name="subject">metal complex</field><field name="subject">electron transfer</field><field name="subject">synthesis</field><field name="subject">surface activity</field><field name="subject">biological activity</field><field name="subject">supramolecular transport</field><field name="subject">enantioselective</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010702.124104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FitzGerald's Rub&#225;iy&#225;t: A Victorian Invention</field><field name="creator">Zare-Behtash, Esmail</field><field name="description">This study was written in the belief that FitzGerald did not so much translate a poem as invent a persona based on the Persian astronomer and mathematician (but not poet) Omar Khayy&#225;m. This 'invention' opened two different lines of interpretation and scholarship, each forming its own idea of a 'real' Omar based on FitzGerald's invention. One line sees Omar as a hedonist and nihilist; the other as a mystic or Sufi. My argument first is that the historical Omar was neither the former nor the latter; second, FitzGerald's Rub&#225;iy&#225;t is a 'Victorian' product even if the raw material of the poem belongs to the eleventh-century Persia.
&#182;
The Introduction tries to find a place for the Rub&#225;iy&#225;t in the English nineteenth-century era.
&#182;
Chapter One sets FitzGerald's Rub&#225;iy&#225;t in perspective. First, it surveys the general background and context to the lives and careers of Edward FitzGerald and Omar Khayy&#225;m in order to show how FitzGerald's life was affected by some of the main concerns of the period; and that Omar was neither a hedonist nor a mystic; Secondly, it surveys four major critical studies which have generated different approaches to and emphases in the study and the translation of the rub&#225;iy&#225;t attributed to Omar Khayy&#225;m.
&#182;
Chapter Two reviews some examples of Persian language and literature as they were perceived by British readers and authors and shows the reception of Persian poetry in general up to and including the Victorian period. Then it traces FitzGerald's progress with Persian literature, showing how the other Persian poets he read influenced his understanding or 'creation' of the Rub&#225;iy&#225;t, and how he discarded the great Persian poets but retained Omar Khayy&#225;m as 'his property.'
&#182;
Chapter Three traces FitzGerald's career as a translator and attempts to give general characteristics of Victorian poetry to show how FitzGerald's version can be seen a Victorian product. Study of the poetry of the period shows the heterogeneity of Victorian poetry and FitzGerald's poem is another example of this multiplicity. The Rub&#225;iy&#225;t should be read as a revolt against general Victorian values: optimism, earnestness, Puritanism, and science development.
&#182;
Chapter Four accounts for the initial neglect of the poem and then for the popular reception of the Rub&#225;iy&#225;t by the Pre-Raphaelites and shows aspects in particular appealed to his contemporaries (like R. Browning) which, in turn, is a way of measuring the success of FitzGerald's 'Victorian' invention.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Edward FitzGerald</field><field name="subject">Rubaiyat</field><field name="subject">Omar Khayyam</field><field name="subject">Victorian</field><field name="subject">Persian</field><field name="subject">poetry</field><field name="subject">English literature</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010824.152643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond Familiar Territory:  Dissertation: De-centering the Centre

Five experiments were carried out in this thesis using progenies of two unrelated full-sib radiata pine crosses. The initial experiment (experiment 1) applied the bulked segregant analysis technique to determine whether RAPD analysis could be successfully extended to the development of molecular markers for NESTUR in radiata pine. The NESTUR values of 174 progenies of the full-sib family 12038 x 10946 were determined. Based on the genotypic analysis of the individuals, two quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling NESTUR were identified at ANOVA P-levels of 0.01-0.001. An absence of RAPD fragment markers generated by primers OPE-06 and OPA-10 was associated with low NESTUR values, while primer UBC-333 generated a 550 bp band that was associated with high NESTUR values. Linkage to components of NESTUR (increments in stem diameter and stem volume) was demonstrated for one of the QTL, while the other was unique to NESTUR, and not shared with the components. There was a significant interaction between the two QTLs. Presence of OPA-101200 locus appeared to inhibit expression of the QTL linked to UBC-333 [subscript 550].
&#182;
To further analyse the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling NESTUR, a linkage map was constructed from RAPD markers segregating in 93 haploid progeny of another full sib cross (30040 x 80121) (experiment 2). Two hundred and sixty-two (262) markers were mapped to 14 linkage groups of at least 7 markers, ranging in size from 39 to 183 cM. The 14 linkage groups covered approximately 1511 cM of genetic map distance.
&#182;
In experiment 3, the linkage map was used to map QTLs controlling NESTUR, as well as increments in seedling stem diameter, volume, and height and needle volume. Altogether, five putative QTLs were detected for NESTUR, with explained variation ranging from 9 to 22%. Of the five QTLs detected, 3 were coincidental with those for stem growth in height, diameter and volume. The two QTL positions that were unique to NESTUR were flanked by QTLs for the component traits. Together, effects of the five QTLs explained 48% of the total phenotypic variation for NESTUR.
&#182;
Ability of identified markers to predict the phenotype and seedlings with growth potential was assessed in the cross 30040 x 80121, using six RAPD markers associated with NESTUR at ANOVA P-levels of 0.01-0.001 (experiment 4). The correlation between observed NESTUR and predicted values was 0.70. Differences in observed vs. predicted values were not large and did not indicate serious misclassifications, such as classification of an upper ranking individual into the lower group, or vice versa. 
&#182;
Over a two-year growth period, the ability of NESTUR to predict stem growth was strongly affected by seedling age. In contrast, markers linked to NESTUR showed a consistent ability to predict stem growth, irrespective of seedling age. Compared with the top 1% of the original population, seedlings selected for their genotypic values showed a higher stem volume growth of 103% in the first year, and 76% in the second year.
&#182;
The expression of QTLs for stem volume, stem diameter, height, number of branches, number of whorls, and branches/whorl were compared at 5, 12, and 24 months of age. Two QTLs detected for height showed contrasting expression over two years, one was gradually reduced from LOD of 2.70 to 0.43 and the other increased from 1.12 to 2.45. Compared with the pattern observed for height, LOD scan profiles for diameter and volume showed less temporal change of peaks, suggesting that the genetic control for height growth is probably more unstable than that of diameter. QTLs controlling the phenotype at the time of measurement (ie the final phenotype) showed similar magnitude of effects on that trait's respective increments (or growth rate).</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic mapping</field><field name="subject">quantitative trait loci</field><field name="subject">stem growth</field><field name="subject">radiata pine</field><field name="subject">needle-to-stem unit ratio</field><field name="subject">NESTUR</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010822.164445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing Efficient Parallel Algorithms for Graph Problems</field><field name="creator">Liang, Weifa</field><field name="description">Graph algorithms are concerned with the algorithmic aspects of solving graph problems. The problems are motivated from and have application to diverse areas of computer science, engineering and other disciplines. Problems arising from these areas of application are good candidates for parallelization since they often have both intense computational needs and stringent response time requirements. Motivated by these concerns, this thesis investigates parallel algorithms for these kinds of graph problems that have at least one of the following properties: the problems involve some type of dynamic updates; the sparsification technique is applicable; or the problems are closely related to communications network issues. The models of parallel computation used in our studies are the Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) model and the practical interconnection network models such as meshes and hypercubes. 
&#182;
Consider a communications network which can be represented by a graph G = (V;E), where V is a set of sites (processors), and E is a set of links which are used to connect the sites (processors). In some cases, we also assign weights and/or directions to the edges in E. Associated with this network, there are many problems such as (i) whether the network is k-edge (k-vertex) connected withfixed k; (ii) whether there are k-edge (k-vertex) disjoint paths between u and v for a pair of given vertices u and v after the network is dynamically updated by adding and/or deleting an edge etc; (iii) whether the sites in the network can communicate with each other when some sites and links fail; (iv) identifying the first k edges in the network whose deletion will result in the maximum increase in the routing cost in the resulting network for fixed k; (v) how to augment the network at optimal cost with a given feasible set of weighted edges such that the augmented network is k-edge (k-vertex) connected; (vi) how to route messages through the network efficiently. In this thesis we answer the problems mentioned above by presenting efficient parallel algorithms to solve them. As far as we know, most of the proposed algorithms are the first ones in the parallel setting.
&#182;
Even though most of the problems concerned in this thesis are related to communications networks, we also study the classic edge-coloring problem. The outstanding difficulty to solve this problem in parallel is that we do not yet know whether or not it is in NC. In this thesis we present an improved parallel algorithm for the problem which needs [bigcircle]([bigtriangleup][superscript 4.5]log [superscript 3] [bigtriangleup] log n + [bigtriangleup][superscript 4] log [superscript 4] n) time using [bigcircle](n[superscript 2][bigtriangleup] + n[bigtriangleup][superscript 3]) processors, where n is the number of vertices and [bigtriangleup] is the maximum vertex degree. Compared with a previously known result on the same model, we improved by an [bigcircle]([bigtriangleup][superscript 1.5]) factor in time. The non-trivial part is to reduce this problem to the edge-coloring update problem. We also generalize this problem to the approximate edge-coloring problem by giving a faster parallel algorithm for the latter case.
&#182;
Throughout the design and analysis of parallel graph algorithms, we also find a technique called the sparsification technique is very powerful in the design of efficient sequential and parallel algorithms on dense undirected graphs. We believe that this technique may be useful in its own right for guiding the design of efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for problems in other areas as well as in graph theory.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">efficient parallel algorithms</field><field name="subject">graph problems</field><field name="subject">graph algorithms</field><field name="subject">paralellization</field><field name="subject">dynamic updates</field><field name="subject">sparsification</field><field name="subject">communication networks</field><field name="subject">Parallel Random Access Machine</field><field name="subject">PRAM</field><field name="subject">meshes</field><field name="subject">hypercubes</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010829.114536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community Forestry: Paradoxes and Perspectives in Development Practice</field><field name="creator">Pulhin, Juan M</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with two related topics: core development objectives in community forestry in the Philippines, and the 'instruments' of development practice which have been used to address these objectives.  The two topics have currency beyond forestry development and are at the centre of a debate about sustainable development.  Community forestry aims to democratise resource access, alleviate poverty, and ensure the sustainability of forest resources.  Development practice, however, has often led to contradictory outcomes.  This paradox is examined from three perspectives: that of political economy, characteristics of practice, and the theory of rationalisation.
&#182;Four government-initiated community forestry projects in the Philippines are analysed.  These projects provide an historical trend on the development and refinements of the different techniques from the early 1980s to the present.  The relationship between the use of these techniques and improved outcomes in terms of the three core concerns is established.  Empirical findings from the cases suggest that there is no necessary relationship between the employment of these instruments and better development outcomes.  The attempt to democratise forest resource access through the use of access instruments has benefited the local elite and reinforced the government's jurisdiction over these resources.  Similarly, the use of appraisal and participatory planning techniques has homogenised views of the local community and advanced a centrally determined agenda in forest management that has worked against the alleviation of poverty.  Forest degradation is likely to continue, even with the incorporation of social factors into the concept of sustained-yield forest management.
&#182;The political economy perspective suggests that contradictory effects can be explained by the country's historical and political structure which has been shaped by an economically-driven development model and dominated by a more privileged sector.  Despite genuine efforts for reform, this perspective contends that community forestry projects and related development interventions will always be influenced by political forces, and their benefits will be captured by the privileged sector.  On the other hand, a focus on the characteristics of practice leads to the conclusion that contradictory effects are results of the limitations of these techniques, including their poor application.  This implies that the adverse effects may be addressed through the refinement of these techniques and improvements in their application.  Finally, the rationalisation thesis reveals that paradoxical effects are inherent in the use of these techniques.  This perspective posits that even with the apparent shift from a state-controlled to a more participatory and decentralised approach in forest management, such as community forestry, the instrumentalist nature associated with the application of these techniques reinforces the characteristics of homogeneity, technocracy, and centralism which are inclined to produced paradoxical outcomes.  
&#182;Both the political economy and the rationalisation perspectives provide a gloomy prognosis for community forestry.  However, the recognition of the dual problems of poverty and environmental degradation in the Philippine uplands, suggests that community forestry should not be abandoned.  Through a responsive mode of practice, there is room to move to improve the outcomes of the three central objectives.  But responsive practice is not a panacea for all development ills.  The process is bound to be slow, strategies will vary from one place to another, and success will be patchy.  But because responsive community forestry practice is not amenable to central programming and control, it is more likely to result in sustainable outcomes than the present approaches.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community forestry</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">development practice</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">rural poor</field><field name="subject">political economy</field><field name="subject">theory of rationalization</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010828.120905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotional Work: A Psychological View</field><field name="creator">Strazdins, Lyndall</field><field name="description">At work and in the family, people do emotional work to meet other people's emotional needs, improve their wellbeing, and maintain social harmony. Emotional work is unique and skilled work - it involves handling emotions and social relationships and its product is the change of feeling in others. &#182;
The thesis extends the work of Erickson and Wharton (1993, 1997) and England (1992, England &amp; Farkas, 1986) by adding a psychological perspective. Emotional work is defined in terms of behaviours. Three dimensions, companionship, help and regulation, distinguish whether positive or negative emotions in other people are the target of emotional work. Companionship builds positive emotions, whereas help and regulation repairs and regulates negative emotions. &#182;  
Two studies, the Public Service Study (n=448) and the Health Care Study (n=261), sample different work and family role contexts (spouse, parent, kinkeeper and friendship, manager, workmate and service roles). The Integrative Emotional Work (IEW) Inventory was developed to assess emotional work in these roles. &#182;
Emotional work is not just women's work. Younger people and those from ethnic minority backgrounds also do more emotional work. In contexts where it is not rewarded, emotional work is done by those with lower status. Emotional work is responsive and increases when other people are distressed. It is an aspect of the domestic division of labour, and influenced by workplace climate. Although personality is a factor, some determinants are modifiable. People do more emotional work when they have the skills, when it is saliently prescribed, and when it is rewarded and recognised. &#182;
Emotional work is costly to those who do it and combines in its effects across work and family roles. When people do emotional work they 'catch' emotions from others (Hatfield, Cacioppo, &amp; Rapson, 1994). Handling positive emotions in others improves wellbeing. However, handling negative emotions in others relates to a wide range of psychological health problems. These health costs are mitigated when emotional work is rewarded. Emotional work's devaluation sets in train social group differences in its performance, and confers both material (England &amp; Folbre, 1999) and health disadvantages on those who do it.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">emotional work</field><field name="subject">social support provision</field><field name="subject">emotional contagion</field><field name="subject">work stress</field><field name="subject">domestic work</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010906.171501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Fullerides</field><field name="creator">Fullagar, Wilfred Kelsham</field><field name="description">The closed shell structures of certain all-carbon fragments originally observed in mass spectroscopy experiments leads to the enhanced stability of these species, known as fullerenes, which have excited sufficient interest amongst chemists and physicists over the last decade to warrant the award of the 1996 Nobel Prize for Chemistry to their discoverers.
&#182;
Studies of the stability, symmetry, and consequent remarkable properties of fullerenes began in earnest in 1991 with the development of a technique enabling the production and purification of macroscopic quantities of material.  The best known and most widely studied fullerene is the truncated icosahedral C[subscript 60] molecule, which forms the basis of the present work.
&#182;
One important property of C[subscript 60] is that it forms salts with sufficiently electropositive species, such as the alkali metals.  The resulting salts contain C[subscript 60] anions and are known as fullerides.  Certain of these salts display metallic behaviour, and some superconduct at temperatures as high as 33 K.
&#182;
Three aspects of fulleride research are addressed in this work.  These are:  i) the preparation, crystal structure determination and superconductivity characterization of several new fullerides, particularly those including ammonia as an additional intercalant;  ii) the electronic structure of the C[superscript n-, subscript 60] (n = 1 - 6) anions, as probed by solution-phase near infrared absorption spectroscopy; and  iii) the molecular dynamics of a number of fullerides, superconducting and non-superconducting, by inelastic neutron scattering.
&#182;
This work has grown out of an Honours project also concerning C[subscript 60], the combined duration of the two studies covering essentially the entire history of this widely and competitively studied field.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fullerides</field><field name="subject">fullerenes</field><field name="subject">C60</field><field name="subject">superconductivity</field><field name="subject">near-infrared spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">neutron scattering</field><field name="subject">synchrotron</field><field name="subject">X-ray powder diffraction</field><field name="subject">vibrational analysis</field><field name="subject">liquid ammonia titration</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010831.150750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An other place: the Australian War Memorial in a Freirean framework</field><field name="creator">Styles, Catherine Anne</field><field name="description">My thesis is that museum exhibitions developed according to Freirean praxis would constitute a better learning opportunity for visitors, facilitate the process of evaluation, and enact the favoured museum principles of dialogic communication and community-building.
&#182;This project constitutes a cross-fertilisation of adult education, cultural studies and museum practice. In the last few decades, museum professional practice has become increasingly well informed by cultural critique. Many museum institutions have been moved to commit to building communities, but the question of how to do so via exhibition spaces is yet to be squarely addressed by the museum field. In this thesis I produce a detailed evaluation of a museum's informal learning program; and demonstrate the potential value of adult education theory and practice for enacting museums' commitment to dialogic communication and community-building.
&#182;To investigate the value of adult education praxis for museums, I consider the Australian War Memorial's signifying practice - the site and its exhibitions - as a program for informal learning. I conduct my analysis according to Ira Shor's (Freirean) method for engaging students in an extraordinary re-experience of an ordinary object. Shor's program calls for students to investigate the object through three stages of description, diagnosis and reconstruction. Respectively, I testify to my initial experience of the Memorial's program as a visitor, analyse its signification in national, international and historical contexts, and imagine an alternative means of signifying Australia's war memory. The resulting account constitutes a record of my learning process and a critical and constructive evaluation of the Memorial as a site for informal learning. It provides a single vision of what the Memorial is, what it means and how it could be reconstructed. But more importantly, my account demonstrates a program for simultaneously learning from the museum and learning about its signifying practice. This dual educational and evaluative method would mutually advantage a museum and its visiting public. In a museum that hosted a dialogic program, the exhibitions would invite evaluative responses that staff are otherwise at pains to generate. Concurrently, visitors would benefit because they would be engaging in a more critical and constructive learning process. In addition, the museum would be enacting the principle of dialogic communication that underpins the project of community-building.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Freirean praxis</field><field name="subject">museum practice</field><field name="subject">exhibits</field><field name="subject">public education</field><field name="subject">adult education</field><field name="subject">cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Australian War Memorial</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010904.111335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismogram synthesis for teleseismic events with application to source and structural studies</field><field name="creator">Marson-Pidgeon, Katrina Ann</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to develop procedures for the modelling and inversion of teleseismic P and S waveforms which are as flexible as possible. This flexibility is necessary in order to obtain accurate source depth and mechanism estimates for small to moderate size events, such as those that are relevant in the context of monitoring the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). &#182;
The main challenge for extending source depth and mechanism inversion methods to smaller events is to ensure that sufficiently accurate synthetic seismograms are available for comparison with observed records. An accurate phase-adaptive reflectivity method has therefore been developed, against which the performance of less computationally intensive approximations can be judged. The standard reflectivity method has been modified to allow for different crustal and upper mantle structures at the source and receiver, and the full effects of reverberations and conversions in these structures can be allowed for. Core reflections and refractions can also be included; these phases can become important at certain distance ranges. A slowness bundle approach has been developed, where a restricted slowness integration about the geometric slowness for the direct wave is undertaken at each frequency, allowing accurate results to be obtained whilst avoiding the expense of a full reflectivity technique. &#182; Inversion using the neighbourhood algorithm (NA) is performed for source depth, mechanism and time function, by modelling direct P and S and their surface reflections (pP, sP and pS, sS) at teleseismic distances. Both SV and SH data are exploited in the inversion, in addition to P data, in order to obtain improved constraints on the source mechanism, including any isotropic component. Good results are obtained using a simple generalised ray scheme, however, the use of a flexible derivative-free inversion method means that more accurate synthetics are able to be used in the inversion where appropriate. The NA makes use of only the rank of the data misfits, so that it is possible to employ any suitable misfit criterion. In the few cases where control on the source mechanism is limited, good depth resolution is still usually obtained. &#182;The structures near the source and receiver play an important role in shaping the detail of the teleseismic waveforms. Although reasonable results can be achieved with simple synthetics and a standard velocity model, significant improvement can be made by modifying the representation of structure near the source and receiver. In the case of sub-oceanic events it is important to allow for the effects of water reverberations. The crustal structure near the receiver can also have quite a large influence on the waveforms through reverberations and conversions. This is exploited in receiver function inversion, which is again accomplished using the NA approach.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">synthethic seismograms</field><field name="subject">teleseismic events</field><field name="subject">source depth and mechanism inversion</field><field name="subject">neighbourhood algorithm</field><field name="subject">receiver functions</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010925.152548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modal Analysis and Synthesis of Broadband Nearfield Beamforming Arrays</field><field name="creator">Abhayapala, P. Thushara D.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the design of a beamformer which can enhance desired signals in an environment consisting of broadband nearfield and/or farfield sources. The thesis contains: a formulation of a set of analysis tools which can provide insight into the intrinsic structure of array processing problems; a methodology for nearfield beamforming; theory and design of a general broadband beamformer; and a consideration of a coherent nearfield broadband adaptive beamforming problem. To a lesser extent, the source localization problem and background noise modeling are also treated.
&#182;:
A set of analysis tools called modal analysis techniques which can be used to a solve wider class of array signal processing problems, is first formulated. The solution to the classical wave equation is studied in detail and exploited in order to develop these techniques.
&#182;:
Three novel methods of designing a beamformer having a desired nearfield broadband beampattern are presented. The first method uses the modal analysis techniques to transform the desired nearfield beampattern to an equivalent farfield beampattern. A farfield beamformer is then designed for a transformed farfield beampattern which, if achieved, gives the desired nearfield pattern exactly. The second method establishes an asymptotic equivalence, up to complex conjugation, of two problems: (i) determining the nearfield performance of a farfield beampattern specification, and (ii) determining the equivalent farfield beampattern corresponding to a nearfield beampattern specification. Using this reciprocity relationship a computationally simple nearfield beamforming procedure is developed. The third method uses the modal analysis techniques to find a linear transformation between the array weights required to have the desired beampattern for farfield and nearfield, respectively.
&#182;:
An efficient parameterization for the general broadband beamforming problem is introduced with a single parameter to focus the beamformer to a desired operating radius and another set of parameters to control the actual broadband beampattern shape. This parameterization is derived using the modal analysis techniques and the concept of the theoretical continuous aperture.
&#182;:
A design of an adaptive beamformer to operate in a signal environment consisting of broadband nearfield sources, where some of interfering signals may be correlated with desired signal is also considered. Application of modal analysis techniques to noise modeling and broadband coherent source localization conclude the thesis.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nearfield beamforming</field><field name="subject">broadband beamforming</field><field name="subject">farfield</field><field name="subject">beamformer</field><field name="subject">arrays</field><field name="subject">array processing</field><field name="subject">modal analysis</field><field name="subject">microphone arrays</field><field name="subject">signal processing</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010905.121231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Empirical Examination of Physical Asset Expenditure Announcements in Australia: Growth Opportunities, Free Cash Flow and Capital Market Monitoring</field><field name="creator">Yeoh, Daniel Ghee Chong</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the stock market price variations associated with physical asset expenditure announcements in Australia.  With the exception of the study of Chen and Ho (1997) in Singapore, most capital expenditure studies in other markets investigate the announcement effects associated with changes in budgeted capital expenditures.  The fact that there is almost never any firm level capital budget announcement in Australia presents a unique opportunity to examine individual physical asset expenditure announcements.
&#182;
Three primary hypotheses pertaining to growth opportunities, free cash flow theory, and the capital market monitoring argument are developed and tested.  These arguments are formulated to explain the abnormal return variations associated with physical asset expenditure announcements.  The growth opportunities hypothesis posits that the abnormal returns at physical asset expenditure announcements are positively related to a firm's growth opportunities.  Both free cash flow theory and capital market monitoring hypothesis postulate that the abnormal returns at physical asset expenditure announcements are negatively related to a firm's free cash flow, and cash flow respectively.  Other control explanators are incorporated from the merger and takeovers literature.
&#182;
Event study methodology is used to examine the abnormal returns associated with physical asset expenditure announcements.  Two sets of data, intraday and daily, are used to investigate the market reaction.  Intraday returns are calculated on a time-weighted approach and two methods are used to calculate intraday abnormal returns.  The first method defines abnormal returns as the difference between actual returns and market returns.  The second method defines abnormal returns as the difference between market-adjusted returns and market-adjusted returns on a control portfolio.  Daily abnormal returns are calculated using the market model.
&#182;
Both univariate and multivariate analyses provide strong support for the growth opportunities hypothesis.  The results suggest the quality of firms' growth opportunities is the key variable determining the direction and magnitude of the abnormal returns at announcement.  Support for the capital monitoring argument and the free cash flow theory is mixed, generally with a lack of support.  The free cash flow variable is found to be significantly negatively related to abnormal returns, only when a finer dummy is used in the multivariate regression.  All other control variables are found to be insignificant in explaining the stock market variations once the growth opportunities variable is included in the regression.
&#182;
This thesis makes the following contributions.  First, this thesis presents the initial empirical evidence concerning physical asset expenditure announcements in Australia.  Second, the thesis shows that the quality of a firm's growth opportunities is the key factor in determining the direction and magnitude of abnormal returns around physical asset expenditure announcements.  These results also suggest that the equity market in Australia reacts to physical asset expenditure announcements which contain information pertaining to growth opportunities rather than the relative size of the physical asset expenditure transactions to firm value.  Third, support for the capital monitoring argument and the free cash flow theory is not strong.  Fourth, all other control variables are found to be insignificant in explaining the stock market variations once market to book ratio is included in the regression.  Fifth, the results suggest that prior research which fails to segregate market to book ratio and free cash flow proxy into finer partitions may have possibly underestimated the market to book and the free cash flow effects.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">physical asset expenditure announcements</field><field name="subject">australia</field><field name="subject">growth opportunities</field><field name="subject">free cash flow</field><field name="subject">capital market monitoring</field><field name="subject">stock market price variations</field><field name="subject">equity market</field><field name="subject">market to book ratio</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010702.160428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-smooth differential geometry of
pseudo-Riemannian manifolds:
Boundary and geodesic structure of gravitational wave
space-times in mathematical relativity</field><field name="creator">Fama, Christopher J.</field><field name="description">[No abstract supplied with this thesis - The first page (of three) of the Introduction follows]
&#182;
This thesis is largely concerned with the changing representations of 'boundary' or 'ideal' points of a 
pseudo-Riemannian manifold -- and our primary interest is in the space-times of general relativity. In particular, we are interested in the following question: What assumptions about the 'nature' of 'portions' of a certain 'ideal boundary' construction (essentially the 'abstract boundary' of Scott and Szekeres (1994)) allow us to define precisely the topological type of these 'portions', i.e., to show that different representations of this ideal boundary, corresponding to different embeddings of the manifold into others, have corresponding 'portions' that are homeomorphic?
&#182;
Certain topological properties of these 'portions' are preserved, even allowing for quite unpleasant properties of the metric (Fama and Scott 1995). These results are given in Appendix D, since they are not used elsewhere and, as well as representing the main portion of work undertaken under the supervision of Scott, which deserves recognition, may serve as an interesting example of the relative ease with which certain simple results about the abstract boundary can be obtained.
&#182;
An answer to a more precisely formulated version of this question appears very diffcult in general. However, we can give a rather complete answer in certain cases, where we dictate certain 'generalised regularity' requirements for our embeddings, but make no demands on the precise functional form of our metrics apart from these. For example, we get a complete answer to our question for abstract boundary sets which do not 'wiggle about' too much -- i.e., they satisfy a certain Lipschitz condition -- and through which the metric can be extended in a manner which is not required to be differentiable (C[superscript1]), but is continuous and non--degenerate. We allow similar freedoms on the interior of the manifold, thereby bringing gravitational wave space-times within our sphere of discussion. In fact, in the course of developing these results in progressively greater generality, we get, almost 'free', certain abilities to begin looking at geodesic structure on quite general pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. 
&#182;
It is possible to delineate most of this work cleanly into two major parts. Firstly, there are results which use classical geometric constructs and can be given for the original abstract boundary construction, which requires differentiability of both manifolds and metrics, and which we summarise below. The second -- and significantly longer -- part involves extensions of those constructs and results to more general metrics.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-smooth differential geometry</field><field name="subject">pseudo-Riemannian manifolds</field><field name="subject">boundary structure</field><field name="subject">geodesic structure</field><field name="subject">gravitational wave</field><field name="subject">space-times</field><field name="subject">mathematical relativity</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010907.161849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer Simulation of Biological Ion Channels</field><field name="creator">Hoyles, Matthew</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a project in which algorithms are developed for the rapid and accurate solution of Poisson's equation in the presence of a dielectric boundary and multiple point charges.  These algorithms are then used to perform Brownian dynamics simulations on realistic models of biological ion channels.  An iterative method of solution, in which the dielectric boundary is tiled with variable sized surface charge sectors, provides the flexibility to deal with arbitrarily shaped boundaries, but is too slow to perform Brownian dynamics.  An analytical solution is derived, which is faster and more accurate, but only works for a toroidal boundary.  Finally, a method is developed of pre-calculating solutions to Poisson's equation and storing them in tables.  The solution for a particular configuration of ions in the channel can then be assembled by interpolation from the tables and application of the principle of superposition.  This algorithm combines the flexibility of the iterative method with greater speed even than the analytical method, and is fast enough that channel conductance can be predicted.  The results of simulations for a model single-ion channel, based on the acetylcholine receptor channel, show that the narrow pore through the low dielectric strength medium of the protein creates an energy barrier which restricts the permeation of ions.  They further show that this barrier can be removed by dipoles in the neck of the channel, but that the barrier is not removed by shielding by counter-ions.  The results of simulations for a model multi-ion channel, based on a bacterial potassium channel, show that the model channel has conductance characteristics similar to those of real potassium channels.  Ions appear to move through the model multi-ion channel via rapid transitions between a series of semi-stable states.  This observation suggests a possible physical basis for the reaction rate theory of channel conductance, and opens up an avenue for future research.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer simulation</field><field name="subject">ion channels</field><field name="subject">conductance theories</field><field name="subject">electrostatics</field><field name="subject">Brownian dynamics</field><field name="subject">single-ion channel</field><field name="subject">multi-ion channel</field><field name="subject">Poisson's equation</field><field name="subject">dielectric boundary</field><field name="subject">potassium channel</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010702.135814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of laboratory models of the wind-driven ocean circulation</field><field name="creator">Kiss, Andrew Elek</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a numerical exploration of the dynamics governing 
rotating flow driven by a surface stress in the  " sliced cylinder "  model 
of Pedlosky &amp; Greenspan (1967) and Beardsley (1969), and its close 
relative, the  " sliced cone "  model introduced by Griffiths &amp; Veronis 
(1997). The sliced cylinder model simulates the barotropic wind-driven 
circulation in a circular basin with vertical sidewalls, using a depth 
gradient to mimic the effects of a gradient in Coriolis parameter. In the 
sliced cone the vertical sidewalls are replaced by an azimuthally uniform 
slope around the perimeter of the basin to simulate a continental slope. 
Since these models can be implemented in the laboratory, their dynamics 
can be explored by a complementary interplay of analysis and numerical 
and laboratory experiments. &#182;

In this thesis a derivation is presented of a generalised 
quasigeostrophic formulation which is valid for linear and moderately 
nonlinear barotropic flows over large-amplitude topography on an f-plane, 
yet retains the simplicity and conservation properties of the standard 
quasigeostrophic vorticity equation (which is valid only for small depth 
variations). This formulation is implemented in a numerical model based 
on a code developed by Page (1982) and Becker &amp; Page (1990). &#182;

The accuracy of the formulation and its implementation are confirmed by 
detailed comparisons with the laboratory sliced cylinder and sliced cone 
results of Griffiths (Griffiths &amp; Kiss, 1999) and Griffiths &amp; Veronis 
(1997), respectively. The numerical model is then used to provide insight 
into the dynamics responsible for the observed laboratory flows. In the 
linear limit the numerical model reveals shortcomings in the sliced cone 
analysis by Griffiths &amp; Veronis (1998) in the region where the slope and 
interior join, and shows that the potential vorticity is dissipated in an 
extended region at the bottom of the slope rather than a localised region 
at the east as suggested by Griffiths &amp; Veronis (1997, 1998). Welander's 
thermal analogy (Welander, 1968) is used to explain the linear 
circulation pattern, and demonstrates that the broadly distributed 
potential vorticity dissipation is due to the closure of geostrophic 
contours in this geometry. &#182;

The numerical results also provide insight into features of the flow at 
finite Rossby number. It is demonstrated that separation of the western 
boundary current in the sliced cylinder is closely associated with a 
 " crisis "  due to excessive potential vorticity dissipation in the viscous 
sublayer, rather than insufficient dissipation in the outer western 
boundary current as suggested by Holland &amp; Lin (1975) and Pedlosky 
(1987). The stability boundaries in both models are refined using the 
numerical results, clarifying in particular the way in which the western 
boundary current instability in the sliced cone disappears at large 
Rossby and/or Ekman number. A flow regime is also revealed in the sliced 
cylinder in which the boundary current separates without reversed flow, 
consistent with the potential vorticity  " crisis "  mechanism. In addition 
the location of the stability boundary is determined as a function of the 
aspect ratio of the sliced cylinder, which demonstrates that the flow is 
stabilised in narrow basins such as those used by Beardsley (1969, 1972, 
1973) and Becker &amp; Page (1990) relative to the much wider basin used by 
Griffiths &amp; Kiss (1999). &#182;

Laboratory studies of the sliced cone by Griffiths &amp; Veronis (1997) 
showed that the flow became unstable only under anticyclonic forcing. It 
is shown in this thesis that the contrast between flow under cyclonic and 
anticyclonic forcing is due to the combined effects of the relative 
vorticity and topography in determining the shape of the potential 
vorticity contours. The vorticity at the bottom of the sidewall smooths 
out the potential vorticity contours under cyclonic forcing, but distorts 
them into highly contorted shapes under anticyclonic forcing. In 
addition, the flow is dominated by inertial boundary layers under 
cyclonic forcing and by standing Rossby waves under anticyclonic forcing 
due to the differing flow direction relative to the direction of Rossby 
wave phase propagation. The changes to the potential vorticity structure 
under strong cyclonic forcing reduce the potential vorticity changes 
experienced by fluid columns, and the flow approaches a steady free 
inertial circulation. In contrast, the complexity of the flow structure 
under anticyclonic forcing results in strong potential vorticity changes 
and also leads to barotropic instability under strong forcing. &#182;

The numerical results indicate that the instabilities in both models 
arise through supercritical Hopf bifurcations. The two types of 
instability observed by Griffiths &amp; Veronis (1997) in the sliced cone are 
shown to be related to the western boundary current instability and 
 " interior instability "  identified by Meacham &amp; Berloff (1997). The 
western boundary current instability is trapped at the western side of 
the interior because its northward phase speed exceeds that of the 
fastest interior Rossby wave with the same meridional wavenumber, as 
discussed by Ierley &amp; Young (1991). &#182;

Numerical experiments with different lateral boundary conditions are also 
undertaken. These show that the flow in the sliced cylinder is 
dramatically altered when the free-slip boundary condition is used 
instead of the no-slip condition, as expected from the work of Blandford 
(1971). There is no separated jet, because the flow cannot experience a 
potential vorticity  " crisis "  with this boundary condition, so the western 
boundary current overshoots and enters the interior from the east. In 
contrast, the flow in the sliced cone is identical whether no-slip, 
free-slip or super-slip boundary conditions are applied to the horizontal 
flow at the top of the sloping sidewall, except in the immediate vicinity 
of this region. This insensitivity results from the extremely strong 
topographic steering near the edge of the basin due to the vanishing 
depth, which demands a balance between wind forcing and Ekman pumping on 
the upper slope, regardless of the lateral boundary condition. The 
sensitivity to the lateral boundary condition is related to the 
importance of lateral friction in the global vorticity balance. The 
integrated vorticity must vanish under the no-slip condition, so in the 
sliced cylinder the overall vorticity budget is dominated by lateral 
viscosity and Ekman friction is negligible. Under the free-slip condition 
the Ekman friction assumes a dominant role in the dissipation, leading to 
a dramatic change in the flow structure. In contrast, the much larger 
depth variation in the sliced cone leads to a global vorticity balance in 
which Ekman friction is always dominant, regardless of the boundary 
condition.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wind driven ocean circulation</field><field name="subject">Rotating flow</field><field name="subject">surface stress</field><field name="subject">quasigeostrophic formulation</field><field name="subject">nonlinear barotropic flow over topography</field><field name="subject">topographic steering</field><field name="subject">continental slopes</field><field name="subject">western boundary current separation</field><field name="subject">western boundary current instability</field><field name="subject">free inertial circulation</field><field name="subject">laboratory models</field><field name="subject">numerical model</field><field name="subject">sliced cylinder</field><field name="subject">geophysical fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">physical oceanography</field><field name="subject">ocean general circulation</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20011018.115707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Theoretical Approach to Molecular Design: Planar-Tetracoordinate Carbon</field><field name="creator">Rasmussen, Danne Rene</field><field name="description">A number of novel hydrocarbon cage systems have been designed and characterized using ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the MP2 and B3-LYP levels. In particular,equilibrium structures for five families of molecules, hemialkaplanes, hemispiroalkaplanes, alkaplanes, spiroalkaplanes and dimethanospiroalkaplanes, have been examined in detail with the aim of designing a saturated hydrocarbon with a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom and with a view to identifying appropriate synthetic targets.
&#182;
The hemialkaplanes and hemispiroalkaplanes are constructed from a spiropentane or neopentane subunit, respectively, which is capped by a cyclic hydrocarbon. The hemispiroalkaplanes are predicted to contain a pyramidal-tetracoordinate carbon atom possessing a lone pair of electrons. Protonation at this apical carbon atom is found to be highly favorable,  resulting in a remarkably high basicity for a saturated hydrocarbon. The proton affinities of the hemispiroalkaplanes are calculated to be more than 1170 kJ mol[superscript -1] , even greater than those for the diamine "proton sponges". 
&#182;
The alkaplanes and the spiroalkaplanes, which are constructed by bicapping a neopentane or spiropentane subunit, respectively, with a pair of cyclic hydrocarbons, show unprecedented flattening of a tetracoordinate carbon atom. Linking the spiroalkaplane caps with methano bridges gives the dimethanospiroalkaplanes, two of which, dimethanospirooctaplane and dimethanospirobinonaplane, achieve exact planarity at the central carbon atom. They are the first neutral saturated hydrocarbons predicted to contain an exactly planartetracoordinate carbon atom. This has been achieved through structural constraints alone. The electronic structure at the central carbon atom results in a highest occupied molecular orbital corresponding to a p-type lone pair. Consequently, the adiabatic ionization energies for octaplane, spirooctaplane and dimethanospirooctaplane (approximately 5 eV) are predicted to be similar to those of lithium and sodium - incredibly low for a saturated hydrocarbon.
&#182;
Some consideration has been given to likely pathways for unimolecular decomposition for all species. Predicted structures, heats of formation and strain energies for all the novel hydrocarbons are also detailed. Tetramethylhemispirooctaplane and dimethanospirobinonaplane are identified as the preferred synthetic targets.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular design</field><field name="subject">planar-tetracoordinate carbon</field><field name="subject">saturated hydrocarbon</field><field name="subject">alkaplanes</field><field name="subject">basicity</field><field name="subject">cage systems</field><field name="subject">planarity</field><field name="subject">pyramidal-tetracoordinate carbon</field><field name="subject">ab initio calculations</field><field name="subject">cage hydrocarbons</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20010702.115616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytosine methylation, methyltransferases and flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="creator">Genger, Ruth Kathleen</field><field name="description">Environmental signals such as photoperiod and temperature provide plants with seasonal information, allowing them to time flowering to occur in favourable conditions.  Most ecotypes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana flower earlier in long photoperiods and after prolonged exposure to cold (vernalization).

Arabidopsis plants transformed with an antisense construct to the cytosine methyltransferase METI (AMT) showed significant decreases in methylation.  AMT plants flowered significantly earlier than unvernalized wildtype plants, and the promotion of flowering correlated with the extent of demethylation.  The flowering time of mutants with decreased DNA methylation (ddm1) was promoted only in growth conditions in which wildtype plants showed a vernalization response, suggesting that the early flowering response to demethylation operated specifically through the vernalization pathway.  
&#182;
The AMT construct was crossed into two late flowering mutants that differed in vernalization responsiveness.  Demethylation promoted flowering of the vernalization responsive mutant fca, but not of the fe mutant, which has only a slight vernalization response.  This supports the hypothesis that demethylation is a step in the vernalization pathway.
&#182;
The role of gibberellic acid (GA) in the early flowering response to demethylation was investigated by observing the effect of the gai mutation, which disrupts the GA signal transduction pathway, on flowering time in plants with demethylated DNA.  The presence of a single gai allele delayed flowering, suggesting that the early flowering response to demethylation requires a functional GA signal transduction pathway, and that demethylation increases GA levels or responses, directly or indirectly.  
&#182;
In most transgenic lines, AMT-mediated demethylation did not fully substitute for vernalization.  This indicates that part of the response is not affected by METI-mediated methylation, and may involve a second methyltransferase or a factor other than methylation.  A second Arabidopsis methyltransferase, METIIa, was characterized and compared to METI.  The two genes are very similar throughout the coding region, and share the location of their eleven introns, indicating that they diverged relatively recently.  Both are transcribed in all tissues and at all developmental stages assayed, but the level of expression of METI is significantly higher than that of METIIa.  The possible functions of METI, METIIa, and other Arabidopsis cytosine methyltransferase genes recently identified are discussed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cytosine methylation</field><field name="subject">methyltransferases</field><field name="subject">flowering</field><field name="subject">vernalization</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20011127.115231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phase Transitions of Long-Chain N-Alkanes at Interfaces</field><field name="creator">Maeda, Nobuo</field><field name="description">An experimental study of phase transitions of long-chain n-alkanes induced by the effect of interfaces is described.
&#182;
The phase behaviour of long-chain n-alkanes (carbon number 14, 16, 17, 18) adsorbed at isolated mica surfaces and confined between two mica surfaces has been studied in the vicinity of and down to several degrees below the bulk melting points, Tm. Using the Surface Force Apparatus we have measured the thickness of alkane films adsorbed from vapour (0.97 [equal to or greater-than] p/p[subscript o] [equal to or greater-than] 0.997), studied capillary condensation transition, subsequent growth of capillary condensates between two surfaces, and phase transitions in both the adsorbed films and the condensates. By measuring the growth rate of the capillary condensates we have identified a transition in the lateral mobility of molecules in the adsorbed films on isolated mica surfaces.  This transition to greater mobility occurs slightly above Tm for n-hexadecane, n-heptadecane and n-octadecane but several degrees below Tm for n-tetradecane, and is accompanied by a change in wetting behaviour and a measurable decrease in adsorbed film thickness for n-heptadecane and n-octadecane. Capillary condensates that form below Tm remain liquid, but may freeze if the degree of confinement is reduced by separation of the mica surfaces.  An increase in the area of the liquid-vapour interface relative to that of the liquid-mica interface facilitates freezing in the case of the long-chain alkanes, which show surface freezing at the liquid-vapour interface.
&#182;
Although thermodynamic properties of the surface freezing transition have been rather well documented, the kinetics involved in formation of such ordered monolayers has so far received very little attention. We studied the surface tension of n-octadecane as a function of temperature in the vicinity of Tm, using the static Wilhelmy plate and the dynamic maximum bubble pressure methods. The two methods give different results on cooling paths, where nucleation of the surface ordered phase is involved, but agree on heating paths, where both methods measure properties of the equilibrium surface phase. On cooling paths, the surface of bubbles may supercool below the equilibrium surface freezing temperature. The onset of surface freezing is marked by a sharp drop in the surface tension. The transition is accompanied by an increased stability of the films resulting in longer bubble lifetimes at the liquid surface, which suggests that the mechanical properties of the surfaces change from liquid-like to solid-like. Our results suggest occurrence of supercooling of the monolayer itself.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface phase transition</field><field name="subject">surface freezing</field><field name="subject">surface ordering</field><field name="subject">surface

This research is driven by the need to understand and prevent the heterosexual sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS. I focus on young heterosexual men&#146;s understandings and experiences of condom use and non-use, given that condoms are a key means of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV. 
&#182;
I conducted in-depth interviews with seventeen men, using these to explore sexual practices and the meanings and sociosexual relations through which these are organised. This &#145;close-focus&#146; qualitative approach is oriented to assessing the interplay between men&#146;s personal experience and the social relations of sexuality and gender. I draw on empirical feminist investigations of women&#146;s relation to HIV/AIDS, the critical scholarship on men and masculinities and masculine sexualities, and sociological scholarship on sexualities. 
&#182;
My research finds that young heterosexual men emphasise five themes in accounting for their non-use of condoms. First, men stress the risk of pregnancy rather than the risks of HIV or other sexually transmitted infections, and they respond to the former risk by relying on their partners&#146; use of the Pill. Second, men perceive that wearing condoms decreases their penile sensation and that condoms are difficult to use. Third, men find that the &#147;heat of the moment&#148; of sexual episodes, their spontaneous and passionate ambience, makes it hard to incorporate condoms and, indeed, condoms destroy this &#147;moment&#148;. Fourth, men privilege &#147;trust&#148; as fundamental to their sexual involvements, and they quickly define involvements as &#147;relationships&#148; and therefore as trusting and monogamous, such that they abandon condoms. Fifth, men believe that they are very unlikely to contract HIV because they see their social circles, institutions, the heterosexual community or heterosexual sex per se as safe and free of HIV/AIDS, so there is no need to wear condoms. 
&#182;
I compare these findings with the argument in the AIDS literature that heterosexual men&#146;s use of condoms is limited by several understandings associated with masculine sexuality and masculinity. I argue that these understandings do not appear to be widespread as the literature claims, some work in contradictory ways and are compatible with safe sex, and other sets of meanings are more influential in heterosexual men&#146;s unsafe sex. Men do not represent wearing condoms as feminising or homosexualising, nor as masculine. I conclude by exploring how heterosexual men could be encouraged to use condoms through appeals to notions associated with masculinity and masculine sexuality.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Men</field><field name="subject">Heterosexuality</field><field name="subject">Masculinity</field><field name="subject">Sexuality</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">sexual practices</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20011205.151419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disinfection by-products in drinking water and genotoxic changes in urinary bladder epithelial cells</field><field name="creator">Ranmuthugala, Geethanjali Piyawadani</field><field name="description">There is much debate on the carcinogenic potential of disinfection by-products (DBP) in chlorinated water supplies.  Until recently, epidemiological studies have been limited in their ability to examine accurately the risk of cancer with exposure to environmental carcinogens.  This has largely been due to the long latency periods associated with cancer development, and the difficulties in accurately estimating chronic exposure.  Although there is evidence, from predominantly case-control studies, of increased bladder cancer with exposure to chlorinated water supplies, the evidence is inconclusive.  
&#182;
In an attempt to determine the carcinogenic potential of trihalomethanes (THMs) in chlorinated water, this study utilises DNA damage to bladder cells, evident as micronuclei, as a pre-clinical outcome measure.  Using a pre-clinical marker helps overcome some of the limitations associated with long latency periods. The study improves on previous studies by estimating exposure to DBP at an individual level, and takes into consideration ingestion, inhalation and dermal exposure.  
&#182;
A cohort study was undertaken in three Australian communities.  The Bungendore (NSW) water supply was not chlorinated thereby providing a community unexposed to DBPs from chlorinated water.  Canberra (ACT) and Adelaide (SA) had intermediate and relatively higher (but still within NHMRC guideline levels) of DBPs in the reticulation system.  Trihalomethane levels in reticulated water (external dose) and in urine (internal dose) were used as exposure indices.  As well, intake dose was computed by adjusting external dose for individual variations in ingestion and bathing.  The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of micronuclei in bladder epithelial cells.  A DNA index derived from flow cytometry was also used to estimate DNA damage in bladder cells.  Associations between exposure and outcome were estimated using Poisson regression models, having identified and adjusted for interaction effects and confounders.  
&#182;
A total of 529 participants were eligible to participate, of which 348 (65.8%) completed all aspects of the study.  Analysis was limited to the 228 participants (65.53% of those who completed the study) who had slides suitable for micronuclei scoring.  One hundred and forty three (63%) of the 228 participants were from the exposed communities, while 85 (37%) were from the unexposed community.  This sample exceeded the estimated 50 per group required to detect a relative risk of 1.4, with a significance level of 0.05 and 80% power.      
&#182;
External dose for total THM for the two chlorinated (exposed) communities ranged from 37.75 to 157.25 mg/l.  Intake dose estimated by fluid intake diary ranged from 2.9 to 469.5 mg/l, while a retrospective questionnaire estimated intake dose to range from 0 to 409.4 mg/l.  Internal dose (urine levels) of total THM for the same two communities ranged from 0 to 6.82 mg/l.  Adjusted risk estimate for DNA damage to bladder cells (using the micronuclei assay) when total THM was assessed by available dose was 1.0002 (0.997 to 1.003), by intake dose estimated by fluid intake diary was 1.0001 (0.998 to 1.002), by intake dose estimated by questionnaire was 1.001 (0.999 to 1.003), and by internal dose was 1.05 (0.89 to 1.24).  Using DNA index from flow cytometry as the outcome measure also did not identify significant associations, except when exposure was assessed as available dose of total THM (RR=1.0042; 1.0003 to 1.0081).  
&#182;
The results suggest that THM levels are not significantly associated with DNA damage to bladder cell.  This supports suggestions of THMs being non-genotoxic.  Further work is required to assess the relationship between THM and the more mutagenic compounds, and to assess the carcinogenicity of the more mutagenic compounds at concentrations occurring in drinking water.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disinfection by-products</field><field name="subject">chlorination</field><field name="subject">bladder cancer</field><field name="subject">micronuclei</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20011207.110344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Convection, turbulent mixing and salt
fingers</field><field name="creator">Wells, Mathew Graeme</field><field name="description">In this thesis I address several topics concerning the interaction of convection and density stratification in oceans and lakes. I present experimental and theoretical investigations of the
interaction between a localized buoyancy source and a heat flux through a horizontal boundary,
and of the interactions between salt fingers and intermittent turbulence or shear.
&#182;
An extensive series of laboratory experiments were used to quantify the stratification and circulation that result from the combined presence of a localized buoyancy source and a heat flux through a horizontal boundary. Previous studies found that convection in the form of a turbulent buoyant plume tends to produce a stable density stratification, whereas the distributed flux from a horizontal boundary tends to force vigorous overturning and to produce well-mixed layers. A new result of this thesis is that a steady density profile, consisting of a mixed layer and a stratified layer, can exist when the plume buoyancy flux is greater than the distributed flux. When the two fluxes originate from the same boundary, the steady state involves a balance between the rate at which the mixed layer deepens due to entrainment on the one hand and vertical advection of the stratified water far from the plume (due to the volume flux acquired by entrainment) on the other hand. There is a monotonic relationship between the normalized mixed layer depth and flux ratio R (boundary flux/plume flux) for 0 &lt; R &gt; 1, and the whole tank overturns for R &gt;  1. The stable density gradient in the stratified region is primarily due to the buoyancy from the plume and for R &gt; 0 there is a small increase in the gradient due to entrainment of buoyancy from the mixed layer. For the case of fluxes from a plume located at one boundary and a uniform heat flux from the opposite boundary the shape of the density
profile is that given by Baines &amp; Turner (1969), with the gradient reduced by a factor (1 + R) due to the heating. Thus, when R &lt; - 1 there is no stratified region and the whole water column
overturns. When 0 &gt; R &gt; - 1, the constant depth of the convecting layer is determined by the
Monin-Obukhov scale in the outflow from the plume.
&#182;
One application of these laboratory experiments is to surface cooling in lakes and reservoirs
that have shallow sidearms. During prolonged periods of atmospheric cooling, gravity currents can form in these sidearms and as the currents descend into the deeper waters they are analogous to isolated plumes. This can result in stratification at the base of a lake and an upwelling of cold water. Away from the shallow regions, surface cooling leads to a mixed surface layer. The depth of this layer will be steady when the rate of upwelling balances the rate at which the mixed layer deepens by turbulent entrainment. A series of laboratory experiments designed to model the depth distribution of a lake with a shallow sidearm showed that the steady depth of the mixed layer depended on the ratio of the area of the shallow region to the area of the deep region. Significant stratification resulted only when the reservoir had shallow regions that account for more than 50 % of the surface area. The depth of the surface mixed layer also depended on the ratio of the depths of the shallow and deep regions and no significant stratification forms if this ratio is greater than 0.5. These results are in good agreement with observations of circulation and stratification during long periods of winter cooling
from Chaffey reservoir, Australia. Theoretical time scales are also developed to predict the minimum duration of atmospheric cooling that can lead the development of stratification.
&#182;
In the second part of this thesis, I report a series of laboratory experiments which are designed to investigate the fine structure and buoyancy fluxes that result from salt finger convection in the presence of shear and intermittent turbulence. We find that, when salt finger convection in deep linear gradients is superposed with a depth-dependent spatially periodic shear, variations in the density profile develop on the same wavelength as the shear. The laboratory experiments presented in this thesis were carried out in a continuous density gradient with a spatially periodic shear produced by exciting a low-frequency baroclinic mode of vertical wavelength 60 mm. The density gradient consisted of opposing salt and sugar gradients favourable to salt fingers (an analogue to the oceanic heat/salt system). Where the shearing was large the salt finger buoyancy fluxes were small. Changes in salinity gradient due to the resulting flux divergence were self-amplifying until a steady state was reached in which the spatial variations in the ratio of salt and sugar gradients were such that the flux divergence vanished. Thus, along with reducing the mean salt finger buoyancy flux, a spatially varying shear can also lead to the formation of density structure.
&#182;
In the ocean intermittent turbulence can occur in isolated patches in salt finger-favourable
regions. I present new results from laboratory experiments in which a partially mixed patch
was produced in deep linear concentration gradients favourable to salt finger convection. Salt fingers give rise to an &#147;up gradient&#148; flux of buoyancy which can reduce the density gradient
in a partially mixed patch. This can then lead to overturning convection of the partially mixed
patch if a) the ratio of T and S gradients, R\rho =aTz/_ /betaSz, is near one, b) if turbulence results in
a nearly well-mixed patch and c) the patch thickness is large enough that convective eddies are
able to transport T and S faster than salt fingers. Once overturning occurs, subsequent turbulent
entrainment can lead to growth of the patch thickness. Experimental results agree well with
the theoretical prediction that h= \surd 8h B/N2 t, where h is the patch thickness, t is time, h is
the mixing efficiency of turbulent entrainment, B is the buoyancy flux of the salt fingers and N
is the buoyancy frequency of the ambient gradient region. This thickening is in contrast to the
collapse that a partially mixed patch would experience due to lateral intrusion in a very wide
tank. In regions of the ocean that contain salt fingers there is the possibility that, after a period
of initial collapse, an intrusion could enter a regime where the rate of collapse in the vertical is
balanced by the growth rate due to turbulent entrainment from the salt fingers buoyancy flux,
thus tending to maintain the rate of lateral spread.
&#182;
A further series of laboratory experiments quantified the buoyancy fluxes that result from
salt fingers and intermittent turbulence. A continuous density gradient, favourable to salt finger
convection, was stirred intermittently by an array of vertical rods that move horizontally back
and forth along the tank at a constant velocity. Previous experiments had found that continuous
turbulence destroys any salt fingers present because the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy
occurs at scales that are generally smaller than salt fingers widths. However, when turbulence
is present only intermittently, the salt fingers may have time to grow between turbulent events
and so contribute to the vertical diffusivities of heat and salt. We conclude that the vertical
buoyancy flux of salt fingers is strongly dependent upon the intermittency of the turbulence,
and equilibrium fluxes are only achieved if the time between turbulent events is much greater
than the e-folding time of the salt fingers. When these results are applied to an oceanographic
setting, the effect of intermittent turbulence, occurring more 5% of the time, is to reduce the
effective eddy diffusivity due to salt fingers below equilibrium salt finger values, so that at
R\rho &gt; &gt; 2 the eddy diffusivity is due only to turbulence. The time averaged salt fingers fluxes are
not significantly reduced by intermittent turbulence when R\rho &gt; 2 or if the intermittence occurs
less than 2% of the time, and so may contribute significant diapycnal fluxes in many parts of
the ocean.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saltfingers</field><field name="subject">salt fingers</field><field name="subject">double diffusion</field><field name="subject">convection</field><field name="subject">turbulence</field><field name="subject">gravity currents</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20011212.103012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Manufacture, Characterization and Aging of Novel High Temperature Carbon Fibre Composites.</field><field name="creator">Fox, Bronwyn Louise</field><field name="description">High temperature composite materials used in aerospace applications are exposed to extremely harsh conditions and must be able to withstand moisture and extremes of temperature.  For example, the surface of an aircraft flying at Mach 2.4 has been estimated to reach around 177&#176;C as a result of aerodynamic heating.  This thesis has examined the effect of isothermal aging on two high temperature composite materials, a novel CSIRO composite and a commercial composite, both based on bismaleimides.  Changes in mechanical properties and resin chemistry at two different temperatures were measured in order to assess the validity of accelerated aging tests.
&#182;
Delamination is a major cause of failure in materials, therefore, the Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness (GIC) of both materials was measured using the double cantilever beam (DCB) test.  After aging at 250&#176;C, the CSIRO CBR 320/328 composites exhibited better retention of GIC than the CIBA GEIGY Matrimid&#174; 5292 composites.  After 6 weeks of aging at this temperature, the CBR 320/328 material retained 100% of its initial interlaminar fracture toughness, however the Matrimid&#174; 5292 material retained only 64% of its initial GIC.  This trend was reversed at the lower aging temperature, when after 30 weeks of aging at 204&#176;C, GIC was measured at 13% of its original value for the CSIRO composites, whereas it was measured at 64% in the case of the Matrimid&#174; composites.  When the fracture surfaces of these specimens were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the commercial material was observed to show an increasing degree of porosity with aging at 204&#176;C.  It was concluded that the good property retention at the temperature, despite this observed porosity, was a result of the excellent fibre/matrix adhesion exhibited by this material.
&#182;
Chemical degradation of the matrix of the composites was monitored by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Raman Spectroscopy.  Chemical changes at the core of both of these materials were found to occur concurrently with the observed changes in interlaminar fracture toughness.  FTIR analysis of both matrix materials revealed the predominant degradation mechanism to be oxidation, specifically the oxidation of the methylene group bridging two aromatic rings common to the structure of both resins, was substantiated by the ingrowth of a broad peak centred at 1600cm-1.  In addition to this, the pyromellitic anhydride unit present only in the CBR 320/328 composites was found to be highly resistant to the effects of aging, whereas the saturated imide, common to the cured structures of both materials, was observed to degrade.
&#182;
Raman spectroscopy showed an increase in the intensity of a peak at 1646 cm-1 in the Matrimid&#174; 5292 composites aged at 250&#176;C towards the centre of the sample as a result of increased reaction of the allylic carbon-carbon double bond.  At 204&#176;C, the degree of reaction increased towards the surface of the material, possibly as a result of a reverse Diels-Alder reaction.  The glass transition temperatures of both materials were found to decrease with aging, with the exception of the CSR 320/328 composites aged at 204&#176;C, which initially increased due to continued crosslinking of the resin.
&#182;
It is concluded that the degradation mechanisms at the two aging temperatures are very different.  The reliability of results from accelerated (elevated temperature) aging tests has been drawn into doubt.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">composite</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">polyimide</field><field name="subject">FTIR</field><field name="subject">Raman</field><field name="subject">delamination</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20011207.114246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recombination and Trapping in Multicrystalline Silicon Solar Cells</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Daniel Harold</field><field name="description">In broad terms, this thesis is concerned with the measurement and interpretation of carrier lifetimes in multicrystalline silicon. An understanding of these lifetimes in turn leads to a clearer picture of the limiting mechanisms in solar cells made with this promising material, and points to possible paths for improvement. The work falls into three broad categories: gettering, trapping and recombination. A further section discusses a powerful new technique for characterising impurities in semiconductors in general, and provides an example of its application.
	Gettering of recombination centres in multicrystalline silicon wafers improves the bulk lifetime, often considerably. Although not employed deliberately in most commercial cell processes, gettering nevertheless occurs to some extent during emitter formation, and so may have an important impact on cell performance. However, the response of different wafers to gettering is quite variable, and in some cases is non-existent. Work in this thesis shows that the response to gettering is best when the dislocation density is low and the density of mobile impurities is high. For Eurosolare material these conditions prevail at the bottom and to a lesser extent in the middle of an ingot. However, these conclusions can not always be applied to multicrystalline silicon produced by other manufacturers. Low resistivity multicrystalline silicon suffers from a concurrent thermally induced degradation of the lifetime. This had previously been attributed to the dissolution of precipitated metals, although we note that the crystallographic quality also appears to deteriorate. The thermal degradation effect results in an optimum gettering time for low resistivity material. Edge-defined Film-fed Growth (EFG) ribbon silicon was also found to respond to gettering, and even more so to bulk hydrogenation. Evidence for Cu contamination in the as-grown EFG wafers is presented.
	Multicrystalline silicon is often plagued by trapping effects, which can make lifetime measurement in the injection-level range of interest very difficult, and sometimes impossible. An old model based on centres that trap and release minority carriers, but do not interact with majority carriers, was found to provide a good explanation for these effects. These trapping states were linked with the presence of dislocations and also with boron-impurity complexes. Their annealing behaviour and lack of impact on device parameters can be explained in terms of the models developed. The trapping model allowed a recently proposed method for correcting trap-affected data to be tested using typical values of the trapping parameters. The correction method was found to extend the range of useable data to approximately an order of magnitude lower in terms of carrier density than would be available otherwise, an improvement that could prove useful in many practical cases.
	High efficiency PERL and PERC cells made on gettered multicrystalline silicon resulted in devices with open circuit voltages in the 640mV range that were almost entirely limited by bulk recombination. Furthermore, the injection-level dependence of the bulk lifetime resulted in decreased fill factors. Modelling showed that these effects are even more pronounced for cells dominated by interstitial iron recombination centres. Analysis of a commercial multicrystalline cell fabrication process revealed that recombination in the emitter created the most stringent limit on the open circuit voltage, followed by the bulk and the rear surface. The fill factors of these commercial cells were mostly affected by series resistance, although some reduction due to injection-level dependent lifetimes seems likely also. Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy on gettered layers of multicrystalline silicon revealed the presence of Cr and Fe in considerable quantities. Further evidence strongly implied that they resided almost exclusively as precipitates.
	More generally, injection-level dependent lifetime measurements offer the prospect of powerful contamination-monitoring tools, provided that the impurities are well characterised in terms of their energy levels and capture cross-sections. Conversely, lifetime measurements can assist with this process of characterising impurities, since they are extremely sensitive to their presence. This possibility is explored in this thesis, and a new technique, dubbed Injection-level Dependent Lifetime Spectroscopy (IDLS) is developed. To test its potential, the method was applied to the well-known case of FeB pairs in boron-doped silicon. The results indicate that the technique can offer much greater accuracy than more conventional DLTS methods, and may find applications in microelectronics as well as photovoltaics.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multicrystalline</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">trapping</field><field name="subject">recombination lifetime</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20011218.134830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Quite Revolution:
An analysis of the change toward below-replacement-level fertility in Addis Ababa</field><field name="creator">Kinfu Ashagrea, Yohannes</field><field name="description">Rural-urban differentials in fertility behaviour are neither new nor surprising, but
a difference of over four children per woman as observed between rural Ethiopia
and the country's national capital, Addis Ababa, in 1990 is rare, possibly unique.
Reported fertility in Addis Ababa in 1990 was about 2.6 children per woman. By
the mid-1990s, it declined further to 1.8 children per woman. This study
investigates the dimensions, components and causes of this remarkable
reproductive change.
&#182;
The study specifically asks and seeks to answer the following questions. Is the
decline real, or is it merely an illusion created by faulty reporting? If it is real, how
has it come about? Did it result from a change in the onset of reproduction or a
decline in the proportion of women reaching high parities or both? And in what
context has such a fundamental, even revolutionary, change taken place in a
country and a continent that are mostly yet to join the global transition to a small
family-size norm.
&#182;
Data for the study were drawn from two national population censuses,
undertaken in 1984 and 1994, two fertility surveys, conducted in 1990 and 1995,
and a number of supplementary sources, including a qualitative study conducted
by the investigator. Results from the study confirm that the trend of declining
fertility and the recent fall to below-replacement-level are indeed real. As the
analysis shows the decline was largely driven by changes in the marriage pattern,
and supplemented by the increased propensity of fertility control observed across
all birth orders and age groups. All socio-economic groups in the city have had a
decline in cohort fertility and this was brought about both by shifts in population
composition (a composition effect) and increased intensity of fertility control
within each group (a rate effect). The institutional and cultural factors that are
believed to have prompted these changes are discussed in the thesis in some
detail.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fertility</field><field name="subject">Below-replacement fertility</field><field name="subject">Reproductive Revolution</field><field name="subject">Africa</field><field name="subject">Ethiopia</field><field name="subject">Addis Ababa</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20011218.163822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Problem of Nature in Contemporary Social Theory</field><field name="creator">Rutherford, Paul</field><field name="description">This work examines the ways in which the relationship between society and nature is problematic for social theory.

Michel Foucault&#146;s work on biopolitics and governmentality is examined against the background of his philosophical debate with Habermas on power and rationality. The growth of scientific ecology is shown to have both problematised the social relation to nature and provided the political technology for new forms of regulatory intervention in the management of the population and resources. These new forms of intervention constitute a form of ecological governmentality along the lines discussed by Foucault and others in relation to the human sciences. 
&#182;
However, Foucault&#146;s work is not sufficiently critical of the relationship between the natural sciences and power. Extending Foucault&#146;s biopolitics to environmental discourse is consistent with his general approach to power, but his incomplete critique of political sovereignty meant that for him agency remained tied to an idealised notion of the autonomy of the human subject. He therefore made too strong a distinction between the human and natural sciences and between power and the capacities of non-human entities, and continued to view the natural sciences as separating themselves from power in a way that was not possible in the human sciences. 
&#182;
A more general critique of epistemic sovereignty reveals that the natural sciences (including ecology) are subject to disciplinary and normalising practices similar to those of the human sciences. Foucault&#146;s key inadequacy is that he linked agency to human autonomy and sovereignty. The work of Bruno Latour and other actor network theorists show that an unambiguous ontological distinction between nature, material technologies and active human subjects is highly problematic. In the place of a separate &#145;society&#146; and &#145;nature&#146;, this thesis argues that it is preferable to see these as a single socio-nature populated by the hybrid products of translation networks. 
&#182;
By drawing together the insights of recent governmentality studies and the approach of actor network theory to agency and translation, Foucault&#146;s concept of biopolitics can be adapted to provide a theoretical framework for understanding the ecological programs of government that have emerged around the problem of nature in second half of the twentieth century.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social theory</field><field name="subject">sociology</field><field name="subject">political philosophy</field><field name="subject">science and technology studies</field><field name="subject">environmental regulation</field><field name="subject">environmental policy</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20011217.114840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problems and Prospects in Cross-Cultural Interactions in Japanese Multinational Corporations in Australia</field><field name="creator">Sakurai, Yuka</field><field name="description">As multinational corporations (MNCs) are extending their international operations they need to examine issues such as the localisation of human resource policies and management, and the effective use of local and expatriate managers. Examination of expatriate studies indicates a lack of attention given to the relationships between expatriate managers and local managers or the perspectives of local managers working in MNCs. This thesis attempts to fill these gaps by focusing on the cross-cultural interactions between expatriate and local managers. This thesis addresses the importance of positive cross-cultural understanding between Japanese expatriate managers and local managers in Japanese subsidiaries in Australia, and its effect on work-related outcomes such as job satisfaction and commitment to the organisation. It identifies macro and micro factors which are associated with levels of job satisfaction and commitment of Japanese expatriate managers and Australian managers with special focus on economic functions of industry, communication, and mutual perceptions. Conceptual models for predicting organisational commitment for Japanese expatriate and Australian managers are developed, and the validity of the models is empirically tested.
&#182;
Australian managers and Japanese expatriate managers working for Australian subsidiaries of twelve Japanese-owned firms completed self-report questionnaires anonymously. A unique paired data set is used for particular analyses such as measuring communication and perceptions of each other. This thesis examines differences in work values and beliefs between Japanese expatriates and Australian managers on issues derived from structural and cultural features of Japanese MNCs; for example, the type of subsidiary-head office management (eg. strategic planning), integration of local managers, group-oriented decision making, and work ethic. It is found that there is a significant gap in perceptions between Japanese and Australian managers with regard to corporate membership, but no significant differences are found in their opinions towards the strategic planning style of management. Contrary to our expectations, Australian managers are found to be more group-oriented than Japanese managers.
&#182;
The characteristics of two industries, general trading firms (the sogo shosha) and manufacturing firms, are discussed and their impacts upon cross-cultural relationships and work attitudes of managers are examined. Findings indicate that Australian managers in manufacturing firms have more positive perceptions of work relations with Japanese managers and positive work attitudes than Australian managers in the sogo shosha. This suggests that manufacturing firms provide a more positive work environment to Australian managers than the sogo shosha, whereas cross-cultural interactions in the sogo shosha are not very effective, which may cause misunderstanding and mistrust between managers, and lower levels of job satisfaction and organisational commitment of local managers. The type of industry does not affect the work attitudes of Japanese managers or their perceptions of Australian counterparts. 
&#182;
A conceptual model for predicting the organisational commitment of Japanese and Australian managers are developed and tested empirically. Independent variables included in the model are: individual characteristics, type of industry, psychological integration of local managers into the Japanese organisation, work relations between Japanese and local managers and job satisfaction. Results indicate that job satisfaction, work relations and tenure have significant impacts upon organisational commitment of Australian managers. As for the Japanese managers, job satisfaction and tenure have significant impacts upon organisational commitment, but no association between work relations and organisational commitment is found. In addition, the relationship between work relations and organisational commitment for the Australian managers is partially mediated by job satisfaction, however, this is not the case with the Japanese managers.  
&#182;
The findings of this thesis will improve our understanding of cross-cultural interactions between expatriates and local managers, increasing overall firm performance and improving the quality of cross-cultural relationships within contemporary society. Moreover, these findings will provide a wider perspective on understanding how organisations can implement localisation of management and integrate local managers into the organisation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multinational organisation</field><field name="subject">Japanese management</field><field name="subject">international human resource management</field><field name="subject">organisational commitment</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural communication</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020122.092141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Client perceptions : a useful measure of coordination of health care</field><field name="creator">McGuiness, Clare Frances</field><field name="description">Despite the many interventions and trials aimed at improving coordination of health care, there is currently no accepted measurement of coordination.  My professional interests and an opportunity provided by the Care Plus (Coordinated Care) Trial in the ACT led me to consider client perceptions as a potentially appropriate measure.  My research question is &#147;can coordination of health care be usefully measured through client perceptions?&#148;  
&#182;
I addressed this question by developing and testing an instrument to measure perceptions of coordination called the Client Perceptions of Coordination Questionnaire (CPCQ).  In the thesis I describe the processes of developing the instrument, testing it through use in several studies and considering how useful such an instrument may be for health services research.  In addition to the Coordinated Care Trial, I conducted two validation studies - in a chronic pain population and a general practice sample.
&#182;
In Part 1 of the results I demonstrate good face, content and discriminant validity, and reliability of the instrument.  Psychometric analysis of the CPCQ did not support scaling, and identified areas were the instrument could be improved.  Nevertheless the underlying construct of client perception of coordination as a measure is entirely new, and it is therefore worthwhile to explore its associations with other health outcome data.  In Part 2 I use a single item from the CPCQ, &#147;how often did you feel the care you received was well-coordinated?&#148; to explore this construct.  I explore the influences upon on client perceptions of coordination, and examine its associations with service utilisation and health outcome data.
&#182;
The construct of &#145;perceived coordination&#146;, and the capacity of the CPCQ to measure it accurately show considerable promise as measures of health care.  Consistent trends were found that suggested coordination was a complex construct, and that a stronger theoretical base was needed to interpret this complexity.  Theory is the first of the &#145;phases&#146; of instrument development, and so I revisit these in order to summarise the strengths and weaknesses of the current CPCQ.  Overall, the perceptions of coordination have surprisingly plausible associations with other health data, the effort to improve the instrument should be worthwhile for a wide range of health service evaluation and research.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Patient satisfaction; instrument design; coordination of health care</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020124.141250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced Interferometry for Gravitational Wave Detection</field><field name="creator">Shaddock, Daniel Anthony</field><field name="description">In this thesis we investigate advanced techniques for the readout and control of various interferometers. In particular, we present experimental investigations of interferometer configurations and control techniques to be used in second generation interferometric gravitational wave detectors. We also present a new technique, tilt locking, for the readout and control of optical interferometers.
&#182;
We report the first experimental demonstration of a Sagnac interferometer with resonant sideband extraction (RSE). We measure the frequency response to modulation of the length of the arms and demonstrate an increase in signal bandwidth of by a factor of 6.5 compared to the Sagnac with arm cavities only. We compare Sagnac interferometers based on optical cavities with cavity-based Michelson interferometers and find that the Sagnac configuration has little overall advantage in a cavity-based system.
&#182;
A system for the control and signal extraction of a power recycled Michelson interferometer with RSE is presented. This control system employs a frontal modulation scheme requiring a phase modulated carrier field and a phase modulated subcarrier field. The system is capable of locking all 5 length degrees of freedom and allows the signal cavity to be detuned over the entire range of possibilities, in principle, whilst maintaining lock. We analytically investigate the modulation/demodulation techniques used to obtain these error signals, presenting an introductory explanation of single sideband modulation/demodulation and double demodulation.
&#182;
This control system is implemented on a benchtop prototype interferometer. We discuss technical problems associated with production of the input beam modulation components and present several solutions. Operation of the interferometer is demonstrated for a wide range of detunings. The frequency response of the interferometer is measured for various detuned points and we observe good agreement with theoretical predictions. The ability of the control system to maintain lock as the interferometer is detuned is experimentally demonstrated.
&#182;
Tilt locking, a new technique to obtain an error signal to lock a laser to an optical cavity, is presented. This technique produces an error signal by efficient measurement of the interference between the TEM00 and TEM10 modes. We perform experimental and theoretical comparisons with the widely used Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique. We derive the quantum noise limit to the sensitivity of a measurement of the beam position, and using this result calculate the shot noise limited sensitivity of tilt locking. We show that tilt locking has a quantum efficiency of 80%, compared to 82% for the PDH technique.
We present experimental demonstrations of tilt locking in several applications including frequency stabilisation, continuous-wave second harmonic generation, and injection locking of a Nd:YAG slab laser. In each of these cases, we demonstrate that the performance of tilt locking is not the limiting factor of the lock stability, and show that it achieves similar performance to the PDH based system. 
&#182;
Finally, we discuss how tilt locking can be effectively applied to two beam interferometers. We show experimentally how a two beam interferometer typically gives excellent isolation against errors arising from changes in the photodetector position, and experimentally demonstrate the use of tilt locking as a signal readout system for a Sagnac interferometer.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interferometry</field><field name="subject">gravitational waves</field><field name="subject">tilt locking</field><field name="subject">injection locking</field><field name="subject">optical cavity</field><field name="subject">resonanant sideband extraction</field><field name="subject">Sagnac interferometer</field><field name="subject">Michelson interferometer</field><field name="subject">power recycling</field><field name="subject">signal recycling</field><field name="subject">spatial mode interference</field><field name="subject">modulation</field><field name="subject">demodulation</field><field name="subject">frequency stabilisation</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020227.171850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Climate - Surface Hydrology Interactions in Data Sparse Areas</field><field name="creator">Evans, Jason Peter</field><field name="description">The interaction between climate and land-surface hydrology is extremely important in relation to long term water 

resource planning. This is especially so in the presence of global warming and massive land use change, issues which 

seem likely to have a disproportionate impact on developing countries. This thesis develops tools aimed at the study 

and prediction of climate effects on land-surface hydrology (in particular streamflow), which require a minimum 

amount of site specific data. This minimum data requirement allows studies to be performed in areas that are data 

sparse, such as the developing world.

&#182;
A simple lumped dynamics-encapsulating conceptual rainfall-runoff model, which explicitly calculates the evaporative 

feedback to the atmosphere, was developed. It uses the linear streamflow routing module of the rainfall-runoff model 

IHACRES, with a new non-linear loss module based on the Catchment Moisture Deficit accounting scheme, and is referred 

to as CMD-IHACRES. In this model, evaporation can be calculated using a number of techniques depending on the data 

available, as a minimum, one to two years of precipitation, temperature and streamflow data are required. The model 

was tested on catchments covering a large range of hydroclimatologies and shown to estimate streamflow well. When 

tested against evaporation data the simplest technique was found to capture the medium to long term average well but 

had difficulty reproducing the short-term variations.

&#182;
A comparison of the performance of three limited area climate models (MM5/BATS, MM5/SHEELS and RegCM2) was conducted 

in order to quantify their ability to reproduce near surface variables. Components of the energy and water balance 

over the land surface display considerable variation among the models, with no model performing consistently better 

than the other two. However, several conclusions can be made. The MM5 longwave radiation scheme performed worse than 

the scheme implemented in RegCM2. Estimates of runoff displayed the largest variations and differed from observations 

by as much as 100%. The climate models exhibited greater variance than the observations for almost all the energy and 

water related fluxes investigated. 

&#182;
An investigation into improving these streamflow predictions by utilizing CMD-IHACRES was conducted. Using 

CMD-IHACRES in an 'offline' mode greatly improved the streamflow estimates while the simplest evaporation technique 

reproduced the evaporative time series to an accuracy comparable to that obtained from the limited area models alone. 

The ability to conduct a climate change impact study using CMD-IHACRES and a stochastic weather generator is also 

demonstrated. These results warrant further investigation into incorporating the rainfall-runoff model CMD-IHACRES 

in a fully coupled 'online' approach.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrology</field><field name="subject">hydrological modelling</field><field name="subject">climate modelling</field><field name="subject">regional climate</field><field name="subject">land surface - atmosphere interactions</field><field name="subject">evapotranspiration</field><field name="subject">water resources</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020313.032142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods for Distributed Information Retrieval</field><field name="creator">Craswell, Nicholas Eric</field><field name="description">Published methods for distributed information retrieval generally rely on cooperation from search servers. But most real servers, particularly the tens of thousands available on the Web, are not engineered for such cooperation. This means that the majority of methods proposed, and evaluated in simulated environments of homogeneous cooperating servers, are never applied in practice. 
&#182;
This thesis introduces new methods for server selection and results merging. The methods do not require search servers to cooperate, yet are as effective as the best methods which do. Two large experiments evaluate the new methods against many previously published methods. In contrast to previous experiments they simulate a Web-like environment, where servers employ varied retrieval algorithms and tend not to sub-partition documents from a single source. 
&#182;
The server selection experiment uses pages from 956 real Web servers, three different retrieval systems and TREC ad hoc topics. Results show that a broker using queries to sample servers&#146; documents can perform selection over non-cooperating servers without loss of effectiveness. However, using the same queries to estimate the effectiveness of servers, in order to favour servers with high quality retrieval systems, did not consistently improve selection effectiveness. 
&#182;
The results merging experiment uses documents from five TREC sub-collections, five different retrieval systems and TREC ad hoc topics. Results show that a broker using a reference set of collection statistics, rather than relying on cooperation to collate true statistics, can perform merging without loss of effectiveness. Since application of the reference statistics method requires that the broker download the documents to be merged, experiments were also conducted on effective merging based on partial documents. The new ranking method developed was not highly effective on partial documents, but showed some promise on fully downloaded documents. 
&#182;
Using the new methods, an effective search broker can be built, capable of addressing any given set of available search servers, without their cooperation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">web search</field><field name="subject">distributed information retrieval</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020315.142540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expressions of Inner Freedom</field><field name="creator">Timmers, Heiko</field><field name="description">This study investigates the fusion and scattering of nuclei at energies spanning the Coulomb barrier. The coupling of the relative motion of the nuclei to internal degrees of freedom can be thought to give rise to a distribution of potential barriers.
&#182;
Two new methods to extract representations of these potential barrier distributions are suggested using the eigen-channel model. The new techniques are based on measurements of quasi-elastic and elastic backscattering excitation functions, from which the representations are extracted by differentiation. A third method utilizing transfer excitation functions is introduced using qualitative arguments. The techniques are investigated experimentally for the reactions 16O + 92Zr, 144,154Sm, 186W and 208Pb. The results are compared with barrier distribution representations obtained from fusion data. The methods are further explored using the systems 40Ca + 90,96Zr and 32S + 208Pb, for which scattering and fusion excitation functions have been measured. The new barrier distribution representations are consistent with the one from fusion. They are direct evidence of the effects of the internal degrees of freedom on channels other than the fusion channel. 
&#182;
The new representations are, however, less sensitive to the barrier distribution compared to their fusion counterpart. This observation is investigated using coupled-channels calculations. They suggest that residual weak reaction channels, which are not included in the coupling matrix, are responsible for the reduction in sensitivity. In the case of quasi-elastic scattering a distortion of the barrier structure above the average barrier is observed. This effect appears to be due to the de-phasing of the scattering amplitudes contributing to each eigen-channel. Using the heaviest system, 32S + 208Pb, it is demonstrated that there is no improvement in sensitivity to the barrier distribution for systems with large Sommerfeld parameters. This suggests that diffraction effects are not likely to be the cause of the sensitivity reduction.
&#182;
The new techniques may be employed successfully in systems with pronounced barrier structure below the average barrier. This is the case for the reactions 40Ca + 90,96Zr. It is shown that for these systems the quasi-elastic scattering and the fusion representations of the barrier distribution contain the same information. The extracted barrier distributions for the two reactions are distinctively different. They are compared to assess the relative importance of collective excitations and neutron transfer in fusion. Exact coupled-channels calculations show that the distribution for 40Ca + 90Zr arises from coupling of the relative motion to double phonon excitations of 90Zr. Further calculations suggest that the reaction 40Ca + 96Zr involves additional coupling to sequential neutron transfer, which is proposed to be a precursor of neutron-neck formation.
&#182;
Double phonon excitations are also seen to be important in the system 32S + 208Pb, for which the barrier distribution representations show in addition signatures of one and two neutron transfer.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Physics</field><field name="subject">Nuclear Reactions</field><field name="subject">Fusion</field><field name="subject">Heavy Ions</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020328.152158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bernard of Morlaix : the Literature of complaint, the Latin tradition and the Twelfth-century &#147;Renaissance&#148;</field><field name="creator">Balnaves, John</field><field name="description">Bernard of Morlaix was a Cluniac monk who flourished around 1140.  What little is known about him, including his visit to Rome, is examined in relation to the affairs of the Cluniac family in his day.  A new conjecture is advanced that he was prior of Saint-Denis de Nogent-le-Rotrou.  His poems are discussed as examples of the genre of complaint literature.  His treatment of the end of the world, and of death, judgement, heaven and hell, is discussed in relation to twelfth-century monasticism.  His castigation of the sins of his time includes some of the earliest estates satire.  His anticlericalism and his misogyny are compared with those of his contemporaries, and discussed in the context of twelfth-century monastic culture.  Bernard&#146;s classical learning is analysed and compared with that of his contemporaries, especially John of Salisbury and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux.  His use of metre and rhyme is examined in the context of the development of metre based on stress rather than quantity and of systematic and sustained rhyme in the Latin verse of the twelfth century.  Bernard&#146;s use of interpretive and compositional allegory is explored.  Bernard is seen as a man of his time, exemplifying a number of twelfth-century characteristics, religious, educational and cultural.  Special attention is paid to the Latin literary tradition, and it is suggested that the culture of the twelfth-century was in many respects a culmination rather than a renaissance.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bernard of Morlaix</field><field name="subject">Bernard of Cluny</field><field name="subject">complaint literature</field><field name="subject">12th century</field><field name="subject">twelfth-century monasticism</field><field name="subject">Latin literary tradition</field><field name="subject">classical learning</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020515.114244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualisation, navigation and mathematical perception: a visual notation for rational numbers mod1</field><field name="creator">Tolmie, Julie</field><field name="description">There are three main results in this dissertation.
The first result is the construction of an abstract visual space for rational
numbers mod1, based on the visual primitives, colour, and rational radial
direction. Mathematics is performed in this visual notation by defining
increasingly refined visual objects from these primitives. In particular,
the existence of the Farey tree enumeration of rational numbers mod1
is identified in the texture of a two-dimensional animation.
&#182;
The second result is a new enumeration of the rational numbers mod1,
obtained, and expressed, in abstract visual space, as the visual object
coset waves of coset fans on the torus. Its geometry is shown to encode
a countably infinite tree structure, whose branches are cosets, nZ+m,
where n, m (and k) are integers. These cosets are in geometrical 1-1
correspondence with sequences kn+m, (of denominators) of rational
numbers, and with visual subobjects of the torus called coset fans.
&#182;
The third result is an enumeration in time of the visual hierarchy of the
discrete buds of the Mandelbrot boundary by coset waves of coset fans.
It is constructed by embedding the circular Farey tree geometrically into
the empty internal region of the Mandelbrot set. In particular, coset fans
attached to points of the (internal) binary tree index countably infinite

It is clear that the contemporary manifestations of regionalism (the completion of the internal market of the European Communities in 1992, Asia Pacific developments, and US-centred Western hemisphere moves) constitute a new and qualitatively different factor in both interstate relations and the international political economy. The growth in the development of regions in the 1980s also represents a new level of interstate collaboration in the international system. The question arises as to the causes of this 'new regionalism' of the 1980s, and the implications of these developments for international relations practice and theory. Investigating these issues is the main task of this thesis.
&#182;
This thesis involves three elements: a central contemporary element examining the re-emergence of regions in the 1980s; a second comparative element comparing the causal factors operating in three different regions; and lastly, a theoretical element examining the usefulness of current theory to the phenomenon of regionalism in the 1980s and 1990s.
Chapters Two and Three discuss the relevant theoretical literature with a view to developing the propositions to be examined in the case studies. They examine three of the major streams of international relations theory - realism, liberal economics, and institutionalism - with a focus on what these contending theories have had to say about how regional groupings arise. Chapter Two looks at the relevant theoretical literature in the 1950s and 1960s while Chapter Three explores the more recent theoretical literature of the 1970s and 1980s. 
&#182;
The rest of the body of the thesis tests propositions set out at the end of Chapter Three on the causes of the regionalist revival in the 1980s by way of three case studies, each one concerned with the actual development of regionalism in three different parts of the globe: Western Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific. 
&#182;
In all three regions the move towards regionalism was clearly a reaction to negative developments in the international economic and political systems. It was in part a specific response to the undermining of the liberal international trading regime and the associated rise in protectionism, particularly in the US. It was also partly the result of an ideational shift in terms of economic doctrine away from keynesianism and import substitution industrialisation to economic liberalism and export-oriented economic growth. Yet it is also apparent from the case studies that the new regionalism was also to some extent the result of a kind of interactive chain reaction, a spiral of mutual anxiety, with regionalism in one area provoking an extension of regionalism in another. It is indeed difficult to establish which of these causal explanations is the principal one as it is clear from the case studies that they are in fact mutually reinforcing. 
&#182;
The thesis concludes with an analysis of the insights provided by the case studies into the theoretical debates examined in Chapters Two and Three. Finally, there is an attempt to use these insights to construct a theory accounting for the rise of the new regionalism.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">economic regionalism</field><field name="subject">trade blocs</field><field name="subject">free trade areas</field><field name="subject">Asia PacificEconomic Cooperation</field><field name="subject">North American Free Trade Area</field><field name="subject">EuropeanSingle Integrated Market</field><field name="subject">European Community</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20011210.141305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring Health Care Using National Administrative Data Collections</field><field name="creator">Kelman, Christopher William</field><field name="description">With the inevitable adoption of information technology into all areas of human pursuit, the potential benefits for health care should not be overlooked.  In Australia, details of most health care encounters are currently recorded for administrative purposes.  This results in an impressive electronic data-bank that could provide a national resource for health service evaluation.
&#182;
Evaluation of health services has become increasingly important to provide indicators of the benefits, risks and cost-effectiveness of treatments.  However, if administrative data are to be used for this purpose, several questions must first be addressed:  Are the current data collections accessible?  What outcome measures can be derived from these data?  Can privacy issues be managed?  Could the quality of the data be improved?  Is the existing infrastructure adequate to supply data for evaluation purposes?  Could the existing system provide a basis for the development of an integrated health information system?
&#182;
The aims of the project were:
&#183;	To examine the potential for using administrative data to generate outcome measures and surveillance indicators.
&#183;	To investigate the logistics of gaining access to these data for the purpose of research.  This to be achieved within the current ethical, political and financial framework.
&#183;	To compare the Australian health-service data system with the current international state-of-the-art.
&#183;	To develop suggestions for expansion of the present system as part of an integrated health record and information system.  This system to manage patient records and provide data for quality management, treatment surveillance and cost-effectiveness evaluation as a routine activity.
&#182;
The thesis is presented in two parts.  In the first part, a historical cohort study is described that involved patients with implantable medical devices. The potential to evaluate outcomes was investigated using all national health-service information currently available in electronic form.  Record linkage techniques were used to combine and augment the existing data collections.  Australia&#146;s national health databases are to varying degrees, amenable to such linkage and cover doctor visits, pharmaceuticals, hospital admissions and deaths.  The study focused on medical devices as an illustrative case but the results are applicable to the routine assessment of all medical and surgical interventions.
&#182;
For the Australian &#145;Medical Devices study&#146;, the records of 5,316 patients who had medical device implants in 1993-94 were selected from the archives of a major private health insurer.  Five groups of medical implants were studied: heart valves, pacemakers, hips, vascular grafts and intra-optic lenses. Outcomes for these patients, including death, re-operation and health service utilisation, were compared and analysed. 
&#182;
A comparison study was performed using data from the Manitoba Health database in Winnipeg, Canada. Manitoba provides a very similar demographic group to that found in Australia and is an example of a prototype integrated-health-information system.  One of the principal advantages for research is that personally identified data about medical and hospital services are collected for all patients.  Selection bias is eliminated because individual consent is not required for this type of research and all selected patients could be included in the study. 
&#182;
The two studies revealed many barriers to the use of administrative data for health outcomes research.  Service event data for the Australian cohort could be collected but only after long delays and hospital morbidity data were not available for the entire cohort.  In contrast to the situation in Australia, the Manitoba data were both accessible and complete, but were lacking in detail in some areas.
&#182;
Analysis of the collected data demonstrated that without the addition of clinical data only general indications of trends could be deduced.  However, with minimal supplementary clinical data, it was possible to examine differences in performance between brands of medical devices thus indicating one of the uses for this type of data collection.
&#182;
In the second part of the thesis, conclusions are presented about the potential uses and limitations of the existing system and its use as a basis for the development of a national Integrated Health Record and Information System (IHRIS).  The need for the establishment of a systemic quality management system for health care is discussed.
&#182;
The study shows that linked administrative data can provide information about health outcomes which is not readily available from other sources.  If expanded and integrated, the system that is currently used to collect and manage administrative data, could provide the basis for a national health information system.  This system would provide many benefits for health care.  Benefits would include the monitoring, surveillance and cost-effectiveness analysis of new and existing treatments involving medical devices, drugs and surgical procedures.  An integrated health information system could thus provide for both clinical and administrative needs, while in addition providing data for research.
&#182;
Unfortunately,  in Australia, the use of administrative data for this purpose is not currently feasible.  The principal barrier is the existence of a culture within the Australian health care system which is not supportive of research and is deficient in quality and safety measures. 
&#182;
Recent initiatives by both the Commonwealth and state governments have supported the introduction of measures to improve quality and safety in health care.  It is argued here that an Integrated Health Record and Information System (IHRIS) would provide an essential component of any such scheme.  The results of this study have important policy implications for health care management in both the administrative and clinical domains.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">health care</field><field name="subject">national administrative data collections</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">health services</field><field name="subject">patient records</field><field name="subject">cohort study</field><field name="subject">implantable medical devices</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Manitoba</field><field name="subject">record linkage</field><field name="subject">cost-effectiveness</field><field name="subject">surveillance</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020620.151547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Problem Model for Decision Support Systems</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Mark A</field><field name="description">This body of research focuses on supporting problem-stakeholders, decision-makers and
problem-solvers faced with an ill-defined and complex real world problem. An ill-defined
problem has a characteristic trait of continual refinement. That is, the definition
of the problem changes throughout the problem investigation and resolution process.
The central theme of this research is that a support system should provide problem
stakeholders with a problem definition model for constructing and manipulating a
representation of the definition of the problem as they understand it. The approach
adopted herein is to first develop a problem definition model for ill-defined problems&#151;
the 6-Component problem definition model. With this model, it is then possible to move
on to identifying the types of changes or modifications to the problem definition that
problem stakeholders, decision makers and problem solvers may wish to explore.
Importantly, there must be a connection between the surface representation of the
problem and the underlying implementation of the support system. This research argues
that by focusing the support system around the problem definition, it is possible to
reduce the mismatch between the problem objectives and the representation of the
problem that the support system offers. This research uses the Unified Modelling
Language to record and explore the requirements that problem stakeholders, faced with
an evolving problem definition, place on a support system. The 6-Component problem
definition model is then embedded within a design for an evolutionary support system.
This embedding, supported by collaboration diagrams, shows how a system using the
6-Component problem definition model will support stakeholders in their exploration,
evaluation and resolution of an ill-defined and complex real-world problem. A case
study provides validation of the effectiveness of the 6-Component problem definition
model proposed and developed in this work. The case study uses the 6-Component
problem definition model as a basis for implementing the Integration Workbench, an
evolutionary support system for land-use planning. Stakeholders explore, communicate,
evaluate and resolve the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement problem with
assistance from the Integration Workbench.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">problem definition model</field><field name="subject">evolutionary problem support system</field><field name="subject">ill-defined</field><field name="subject">complex real-world problems</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020717.144031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electro-optic control of quantum measurements</field><field name="creator">Buchler, Benjamin Caird</field><field name="description">The performance of optical measurement systems is ultimately limited by the
quantum nature of light.  In this thesis, two techniques for circumventing the
standard quantum measurement limits are modelled and tested experimentally. 
These techniques are electro-optic control and the use of squeezed light.

An optical parametric amplifier is used to generate squeezing at
1064nm.  The parametric amplifier is pumped by the output of a second
harmonic generation cavity, which in turn is pumped by a Nd:YAG laser. 
By using various frequency locking techniques, the quadrature phase of
the squeezing is stabilised, therefore making our squeezed source
suitable for long term measurements.  The best recorded squeezing is
5.5dB (or 70\%) below the standard quantum limit.  The stability of
our experiment makes it possible to perform a time domain measurement
of photocurrent correlations due to squeezing.  This technique allows
direct visualisation of the quantum correlations caused by squeezed
light.

On the road to developing our squeezed source, methods of frequency
locking optical cavities are investigated.  In particular, the tilt
locking method is tested on the second harmonic generation cavity
used in the squeezing experiment.  The standard method for locking
this cavity involves the use of modulation sidebands, therefore leading to a
noisy second harmonic wave.  The modulation free tilt-locking method,
which is based on spatial mode interference, is shown to be a
reliable alternative.

In some cases, electro-optic control may be used to suppress quantum
measurement noise.  Electro-optic feedback is investigated as a method
for suppressing radiation pressure noise in an optical cavity. 
Modelling shows that the `squashed' light inside a feedback loop can
reduce radiation pressure noise by a factor of two below the standard
quantum limit.  This result in then applied to a thermal noise
detection system.  The reduction in radiation pressure noise is shown
to give improved thermal noise sensitivity, therefore proving that 
the modified noise properties of light inside a feedback loop can be 
used to reduce quantum measurement noise.

Another method of electro-optic control is electro-optic feedforward. 
This is also investigated as a technique for manipulating quantum
measurements.  It is used to achieve noiseless amplification of a
phase quadrature signal.  The results clearly show that a feedforward
loop is a phase sensitive amplifier that breaks the quantum limit for
phase insensitive amplification.  This experiment is the first
demonstration of noiseless phase quadrature amplification.

Finally, feedforward is explored as a tool for improving the
performance of quantum nondemolition measurements.  Modelling shows
that feedforward is an effective method of increasing signal transfer
efficiency.  Feedforward is also shown to work well in conjunction with
meter squeezing.  Together, meter squeezing and feedforward provide a
comprehensive quantum nondemolition enhancement package.  Using the
squeezed light from our optical parametric amplifier, an experimental
demonstration of the enhancement scheme is shown to achieve  record
signal transfer efficiency of $T_{s}+T_{m}=1.81$.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quantum noise</field><field name="subject">Radiation</field><field name="subject">pressure</field><field name="subject">Quantum nondemolition measurement</field><field name="subject">Squeezed light.</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020527.131758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhetorical  Structure
Analysis  of  the  Indonesian
Research  Articles</field><field name="creator">Safnil, --</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses rhetorical features of Indonesian research articles (RAs) in three disciplinary areas: Economics, Education and Psychology. These were written by Indonesian speakers and published mainly in university-based scientific journals. The main focus of this thesis is on the examination of the patterns of communicative purposes or &#145;Moves&#146; and their subsequent elements or &#145;Steps&#146; of the introduction sections of these articles. The analyses include the examination of communicative purposes and persuasive values of the texts, linguistic resources used to materialise the communicative purposes and persuasions, and the cultural factors (ie. norms, beliefs and values) and scientific practices and academic writing conventions underlying the specific rhetorical features. 
&#182;
This study found that the macro rhetorical structure of the Indonesian RAs (ie. the Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion or IMRD pattern) is relatively similar to that of the English RAs except that, unlike in English RAs, the conclusion and suggestion section in the Indonesian RAs have a separate section. However, the communicative purposes and persuasions in the introduction sections in the two groups of the RAs (English and Indonesian) are relatively different. Differences are also found in the way that rhetorical works use the linguistic resources to materialise the communicative purposes and persuasions in the introduction sections of the two groups of RAs. Some of the rhetorical differences are because of the differences in the research practices and scientific writing conventions in Indonesian and in English speaking countries, while others are because of cultural differences reflected in the two languages.
&#182;
The pedagogical implication of this study is that the Indonesian RA genre needs to be explicitly taught to Indonesian students, particularly university students in order to give them more access to the content of Indonesian research, and to develop skills needed by Indonesian researchers and research writers. For this purpose, an appropriate approach needs to be developed; that is to teach the generic features of Indonesian RAs such as those in social sciences written in Bahasa Indonesia or Indonesian.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rhetorical structure</field><field name="subject">research articles</field><field name="subject">genre analysis</field><field name="subject">introduction section</field><field name="subject">macro discourse analysis level</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020726.095142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real Time Characterisation of the 
Mobile Multipath Channel</field><field name="creator">Teal, Paul D</field><field name="description">In this thesis a new approach for characterisation of digital mobile radio channels is investigated.  The new approach is based on recognition of the fact that while the fading which is characteristic of the mobile radio channel is very rapid, the processes underlying this fading may vary much more slowly.  The comparative stability of these underlying processes has not been exploited in system designs to date.

Channel models are proposed which take account of the stability of the
channel.  Estimators for the parameters of the models are proposed, and their performance is analysed theoretically and by simulation and
measurement.

Bounds are derived for the extent to which the mobile channel can be
predicted, and the critical factors which define these bounds are
identified.

Two main applications arise for these channel models. The first is the
possibility of prediction of the overall system performance.  This may be used to avoid channel fading (for instance by change of frequency), or
compensate for it (by change of the signal rate or by power control).  The
second application is in channel equalisation.  An equaliser based on a
model which has parameters varying only very slowly can offer improved
performance especially in the case of channels which appear to be varying
so rapidly that the convergence rate of an equaliser based on the
conventional model is not adequate.

The first of these applications is explored, and a relationship is derived between the channel impulse response and the performance of a broadband system.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mobile communications</field><field name="subject">real time characterisation</field><field name="subject">channel prediction</field><field name="subject">real time prediction</field><field name="subject">multipath fading</field><field name="subject">channel model</field><field name="subject">mobile radio</field><field name="subject">multipath transmission</field><field name="subject">array processing</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="subject">scattering</field><field name="subject">correlation</field><field name="subject">maximum likelihood</field><field name="subject">MLSE</field><field name="subject">broadband</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020722.085502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phase formation and structural transformation of strontium ferrite SrFeOx</field><field name="creator">Schmidt, Marek, Wojciech</field><field name="description">Non-stoichiometric strontium iron oxide is described by an abbreviated formula SrFeOx (2.5 &#8804; x &#8804; 3.0) exhibits a variety of interesting physical and chemical properties over a broad range of temperatures and in different
gaseous environments. The oxide contains a mixture of iron in the trivalent and the rare tetravalent state. The material at elevated temperature is a mixed oxygen conductor and it, or its derivatives,can have practical
applications in oxygen conducting devices such as pressure driven oxygen
generators, partial oxidation reactors in electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells
(SOFC).
&#182;
This thesis examines the behaviour of the material at ambient and elevated temperatures using a broad spectrum of solid state experimental
techniques such as: x-ray and neutron powder diffraction,thermogravimetric and calorimetric methods,scanning electron microscopy and Mossbauer
spectroscopy. Changes in the oxide were induced using conventional thermal
treatment in various atmospheres as well as mechanical energy (ball milling).
The first experimental chapter examines the formation of the ferrite from
a mixture of reactants.It describes the chemical reactions and phase transitions that lead to the formation of the oxide. Ball milling of the reactants prior to annealing was found to eliminate transient phases from the reaction route and to increase the kinetics of 
the reaction at lower temperatures.
Examination of the thermodynamics of iron oxide (hematite) used for the
reactions led to a new route of synthesis of the ferrite frommagnetite and
strontium carbonate.This chapter also explores the possibility of synthesis
of the material at room temperature using ball milling.
&#182;
The ferrite strongly interacts with the gas phase so its behaviour was studied under different pressures of oxygen and in carbon dioxide.The changes in ferrite composition have an equilibrium character and depend on temperature and oxygen concentration in the 
atmosphere. Variations of the oxygen
content x were described as a function of temperature and oxygen partial
pressure, the results were used to plot an equilibrium composition diagram.
The heat of oxidation was also measured as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure.
&#182;
Interaction of the ferrite with carbon dioxide below a critical temperature
causes decomposition of the material to strontium carbonate and SrFe12O19 .
The critical temperature depends on the partial pressure of CO2 and above
the critical temperature the carbonate and SrFe12O19 are converted back into
the ferrite.The resulting SrFe12O19 is very resistant towards carbonation and
the thermal carbonation reaction does not lead to a complete decomposition
of SrFeOx to hematite and strontium carbonate.
&#182;
The thermally induced oxidation and carbonation reactions cease at room
temperature due to sluggish kinetics however,they can be carried out at ambient temperature using ball milling.The reaction routes for these processes are different from the thermal routes.The mechanical oxidation induces two
or more concurrent reactions which lead to samples containing two or more
phases. The mechanical carbonation on the other hand produces an unknown
metastable iron carbonate and leads a complete decomposition of the ferrite
to strontiumcarbonate and hematite.
&#182;
Thermally and mechanically oxidized samples were studied using Mossbauer 
spectroscopy. The author proposes a new interpretation of the Sr4Fe4O11
(x=2.75) and Sr8Fe8O23 (x=2.875)spectra.The interpretation is based
on the chemistry of the compounds and provides a simpler explanation of
the observed absorption lines.The Mossbauer results froma range of compositions 
revealed the roomtemperature phase behaviour of the ferrite also
examined using x-ray diffraction.
&#182;
The high-temperature crystal structure of the ferrite was examined using
neutron powder diffraction.The measurements were done at temperatures
up to 1273K in argon and air atmospheres.The former atmosphere protects
Sr2Fe2O5 (x=2.5) against oxidation and the measurements in air allowed
variation of the composition of the oxide in the range 2.56 &#8804; x &#8804; 2.81.
Sr2Fe2O5 is an antiferromagnet and undergoes phase transitions to the paramagnetic 
state at 692K and from the orthorhombic to the cubic structure
around 1140K.The oxidized formof the ferrite also undergoes a transition
to the high-temperature cubic form.The author proposes a new structural
model for the cubic phase based on a unit cell with the Fm3c symmetry.
The new model allows a description of the high-temperature cubic form of
the ferrite as a solid solution of the composition end members.The results
were used to draw a phase diagramfor the SrFeOx system.

It consists of an analysis of the language of that discourse shaped by a belief that discourse is a rather neglected but potentially illuminating area of examination of language and literacy policy.  The study seeks to understand the processes and content of language policy as it is being made, or performed, and is influenced by a critique of the theory and practice of language policy which tends to adopt technicist paradigms of examination that insufficiently elucidate the politics of the field.    
&#182;
Accordingly a systematic gathering of the texts of language disputation in the US was collected.  These texts were organised in response to the methods of elicitation.  Semi-elicited texts, elicited texts and unelicited texts were gathered and tested to be sure that they constituted a fair representation of the concourse (what had been said and was being said about the issue) over a 15 year period.  Those statements, or texts, that had particular currency during the 104th Congress were selected for further use.  An empirical examination of the subjective dispositions of those activists involved in the making of official English, or of resisting the making of official English, was conducted.     
&#182;
This examination utilised the Q methodology (inverted factor analysis) invented by William Stephensen.  The data from this study provided a rich field of knowledge about the discursive parameters of the making of policy in synchronic and diachronic form.  Direct interviews were also conducted with participants, and discourse analysis of &#145;naturally occurring&#146; (unelicited texts) speeches and radio debates and other material of persuasion and disagreement was conducted.
&#182;
These data frame and produce a representation of the orders of discourse and their dynamic and shaping power.  Against an analysis of language policy making and a document analysis of the politics of language in the United States the discourses are utilised to contribute to a richer understanding of the field and the broad conclusion that as far as language policy is concerned it is hardly possible to make a distinction with political action. 
&#182;
The theoretical implications for a reinvigorated language policy theory constitute the latter part of the thesis.  In the multi-epistemological context that postmodernity demands, with its skepticism about the possibility of &#145;disinterest&#146;, the thesis offers its own kinds of data triangulation, and the making central of subjective dispositions and political purposes and engagements of the principal anatagonists.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language policy</field><field name="subject">planning and politics</field><field name="subject">US government</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">English language and multiculturalism</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020902.101758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examination Orientation and the Opportunity Structure in Chinese Education: Case Studies of Kunming High Schools</field><field name="creator">Simon, Louise</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the nature of education at the senior high school level in Kunming, China, through a participant observation study in four high schools.

The dissertation illustrates that the 'backwash effects' which are generated by the National University Entrance Examination are entrenched in the education system and have significant adverse effects on students and teachers. The academic and vocational streams of education are compared and contrasted as providing different paths through the opportunity structure and different outcomes for social mobility. The dissertation analyzes the selective and social distributive functions of senior high school education in Kunming, and suggests that informal methods outside of entrance examinations, such as the use of guanxi and monetary payments, are gaining influence in these realms.

In the fabrication of these devices, ion bombardment represents a very attractive technological tool. However, a successful application of ion implantation depends on an understanding of the effects of radiation damage. Hence, this thesis explores a number of fundamental aspects of radiation effects in wurtzite III-nitrides. Emphasis is given to an understanding of (i) the evolution of defect structures in III-nitrides during ion irradiation and (ii) the influence of ion bombardment on structural, mechanical, optical, and electrical properties of these materials.
&#182;
Structural characteristics of GaN bombarded with keV ions are studied by Rutherford backscattering/channeling (RBS/C) spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  Results show that strong dynamic annealing leads to a complex dependence of the damage buildup on ion species with preferential surface disordering. Such preferential surface disordering is due to the formation of surface amorphous layers, attributed to the trapping of mobile point defects by the GaN surface. Planar defects are formed for a wide range of implant conditions during bombardment. For some irradiation regimes, bulk disorder saturates below the amorphization level, and, with increasing ion dose, amorphization proceeds layer-by-layer only from the GaN surface. In the case of light ions, chemical effects of implanted species can strongly affect damage buildup. For heavier ions, an increase in the density of collision cascades strongly increases the level of stable implantation-produced lattice disorder. Physical mechanisms of surface and bulk amorphization and various defect interaction processes in GaN are discussed.

Structural studies by RBS/C, TEM, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveal anomalous swelling of implanted regions as a result of the formation of a porous structure of amorphous GaN. Results suggest that such a porous structure consists of N$_{2}$ gas bubbles embedded into a highly N-deficient amorphous GaN matrix. The evolution of the porous structure appears to be a result of stoichiometric imbalance, where N- and Ga-rich regions are produced by ion bombardment. Prior to amorphization, ion bombardment does not produce a porous structure due to efficient dynamic annealing in the crystalline phase.
&#182;
The influence of In and Al content on the accumulation of structural damage in InGaN and AlGaN under heavy-ion bombardment is studied by RBS/C and TEM. Results show that an increase in In concentration strongly suppresses dynamic annealing processes, while an increase in Al content dramatically enhances dynamic annealing. Lattice amorphization in AlN is not observed even for very large doses of keV heavy ions at -196 C.  In contrast to the case of GaN, no preferential surface disordering is observed in InGaN, AlGaN, and AlN. Similar implantation-produced defect structures are revealed by TEM in GaN, InGaN, AlGaN, and AlN. 
&#182;
The deformation behavior of GaN modified by ion bombardment is studied by spherical nanoindentation. Results show that implantation disorder significantly changes the mechanical properties of GaN. In particular, amorphous GaN exhibits plastic deformation even for very low loads with dramatically reduced values of hardness and Young's modulus compared to the values of as-grown GaN. Moreover, implantation-produced defects in crystalline GaN suppress the plastic component of deformation. 
&#182;
The influence of ion-beam-produced lattice defects as well as a range of implanted species on the luminescence properties of GaN is studied by cathodoluminescence (CL). Results indicate that intrinsic lattice defects mainly act as nonradiative recombination centers and do not give rise to yellow luminescence (YL). Even relatively low dose keV light-ion bombardment results in a dramatic quenching of visible CL emission. Postimplantation annealing at temperatures up to 1050 C generally causes a partial recovery of measured CL intensities. However, CL depth profiles indicate that, in most cases, such a recovery results from CL emission from virgin GaN, beyond the implanted layer, due to a reduction in the extent of light absorption within the implanted layer. Experimental data also shows that H, C, and O are involved in the formation of YL. The chemical origin of YL is discussed based on experimental data.
&#182;
Finally, the evolution of sheet resistance of GaN epilayers irradiated with MeV light ions is studied {\it in-situ}. Results show that the threshold dose of electrical isolation linearly depends on the original free electron concentration and is inversely proportional to the number of atomic displacements produced by the ion beam. Furthermore, such isolation is stable to rapid thermal annealing at temperatures up to 900 C. Results also show that both implantation temperature and ion beam flux can affect the process of electrical isolation. This behavior is consistent with significant dynamic annealing, which suggests a scenario where the centers responsible for electrical isolation are defect clusters and/or antisite-related defects. A qualitative model is proposed to explain temperature and flux effects.
&#182;
The work presented in this thesis has resulted in the identification and understanding of a number of both fundamental and technologically important ion-beam processes in III-nitrides. Most of the phenomena investigated are related to the nature and effects of implantation damage, such as lattice amorphization, formation of planar defects, preferential surface disordering, porosity, decomposition, and quenching of CL. These effects are often technologically undesirable, and the work of this thesis has indicated, in some cases, how such effects can be minimized or controlled. However, the thesis has also investigated one example where irradiation-produced defects can be successfully applied for a technological benefit, namely for electrical isolation of GaN-based devices. Finally, results of this thesis will clearly stimulate further research both to probe some of the mechanisms for unusual ion-induced effects and also to develop processes to avoid or repair unwanted lattice damage produced by ion bombardment.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GaN</field><field name="subject">AlGaN</field><field name="subject">InGaN</field><field name="subject">ion implantation</field><field name="subject">damage</field><field name="subject">defects</field><field name="subject">amorphization</field><field name="subject">annealing</field><field name="subject">cathodoluminescence</field><field name="subject">nanoindentation</field><field name="subject">electron microscopy</field><field name="subject">ion</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20030211.170915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inequality and Sustainability</field><field name="creator">Butler, Colin David</field><field name="description">Global civilisation, and therefore population health, is threatened by excessive inequality, weapons of mass destruction, inadequate economic and political theory and adverse global environmental change. The unequal distribution of global foreign exchange adjusted income is both a cause and a reflection of global social characteristics responsible for many aspects of these inter-related crises.
&#182;
The global distribution of foreign exchange adjusted income for the period 1964-1999 is examined. Using data for more than 99% of the global population, a substantial divergence in its distribution is found. The global Gini co-efficient, adjusted for national income inequality, increased from an already high value of 71% in 1964 to peak at more than 80% in 1995, before falling, very slightly, to 79% in 1999. The global distribution of purchasing parity power income is also examined, for a similar period. Though also found to be extremely unequal, its trend has not been to increased inequality. Implications of the differences between these two trends are discussed.
&#182;
A weighted time series index of global environmental change (IGEC) for the period 1960-1997 was also calculated. This uses nine categories of global time series environmental data, each scaled so that 100% represents the level of each category in nature prior to anthropogenic change; zero represents decline to a critical point. This index fell from 82% in 1960 to 55% in 1997, and will further decline during this century. 
&#182;
Using evidence from several disciplines, it is argued that the decline in the IGEC correlates with major macro-environmental changes, which, combined with flawed social responses to scarcity and its perception, place at risk the ability of civilisation to function. This could occur because of the interaction of conflict, economically disastrous extreme climatic events, deterioration of other ecosystem services, regional food and water insecurity, and currently unforeseen events. Uncertainty regarding both a safe rate of decline and the tolerable nadir of the IGEC is substantial.
&#182;
Substantial reduction in the inequality of foreign exchange adjusted income is vital to enhance the development of policies able to reverse the decline in the environmental goods which underpin civilisation, and to promote the co-operation needed to maximise the chance that civilisation will survive.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inequality</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">civilisation</field><field name="subject">causality</field><field name="subject">demography</field><field name="subject">carrying capacity</field><field name="subject">global environmental change</field><field name="subject">global income distribution</field><field name="subject">Kravis coefficient</field><field name="subject">purchasing power parity</field><field name="subject">caste system</field><field name="subject">demographic entrapment</field><field name="subject">ecological entrapment</field><field name="subject">environmental brinkmanship</field><field name="subject">scenarios</field><field name="subject">futures</field><field name="subject">fortress world</field><field name="subject">Boserup principle</field><field name="subject">stratospheric ozone depletion</field><field name="subject">index of global environmental change</field><field name="subject">IGEC</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20030324.171924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motherhood or abortion:
Pregnancy resolution decisions of Australian teenagers</field><field name="creator">Evans, Ann</field><field name="description">Australia has a lower teenage fertility rate than other industrialised English-speaking countries. However, with over 11,000 births and 12,000 abortions to teenagers each year, the resolution of teenage pregnancy is an issue faced by many young Australian women.
&#182;
This research seeks to explore the factors that discriminate between those who terminate and those who continue a teenage pregnancy. To achieve this aim a survey was conducted on young ever-pregnant women throughout New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. The survey sought information on young women&#146;s characteristics on three different levels: individual; institutional; and societal or cultural.
&#182;
The findings suggest that, at each of the three levels proposed, there are factors that discriminate between young women who choose abortion and those who choose motherhood. At the individual level, attitudes to abortion and career aspirations were found to affect pregnancy resolution. At the institutional level factors relating to education, family, relationships and religion were found to discriminate between the two groups. Finally, at the cultural level, ethnicity and area of residence were found to be associated with pregnancy resolution, in addition to modifying the effect of characteristics at other levels.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teenage pregnancy</field><field name="subject">abortion</field><field name="subject">termination</field><field name="subject">pregnancy resolution</field><field name="subject">motherhood</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20021028.105146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">About face : Asian representations of Australia</field><field name="creator">Broinowski, Alison Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the ways in which Australia has been publicly represented in ten Asian societies in the twentieth century. It shows how these representations are at odds with Australian opinion leaders&#146; assertions about being a multicultural society, with their claims about engagement with Asia, and with their understanding of what is &#145;typically&#146; Australian. It reviews the emergence and development of Asian regionalism in the twentieth century, and considers how Occidentalist strategies have come to be used to exclude and marginalise Australia. A historical survey outlines the origins of representations of Australia in each of the ten Asian countries, detecting the enduring influence both of past perceptions and of the interests of each country&#146;s opinion leaders. Three test cases evaluate these findings in the light of events in the late twentieth century: the first considers the response in the region to the One Nation party, the second compares that with opinion leaders&#146; reaction to the crisis in East Timor; and the third presents a synthesis of recent Asian Australian fiction and what it reveals about Asian representations of Australia from inside Australian society. The thesis concludes that Australian policies and practices enable opinion leaders in the ten countries to construct representations of Australia in accordance with their own priorities and concerns, and in response to their agendas of Occidentalism, racism, and regionalism.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Asians</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australians</field><field name="subject">image</field><field name="subject">representations</field><field name="subject">public opinion</field><field name="subject">opinion leaders</field><field name="subject">multicultural society</field><field name="subject">engagement with Asia</field><field name="subject">Occidentalism</field><field name="subject">regionalism</field><field name="subject">racism</field><field name="subject">Asianisation</field><field name="subject">the typical Australian</field><field name="subject">myths</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">Indians</field><field name="subject">Koreans</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asians</field><field name="subject">Indonesians</field><field name="subject">Filipinos</field><field name="subject">Malaysians</field><field name="subject">Singaporeans</field><field name="subject">Thais</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">twentieth century</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20030404.135751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy-Gradient Algorithms for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes</field><field name="creator">Aberdeen, Douglas Alexander</field><field name="description">Partially observable Markov decision processes are interesting because
of their ability to model most conceivable real-world learning
problems, for example, robot navigation, driving a car, speech
recognition, stock trading, and playing games. The downside of this
generality is that exact algorithms are computationally
intractable. Such computational complexity motivates approximate
approaches.  One such class of algorithms are the so-called
policy-gradient methods from reinforcement learning.  They seek to
adjust the parameters of an agent in the direction that maximises the
long-term average of a reward signal. Policy-gradient methods are
attractive as a \emph{scalable} approach for controlling partially
observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).
&#182;
In the most general case POMDP policies require some form of internal
state, or memory, in order to act optimally.  Policy-gradient methods
have shown promise for problems admitting memory-less policies but have
been less successful when memory is required.  This thesis develops
several improved algorithms for learning policies with memory in an
infinite-horizon setting. Directly, when the dynamics of the world
are known, and via Monte-Carlo methods otherwise.
The algorithms simultaneously learn how to act and what to remember.
&#182;
Monte-Carlo policy-gradient approaches tend to produce gradient
estimates with high variance. Two novel methods for reducing variance
are introduced. The first uses high-order filters to replace the
eligibility trace of the gradient estimator. The second uses a
low-variance value-function method to learn a subset of the parameters
and a policy-gradient method to learn the remainder.
&#182;
The algorithms are applied to large domains including a simulated
robot navigation scenario, a multi-agent scenario with 21,000 states,
and the complex real-world task of large vocabulary continuous speech
recognition. To the best of the author's knowledge, no other policy-gradient
algorithms have performed well at such  tasks.
&#182;
The high variance of Monte-Carlo methods requires lengthy simulation
and hence a super-computer to train agents within a reasonable time.  The ANU
``Bunyip'' Linux cluster was built with such tasks in mind. It was
used for several of the experimental results presented here.  One
chapter of this thesis describes an application written for the Bunyip
cluster that won the international Gordon-Bell prize for
price/performance in 2001.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">POMDP</field><field name="subject">Reinforcement Learning</field><field name="subject">Policy gradient</field><field name="subject">cluster</field><field name="subject">high performance computing</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20030410.111006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delamination Properties of a Vinyl-Ester/Glass Fibre Composite
Toughened by Particulate-Modified Interlayers</field><field name="creator">Stevanovic, Dejan</field><field name="description">The main aim of this work is to examine fracture toughness improvement mechanisms of a
composite material containing tough interlayers modified with large thermoplastic
particles.
&#182;
Various vinyl-ester (VE)/ poly(acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) (ABS) blends were used
for the interlayer-toughening of a VE/glass fibre composite to increase delamination
resistance of the material under mode I and mode II loading. Dry ABS powder was mixed
with the liquid resin in four different weight ratios: 3.5, 7, 11 and 15 phr (parts per
hundred parts of resin) while the layer thickness was varied from 150 to 500um.
Firstly, the tensile and mode I fracture toughness properties of the VE/ABS blends were
assessed, and, by using the Raman Spectroscopy technique, a chemical reaction was
discovered which occurred during ABS/VE mixing. This reaction consisted of butadiene
dissolution from the ABS particles into the VE. Also, butadiene saturation within the VE
was achieved at a composition of around 7% ABS particle content. Both mode I and mode II
fracture toughness of the composite were significantly improved with the application of
interlayers. Mode I fracture toughness GIc was found to be a function of
interlayer thickness and ABS particle content variations, with the latter dominating
GIc after the saturation point. Mode II fracture toughness was found to be
independent of interlayer thickness and only moderately influenced by particle content.
The toughening mechanisms that were the most influential within this interlayered
material  were plastic deformation and micro-cracking of the layer materials. Evidence of
both mechanisms was found using optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
&#182;
A numerical analysis was conducted, using the experimental results from this study, to
further explain the basic toughening mechanisms and fracture behaviour in the materials.
The aim of the analysis was to examine the influence of the particles on the plastic zone
size that develops in front of the crack tip, and the interaction between the particles
and the crack tip. For this purpose FEA elastic-plastic crack propagation models were
employed. Good agreement with the experimental data was found.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polymer composites</field><field name="subject">delamination</field><field name="subject">FEA</field><field name="subject">fracture mechanics</field><field name="subject">crack propagation</field><field name="subject">particles</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20030421.212730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Controlling the Dragon: An ethno-historical analysis of social engagement among the Kamoro of South-West New Guinea (Indonesian Papua/Irian Jaya)</field><field name="creator">Harple, Todd S</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how the Kamoro (also known as the Mimika) people of the south-west coast of Papua (former Irian Jaya), Indonesia have adapted to major political and economic changes over a long history of interactions with outsiders. More specifically, it is an ethnohistorical analysis of Kamoro strategies of engagement dating back to the seventeenth century, but focusing on the twentieth century. Taking ethnohistory to most generally refer to the investigation of the social and cultural distinctiveness of historical consciousness, this thesis examines how perceptions and activities of the past shape interpretations of the present. Though this thesis privileges Kamoro perspectives, it juxtaposes them against broader ethnohistorical analyses of the &#147;outsiders&#148; with whom they have interacted. For the Kamoro, amoko-kwere, narratives about the ancestral (and eternal) cultural heroes, underlie indigenous modes of historical consciousness which are ultimately grounded in forms of social reciprocity. One key characteristic of the amoko-kwere is the incorporation of foreign elements and their reformulation as products of indigenous agency. As a result of this reinterpretation expectations are raised concerning the exchange of foreign material wealth and abilities, both classified in the Kamoro language as kata. Foreign withholding of kata emerges as a dominant theme in amoko-kwere and is interpreted as theft, ultimately establishing relationships of negative reciprocity between the Kamoro and the powerful outsiders. These feelings are mirrored in contemporary Kamoro conceptions of their relationships with the Indonesian State and the massive PT Freeport Indonesia Mining Company who use a significant amount of Kamoro land for deposition of mining waste (tailings) and for the development of State and company infrastructure.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kamoro</field><field name="subject">Mimika</field><field name="subject">South-West New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Indonesian Papua</field><field name="subject">Irian Jaya</field><field name="subject">political change</field><field name="subject">economic change</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">ethnohistory</field><field name="subject">strategies of engagement</field><field name="subject">historical consciousness</field><field name="subject">amoko-kwere</field><field name="subject">PT Freeport Indonesia Mining Company</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20030401.173221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Religious Attendance and Affiliation Patterns in Australia
1966 to 1996
The Dichotomy of Religious Identity and Practice</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, John Malcolm</field><field name="description">The period between 1966 and 1996 was a period of great change for society in Australia. Two particular aspects of that change have been highlighted in this study. It will examine the changing patterns of attendance at religious services and religious affiliation over this time period. In particular it examines the connection of attendance and belief patterns, which have changed during this period, with particular reference to Christian religious groups. &#182;
By examining data from each of the Censuses in the period between 1966 and 1996 it was possible to note three fundamental changes in the patterns of religious affiliation. The first was the movement away from patterns of Christian affiliation to no religious affiliation. The second was the shift of migration patterns which drew substantially from Europe in the period prior to 1971 to a pattern with higher levels of migration from Asia and Oceania. The third saw a decline in Christian affiliation among the 15-24 age group. &#182;
After analysing this affiliation data a weekly average religious attendance measure was composed to compare data from each of the social science surveys. This made it possible to examine generational trends by age and sex which resulted from changing patterns of affiliation, immigration, stability of residence and marital status  Also a case study of the Canberra parishes in the Catholic Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn was undertaken to examine the particular impact that these changes had on a particular religious grouping. &#182;
In studying these indicators it is believed that the change in patterns of Australian religious attendance and affiliation while influenced by life course events has also been substantially affected by issues of generational change. These changes not only produce lower levels of  religious attendance but also have significant impact on aspects of society which have sustained communal life.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religious Attendance</field><field name="subject">Religious Affiliation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Marriage</field><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020729.140410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation Studies of Biological Ion Channels</field><field name="creator">Corry, Ben Alexander</field><field name="description">Biological ion channels are responsible for, and regulate the
communication system in the body.  In this thesis I develop, test and
apply theoretical models of ion channels, that can relate their
structure to their functional properties.  Brownian dynamics
simulations are introduced, in which the motions of individual ions
are simulated as they move through the channel and in baths attached
to each end. The techniques for setting boundary conditions which
maintain ion concentrations in the baths and provide a driving
potential are tested. Provided the bath size is large enough, all
boundary conditions studied yield the same results.
&#182;
Continuum theories of electrolytes have previously been used to study
ion permeation. However, I show that these continuum models do not
accurately reproduce the physics taking place inside ion channels by
directly comparing the results of both equilibrium Poisson-Boltzmann
theory, and non-equilibrium Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory to
simulations.  In both cases spurious shielding effects are found to
cancel out forces that play an important role in ion permeation. In
particular, the `reaction field' created by the ion entering the
narrow channel is underestimated. Attempts to correct these problems
by adding extra force terms to account for this reaction field also
fail.
&#182;
A model of the L-type calcium channel is presented and studied using
Brownian dynamics simulations and electrostatic calculations. The
mechanisms of permeation and selectivity are explained as the result
of simple electrostatic interactions between ions and the fixed
charges in the protein. The complex conductance properties of the
channel, including the current-voltage and current-concentration
relationships, the anomalous mole fraction behaviour between sodium
and calcium ions, the attenuation of calcium currents by monovalent
ions and the effects of mutating glutamate residues, are all
reproduced.
&#182;
Finally, the simulation and electrostatic calculation methods are used
to study the gramicidin A channel. It is found that the continuum
electrostatic calculations break down in this narrow channel, as the
concept of applying a uniform dielectric constant is not accurate in
this situation. Thus, the permeation properties of the channel are
examined using Brownian dynamics simulations without electrostatic
calculations.  Future applications and improvements of the Brownian
dynamics simulation technique are also described.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biophysics</field><field name="subject">ion channels</field><field name="subject">computer simulation</field><field name="subject">stochastic dynamics</field><field name="subject">continuum electrostatics</field><field name="subject">biological simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20030423.162927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of Quantum Electro-Optic Control and Squeezed Light</field><field name="creator">Lam, Ping Koy</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we report the observations of optical squeezing from second harmonic generation (SHG), optical parametric oscillation (OPO) and optical parametric amplification (OPA). Demonstrations and proposals of applications involving the squeezed light and electro-optic control loops are presented.
&#182;
In our SHG setup, we report the observation of 2.1 dB of intensity squeezing on the second harmonic (SH) output. Investigations into the system show that the squeezing performance of a SHG system is critically affected by the pump noise and a modular theory of noise propagation is developed to describe and quantify this effect. Our experimental data has also shown that in a low-loss SHG system, intra-cavity nondegenerate OPO modes can simultaneously occur. This competition of nonlinear processes leads to the optical clamping of the SH output power and in general can degrade the SH squeezing. We model this competition and show that it imposes a limit to the observable SH squeezing. Proposals for minimizing the effect of competition are presented.
&#182;
In our OPO setup, we report the observation of 7.1 dB of vacuum squeezing and more than 4 dB of intensity squeezing when the OPO is operating as a parametric amplifier. We present the design criteria and discuss the limits to the observable squeezing from the OPO.We attribute the large amount of squeezing obtained in our experiment to the high escape efficiency of the OPO. The effect of phase jitter on the squeezing of the vacuum state is modeled.
&#182;
The quantum noise performance of an electro-optic feedforward control loop is investigated. With classical coherent inputs, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations introduced at the beam splitter of the control loop can be completely cancelled by an optimum amount of positive feedforward. The cancellation of vacuum fluctuations leads to the possibility of noiseless signal amplification with the feedforward loop. Comparison shows that the feedforward amplifier is superior or at least comparable in performance with other noiseless amplification schemes. When combined with an injection-locked non-planar ring Nd:YAG laser, we demonstrate that signal and power amplifications can both be noiseless and independently variable.
&#182;
Using squeezed inputs to the feedforward control loop, we demonstrate that information carrying squeezed states can be made robust to large downstream transmission losses via a noiseless signal amplification. We show that the combination of a squeezed vacuum meter input and a feedforward loop is a quantum nondemolition (QND) device, with the feedforward loop providing an additional improvement on the transfer of signal. In general, the use of a squeezed vacuum meter input and an electro-optic feedforward loop can provide pre- and post- enhancements to many existing QND schemes.
&#182;
Finally, we proposed that the quantum teleportation of a continuous-wave optical state can be achieved using a pair of phase and amplitude electro-optic feedforward loops with two orthogonal quadrature squeezed inputs. The signal transfer and quantum correlation of the teleported optical state are analysed. We show that a two dimensional diagram, similar to the QND figures of merits, can be used to quantify the performance of a teleporter.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum electro-optic control</field><field name="subject">squeezed light</field><field name="subject">quantum optics</field><field name="subject">optical squeezing</field><field name="subject">second harmonic generation</field><field name="subject">optical parametric oscillation</field><field name="subject">optical parametric amplification</field><field name="subject">noiseless amplification</field><field name="subject">feedforward control loop</field><field name="subject">quantum nondemolition device</field><field name="subject">teleportation</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20030611.170800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pharisees, Jesus and the kingdom : Divine Royal Presence as exegetical key to Luke 17:20-21</field><field name="creator">Letchford, Roderick R.</field><field name="description">The quest for the historical Jesus can be advanced by a consideration of disagreement scenarios recorded in the gospels. Such &#147;conflicts&#148; afford the opportunity not only to analyse the positions of the protagonists, but by comparing them, to better appreciate their relative stances.  &#182;
	One area of disagreement that has remained largely unexplored is that between Jesus and the Pharisees over the &#147;kingdom of God&#148;. Indeed, &#147;kingdom of God&#148; formed the very foundation of Jesus&#146; preaching and thus ought to be the place where fundamental disagreements are to be found. As Luke 17:20-21 represents the only passage in the Gospels where the Pharisees show any interest in the kingdom of God, it forms the central hub of the thesis around which an account of the disparate beliefs of Jesus and the Pharisees on the kingdom of God is constructed.  &#182;
	The main thesis is this. Luke 17:20-21 can best be explained, at the level of the Pharisees and Jesus, as betraying a fundamental disagreement, not in the identity of the kingdom of God, which they both regarded as primarily the Divine Royal Presence, i.e. God himself as king, but in the location of that kingdom. The Pharisees located the kingdom in the here-and-now, Jesus located it in heaven. Conversely, at later stages in the formation of the pericope, the pre-Lukan community identified the kingdom as the Holy Spirit located in individuals with faith in Jesus and the redactor identified the kingdom as Jesus, located both in the Historical Jesus and the Jesus now in heaven.  &#182;
	Chapter 1, after the usual preliminary remarks, presents an analysis of Luke 17:20-21 as a chreia, a literary form ideally suited as the basis on which to compare the beliefs of the Pharisees and Jesus. The work of three scholars vital to the development of the main thesis is then reviewed and evaluated. By way of background, a portrait of the Pharisees is then presented, highlighting in particular, issues that will be of importance in later chapters. Finally, a section on the Aramaic Targums suggests that some targum traditions may be traced back prior to AD 70 and that these reflect the influence and beliefs of first century Palestinian Pharisees.  &#182;
	Chapters 2 and 3 are a consideration of every instance of the explicit mention of God as king (or his kingship) and the Divine Kingdom respectively, in contemporary and earlier Jewish Palestinian literature and in Luke-Acts. A model of the kingdom of God is developed in these chapters that will be applied to Luke 17:20-21 in the next chapter.  &#182;

In the introductory chapter, I outline my theoretical framework, which expands political ecology by applying insights from micropolitical theory to a focus on intracommunity disputes surrounding natural resource exploitation projects.  I argue that such a close examination is necessary if we are to understand local tensions and factions and their multiple influences on the outcomes of development projects.  &#182;
The Koniambo Project promises to redress some of the economic imbalances prevalent in the archipelago by benefiting the largely Kanak, and historically underprivileged, Northern Province.  Thus, this mining project has great politico-economic significance, both for pro-independence leaders as well as for those who wish to maintain New Caledonia as a part of France.  However, while people expected benefits for the Kanak people as a whole, the project sparked intracommunity conflicts at the local level.  I argue that villagers&#146; claims to the right to authorize mining activities as well as their desires to receive recognition from the mining company reflected their eagerness to prove a high social position.  Meanwhile, in line with the traditionally competitive political climate within Kanak communities, there were many debates about who exactly the &#145;landowners&#146; were.  Indeed, the project&#146;s potential to disrupt or reinforce control over land &#150; which, unlike material goods, was a socially acceptable object of overt rivalry &#150; created unexpected socio-political stakes.  These differential micropolitical possibilities shaped people&#146;s discourses about the project&#146;s other impacts.  For instance, those who expected to be able to access employment opportunities as well as social recognition from the mining project were more inclined not to worry about the project&#146;s consequences for natural/cultural resources.  Similarly, Voh-Kon&#233; area villagers&#146; statements and actions regarding dangers from spirits or forbidden places were strongly influenced by their expectations of the project&#146;s ability to strengthen or weaken their social status, as determined by their genealogies and proven through demonstrations of their relationships to their ancestors. &#182;
In the final chapter, I provide a summary of my conclusions about the micropolitics behind local community members&#146; engagements with the Koniambo Project.  Next I explain how, while this case itself is unique due to the project&#146;s unusual politico-economic significance, the theoretical framework and methodology outlined in this thesis can help to create balanced, nuanced analyses of intracommunity diversity and micropolitical conflicts that objectively yet sympathetically portray local people as real human beings.  Finally, I suggest new directions for further research on the interactions of mining companies and local communities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Caledonia</field><field name="subject">Kanak</field><field name="subject">mining</field><field name="subject">micropolitics</field><field name="subject">political ecology</field><field name="subject">Voh-Kon&#233;</field><field name="subject">Koniambo Project</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20031015.150235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early maladaptive schemas and cognitive distortions in psychopathy and narcissism</field><field name="creator">Torres, Cristian</field><field name="description">Personality disorders have traditionally been considered refractory to psychological interventions. Two of the most common, and potentially harmful personality disorders are antisocial personality disorder / psychopathy, and narcissism. Although a great deal of conceptual overlap exists between psychopathy and narcissism, the empirical study of these constructs has proceeded largely independently of one another. Further complicating the discrimination of these constructs is the identification of the bi-factorial nature of psychopathy - conceptualised as primary and secondary psychopathy - as well as the identification of two distinct forms of narcissism, overt and covert. The recent resurgence of interest in the sub-clinical manifestations of these two constructs has led to the development of a number of easily administered instruments to measure each of the psychopathy and narcissism constructs, as dimensional traits, within normal populations. This has provided empirically validated and reliable instruments to further explicate these two overlapping constructs. The first of the two studies reported sought to discriminate between psychopathy and narcissism through the recharacterisation of these constructs in terms of the early maladaptive schemas outlined in Young&#146;s early maladaptive schema theory (Young, 1999). Two hundred and ninety one participants completed questionnaires measuring primary and secondary psychopathy, overt and covert narcissism, and early maladaptive schemas. Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that psychopathy and narcissism are discriminable in cognitive-interpersonal terms, as operationalised by early maladaptive schemas. Findings also call into question the earlier observed hierarchical structure of the Young Schema Questionnaire. The current analysis identified a two-factor structure to the schema questionnaire, rather than the previously stated 5-factors. Having demonstrated the usefulness of understanding psychopathy and narcissism in cognitive-interpersonal terms, the second study sought to further clarify the association between psychopathy and narcissism through the reconceptualisation of these constructs in cognitive terms, through the identification of the cognitive distortions operative in each disorder. One hundred and thirty two participants completed a cognitive distortions questionnaire developed by the author, along with the same measures of primary and secondary psychopathy, and overt and covert narcissism, as those administered in study 1. Findings were interpreted as providing support for the notion of psychopathy representing a sub-category of narcissism. Findings also provide further supportive evidence for the validity of the primary / secondary psychopathy, and overt / covert narcissism distinctions. The further clarification of the factor structure of the Young Schema Questionnaire, and the replication of the reliability and construct validity of the measure of cognitive distortions developed for this research are highlighted as areas for future research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychopathy</field><field name="subject">narcissism</field><field name="subject">early maladaptive schemas</field><field name="subject">cognitive distortions</field><field name="subject">personality disorders</field><field name="subject">antisocial personality disorder</field><field name="subject">APD</field><field name="subject">narcissistic personality disorder</field><field name="subject">NPD</field><field name="subject">interpersonal</field><field name="subject">schema theory</field><field name="subject">schema therapy</field><field name="subject">EMS</field><field name="subject">cognitive theory</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20031107.130315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data Surveillance:  Theory, Practice &amp; Policy</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Roger Anthony</field><field name="description">Data surveillance is the systematic use of personal data systems in the investigation or monitoring of the actions or communications of one or more persons.

When was it first created? By whom, and for what intended audience? By what process did it proliferate into the many variant texts that have come down to us? How many other variants may once have existed? What is the relationship between the existing variants, and which can be considered the earliest? Might this be the &#147;original text&#148;, or is it too a reworking of some now lost original text?
&#182;
In the last forty years, these questions have been taken up by a number of scholars, but to date there has been no full-length study that takes into account the wide range of variant texts and attempts in any systematic way to analyze them in a search for answers. The present study seeks to fill this gap. I compare 11 texts, consisting of representatives from all the main variant categories and including all the texts which are known to be, or which seem to me to be, early forms. Detailed textual comparison can be found in Appendix 1.
&#182;
Part I introduces the background to the Tale&#146;s development, and the variant texts. In Part II, I translate the variant known as Bunmeibon. Many scholars have either claimed or simply assumed that Bunmeibon is a close version of the Tale&#146;s original form. I take issue with this belief, and one of the aims of this study is to pursue the question of the relationship of the B text line (of which Bunmeibon is representative) with the A text line, which has generally been regarded as the secondary or &#147;abridged&#148; line, with the purpose of establishing that it is rather the A line that retains traces of the original text and of the impulses that led to the Tale&#146;s original formation.
&#182;
The detailed comments which follow each section of the Bunmeibon translation are intended both to place it within the context of the other ten variants and draw out their possible relationships, and to examine other issues that the section raises in relation to the Tale as a whole. Most of these issues hinge on the question of how Saigyo is depicted. I trace the volatile shifts that occur between the two poles of Saigyo as poet and Saigyo as religious practitioner, how the Tale does and does not attempt to merge the two, and what forms this double Saigyo image takes as the Tale progresses, both inter- and intra-textually.
&#182;
This question is fundamentally linked with the above question of relationship between the text lines. The scholars who focus their study on Bunmeibon largely assume that the main focus of the Tale is religious in intent. I hope to show that the Tale&#146;s fundamental form in all variants does not reflect this, that much of the religious material found in Bunmeibon and the other B texts is the result of interpolation and reworking, and that it is the early A texts&#146; more literary focus that contains the likely key to the original impulses behind the Tale&#146;s formation.
&#182;
Part III draws together the results of my investigation, and situates the Tale within the wider context of the kyogen kigo debate.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saigyo monogatari</field><field name="subject">Tale of Saigyo</field><field name="subject">Bunmeibon</field><field name="subject">kyogen kigo debate</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040429.162641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inverse Modelling of Trace Gas Exchange at Canopy and Regional Scales</field><field name="creator">Styles, Julie Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the estimation of plant-atmosphere trace gas exchange and isotopic discrimination from atmospheric concentration measurements. Two space scales were investigated: canopy and regional. The canopy-scale study combined a Lagrangian model of turbulent dispersal with ecophysiological principles to infer vertical profiles of fluxes of CO2, H2O and heat as well as carbon and oxygen isotope discrimination during CO2 assimilation, from concentration measurements within a forest. The regional-scale model used a convective boundary layer budget approach to infer average regional isotopic discrimination and fluxes of CO2 and sensible and latent heat from the evolution during the day of boundary layer height and mean concentrations of CO2 and H2O, temperature and carbon and oxygen isotope composition of CO2.

For the canopy study, concentrations of five scalar quantities, CO2, 13CO2, C18O16O, H2O and temperature, were measured at up to nine heights within and above a mixed fir and spruce forest in central Siberia over several days just after snow melt in May 2000. Eddy covariance measurements of CO2, H2O and heat fluxes were made above the canopy over the same period, providing independent verification of the model flux estimates. Photosynthesis, transpiration, heat exchange and isotope discrimination during CO2 assimilation were modelled for sun and shade leaves throughout the canopy through a combination of inversion of the concentration data and principles of biochemistry, plant physiology and energy balance. 

In contrast to the more usual inverse modelling concept where fluxes are inferred directly from concentrations, in this study the inversion was used to predict unknown parameters within a process-based model of leaf gas and energy exchange. Parameters relating to photosynthetic capacity, stomatal conductance, radiation penetration and turbulence structure were optimised by the inversion to provide the best fit of modelled to measured concentration profiles of the five scalars. Model results showed that carbon isotope discrimination, stomatal conductance and intercellular CO2 concentration were depressed due to the low temperatures experienced during snow melt, oxygen isotope discrimination was positive and consistent with other estimates, radiation penetrated further than simple theoretical predictions because of leaf clumping and penumbra, the turbulence coherence was lower than expected and stability effects were important in the morning and evening.

For the regional study, five flights were undertaken over two days in and above the convective boundary layer above a heterogeneous pine forest and bog region in central Siberia. Vertical profiles of CO2 and H2O concentrations, temperature and pressure were obtained during each flight. Air flask samples were taken at various heights for carbon and oxygen isotopic analysis of CO2. Two budget methods were used to estimate regional surface fluxes of CO2 and plant isotopic discrimination against 13CO2 and C18O16O, with the first method also used to infer regional sensible and latent heat fluxes. Flux estimates were compared to ground-based eddy covariance measurements. Model results showed that afternoon estimates for carbon and oxygen isotope discrimination were close to those expected from source water isotopic measurements and theory of isotope discrimination. Estimates for oxygen isotope discrimination for the morning period were considerably different and could be explained by contrasting influences of the two different ecosystem types and non-steady state evaporative enrichment of leaf water.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbon dioxide flux</field><field name="subject">water use efficiency</field><field name="subject">thermal stability</field><field name="subject">atmospheric boundary layer budget</field><field name="subject">regional flux</field><field name="subject">multiple constraints</field><field name="subject">data assimilation</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20030905.040030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface, Emitter and Bulk Recombination in Silicon and Development of Silicon Nitride Passivated Solar Cells</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Mark John</field><field name="description">[Some symbols cannot be rendered in the following metadata &#150; please see the PDF file for an accurate version of the Abstract]
&#182;
Recombination within the bulk and at the surfaces of crystalline silicon has been
investigated in this thesis. Special attention has been paid to the surface passivation achievable
with plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposited (PECVD) silicon nitride (SiN) films due to
their potential for widespread use in silicon solar cells. The passivation obtained with thermally
grown silicon oxide (SiO2) layers has also been extensively investigated for comparison.
&#182;
Injection-level dependent lifetime measurements have been used throughout this thesis to
quantify the different recombination rates in silicon. New techniques for interpreting the
effective lifetime in terms of device characteristics have been introduced, based on the physical
concept of a net photogeneration rate. The converse relationships for determining the effective
lifetime from measurements of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) under arbitrary illumination have
also been introduced, thus establishing the equivalency of the photoconductance and voltage
techniques, both quasi-static and transient, by allowing similar possibilities for all of them.
&#182;
The rate of intrinsic recombination in silicon is of fundamental importance. It has been
investigated as a function of injection level for both n-type and p-type silicon, for dopant
densities up to ~5x1016cm-3. Record high effective lifetimes, up to 32ms for high resistivity
silicon, have been measured. Importantly, the wafers where commercially sourced and had
undergone significant high temperature processing. A new, general parameterisation has been
proposed for the rate of band-to-band Auger recombination in crystalline silicon, which
accurately fits the experimental lifetime data for arbitrary injection level and arbitrary dopant
density. The limiting efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells has been re-evaluated using this
new parameterisation, with the effects of photon recycling included.
&#182;
Surface recombination processes in silicon solar cells are becoming progressively more
important as industry drives towards thinner substrates and higher cell efficiencies. The surface
recombination properties of well-passivating SiN films on p-type and n-type silicon have been
comprehensively studied, with Seff values as low as 1cm/s being unambiguously determined.
The well-passivating SiN films optimised in this thesis are unique in that they are stoichiometric
in composition, rather than being silicon rich, a property which is attributed to the use of dilute
silane as a process gas. A simple physical model, based on recombination at the Si/SiN interface
being determined by a high fixed charge density within the SiN film (even under illumination),
has been proposed to explain the injection-level dependent Seff for a variety of differently doped
wafers. The passivation obtained with the optimised SiN films has been compared to that
obtained with high temperature thermal oxides (FGA and alnealed) and the limits imposed by
surface recombination on the efficiency of SiN passivated solar cells investigated. It is shown
that the optimised SiN films show little absorption of UV photons from the solar spectrum and
can be easily patterned by photolithography and wet chemical etching.
&#182;
The recombination properties of n+ and p+ emitters passivated with optimised SiN films
and thermal SiO2 have been extensively studied over a large range of emitter sheet resistances.
Both planar and random pyramid textured surfaces were studied for n+ emitters, where the
optimised SiN films were again found to be stoichiometric in composition. The optimised SiN
films provided good passivation of the heavily doped n+-Si/SiN interface, with the surface
recombination velocity increasing from 1400cm/s to 25000cm/s as the surface concentration of
electrically active phosphorus atoms increased from 7.5x1018cm-3 to 1.8x1020cm-3. The
optimised SiN films also provided reasonable passivation of industrial n+ emitters formed in a
belt-line furnace. It was found that the surface recombination properties of SiN passivated p+
emitters was poor and was worst for sheet resistances of ~150./ . The hypothesis that
recombination at the Si/SiN interface is determined by a high fixed charge density within the
SiN films was extended to explain this dependence on sheet resistance. The efficiency potential
of SiN passivated n+p cells has been investigated, with a sheet resistance of 80-100./  and a
base resistivity of 1-2.cm found to be optimal. Open-circuit voltages of 670-680mV and
efficiencies up to ~20% and ~23% appear possible for SiN passivated planar and textured cells
respectively. The recombination properties measured for emitters passivated with SiO2, both n+
and p+, were consistent with other studies and found to be superior to those obtained with SiN
passivation.
&#182;
Stoichiometric SiN films were used to passivate the front and rear surfaces of various
solar cell structures. Simplified PERC cells fabricated on 0.3.cm p-type silicon, with either a
planar or random pyramid textured front surface, produced high Voc&#146;s of 665-670mV and
conversion efficiencies up to 19.7%, which are amongst the highest obtained for SiN passivated
solar cells. Bifacial solar cells fabricated on planar, high resistivity n-type substrates (20.cm)
demonstrated Voc&#146;s up to 675mV, the highest ever reported for an all-SiN passivated cell, and
excellent bifaciality factors. Planar PERC cells fabricated on gettered 0.2.cm multicrystalline
silicon have also demonstrated very high Voc&#146;s of 655-659mV and conversion efficiencies up to
17.3% using a single layer anti-reflection coating. Short-wavelength internal quantum efficiency
measurements confirmed the excellent passivation achieved with the optimised stoichiometric
SiN films on n+ emitters, while long-wavelength measurements show that there is a loss of
short-circuit current at the rear surface of SiN passivated p-type cells. The latter loss is
attributed to parasitic shunting, which arises from an inversion layer at the rear surface due to
the high fixed charge (positive) density in the SiN layers. It has been demonstrated that that a
simple way to reduce the impact of the parasitic shunt is to etch away some of the silicon from
the rear contact dots. An alternative is to have locally diffused p+ regions under the rear
contacts, and a novel method to form a rear structure consisting of a local Al-BSF with SiN
passivation elsewhere, without using photolithography, has been demonstrated.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface</field><field name="subject">emitter</field><field name="subject">bulk</field><field name="subject">recombination</field><field name="subject">silicon nitride passivated solar cells</field><field name="subject">passivation</field><field name="subject">SiN</field><field name="subject">crystalline silicon solar cells</field><field name="subject">silicon oxide</field><field name="subject">SiO2</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040527.152717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Transfer to Transformation: Rethinking the Relationship between Research and Policy</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Brendan John Joseph</field><field name="description">The most common and enduring explanation for the way research is used (or abused or not used) in policy is the &#145;two communities&#146; theory. According to this theory, the problematic relationship between research and policy is caused by the different &#145;cultures&#146; inhabited by policy makers and researchers. The most common and enduring types of strategies that are put forward to increase research use in policy involve bridging or linking these &#145;two communities&#146;. This study challenges this way of thinking about the relationship between research and policy. Four case studies of national public health policy in Australia&#151;breast cancer screening, prostate cancer screening, needle and syringe programs in the community, and needle and syringe programs in prisons&#151;are used to present the context, events, processes, research, and actors involved in policy making. Three theories are deployed to explore the relationship between research and policy in each of the cases individually and across the cases as a whole. These theories bring different determinants and dynamics of the relationship to light and each is at least partially successful in increasing our understanding of the relationship between research and policy. The Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) understands the relationship in terms of a power struggle between competing coalitions that use research as a political resource in the policy process. The Policy Making Organisation Framework (PMOF) understands the relationship in terms of institutional and political factors that determine the way data is selected or rejected from the policy process. The Governmentality Framework (GF) understands the relationship in terms of the Foucauldian construct of power/knowledge that is created through discourse, &#145;regimes of truth&#146; and &#145;regimes of practices&#146; found in public health policy and research. This study has found that in three of the four case studies, public health policy was strongly influenced by research, the exception being NSP in prisons. In all cases, however, it is not possible to construct a robust and coherent account of the policy process or the policy outcome without considering the multifaceted role of research. When these theories are explored at a more fundamental level they support the argument that when research influences policy it is transformed into knowledge-for-policy by being invested with meaning and power. This process of transformation occurs through social and political action that mobilises ideal structures (such as harm minimisation and the World Health Organisation&#146;s principles for evaluating screening programs) and material structures (such as medical journals and government advisory bodies) to resolve meta-policy problems (such as how to define complex public health problems in a way that makes them amenable to empirical research and practical action). This study provides good evidence that the notion of &#145;research transfer&#146; between &#145;two communities&#146; is a flawed way of understanding the research&#150;policy relationship. Rethinking the relationship between research and policy involves building an enhanced theoretical repertoire for understanding this complex social interaction. This step is essential to the success of future efforts to make public health policy that is effective, just and emancipatory. This study makes a contribution to this task.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">policy makers</field><field name="subject">policy making</field><field name="subject">meta-policy</field><field name="subject">national public health policy</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">breast cancer screening</field><field name="subject">prostate cancer screening</field><field name="subject">needle and syringe programs</field><field name="subject">prisons</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040528.165124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Curve Estimation and Signal Discrimination in Spatial Problems</field><field name="creator">Rau, Christian</field><field name="description">In many instances arising prominently, but not exclusively, in imaging problems, it is important to condense the salient information so as to obtain a low-dimensional approximant of the data. This thesis is concerned with two basic situations which call for such a dimension reduction. The first of these is the statistical recovery of smooth edges in regression and density surfaces. The edges are understood to be contiguous curves, although they are allowed to meander almost arbitrarily through the plane, and may even split at a finite number of points to yield an edge graph. A novel locally-parametric nonparametric method is proposed which enjoys the benefit of being relatively easy to implement via a `tracking' approach. These topics are discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, with pertaining background material being given in the Appendix. In Chapter 4 we construct concomitant confidence bands for this estimator, which have asymptotically correct coverage probability. The construction can be
likened to only a few existing approaches, and may thus be considered as our main contribution. 
&#182;
Chapter 5 discusses numerical issues pertaining to the edge and confidence band estimators of Chapters 2-4. Connections are drawn to popular topics which originated in the fields of computer vision and signal processing, and which surround edge detection. These connections are exploited so as to obtain greater robustness of the likelihood estimator, such as with the presence of sharp corners.
&#182;
Chapter 6 addresses a dimension reduction problem for spatial data where the ultimate objective of the analysis is the discrimination of these data into one of a few pre-specified groups. In the dimension reduction step, an instrumental role is played by the recently
developed methodology of functional data analysis. Relatively standar non-linear image processing techniques, as well as wavelet shrinkage, are used prior to this step.  A case study for remotely-sensed navigation radar data exemplifies the methodology of Chapter 6.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boundary estimation</field><field name="subject">edge detection</field><field name="subject">image analysis</field><field name="subject">jump</field><field name="subject">locally parametric methods</field><field name="subject">response surface</field><field name="subject">smoothing</field><field name="subject">classification</field><field name="subject">functional data analysis</field><field name="subject">Karhunen-Loeve expansion</field><field name="subject">principal components</field><field name="subject">signal analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20031215.163519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into Satisfiability Search</field><field name="creator">Slater, Andrew</field><field name="description">In this dissertation we investigate theoretical aspects of some practical approaches used
in solving and understanding search problems.  We concentrate on the Satisfiability
problem, which is a strong representative from search problem domains.  The work develops
general theoretical foundations to investigate some practical aspects of satisfiability
search.  This results in a better understanding of the fundamental mechanics for search
algorithm construction and behaviour.  A theory of choice or branching heuristics is
presented, accompanied by results showing a correspondence of both parameterisations and
performance when the method is compared to previous empirically motivated branching
techniques.  The logical foundations of the backtracking mechanism are explored alongside formulations for reasoning in relevant logics which results in the development of a
malleable backtracking mechanism that subsumes other intelligent backtracking proof
construction techniques and allows the incorporation of proof rearrangement strategies.
Moreover, empirical tests show that relevant backtracking outperforms all other forms of
intelligent backtracking search tree construction methods.  An investigation into
modelling and generating world problem instances justifies a modularised problem model proposal which is used experimentally to highlight the practicability of search algorithms

It uses microsimulation modelling to derive an optimally cost-effective screening protocol for various combinations of the available screening tests. &#182;
First a mathematical model for the natural history of colorectal cancer is derived, based on analyses of Australian population and hospital-based cancer registries combined with data from published studies. Then a model for population based screening is derived based mainly on data from published screening studies, including the four major published randomised controlled trials of faecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening. These two models are used to simulate the application of a screening programme to the Australian population. The simulations are applied to a period of 40 years following 1990 (the study&#146;s base year), with both costs and benefits discounted back to the base year at an annual rate of 3%.&#182;

The models are applied to simulating a population screening programme based on FOBT with a colonoscopy follow up of positive tests. This simulation suggests that the optimal application of such a programme would be to offer annual screening to people aged 50 to 84 years. Such a programme would lead to a cumulative fall in years of life lost to colorectal cancer (YLL) of 28.5% at a cost per year of life saved (YLS) of $8,987. These costs and benefits are consistent with those arising from other currently funded health interventions. They are also consistent with the cost per YLS which Australian governments appear willing to pay for health interventions when justified on the basis of cost-effectiveness. The fall in colorectal cancer deaths from this screening programme should be first detectable by a national monitoring system after around three years of screening. However the full benefits from screening would not be realised before around 30 years of screening.&#182;

These simulations are based on the standard guaiac FOBT, but the results suggest that significant cost-effective gains could be made by using the newer immunochemical FOBT. Further cost-effect gains could be made by offering sigmoidoscopy every five years in addition to annual FOBT.&#182;

The models are then applied to simulating population screening programmes using colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy as primary screening tools. Offering colonoscopy every ten years to all people aged from 45 to 85 leads to an overall fall in cumulative YLL of 37.6%, at a cost of $15,585 per YLS. Offering sigmoidoscopy every three years to all people aged 40 to 85 leads to an overall fall in cumulative YLL of 29.1%, at a cost of $4,862 per YLS. Both of these cost and benefit results are also consistent with the cost per YLS which Australian governments appear willing to pay. The fall in deaths with colonoscopy screening would also be detectable after three years of screening but the fall with sigmoidoscopy screening would not be detectable until after six years of screening. Sigmoidoscopy would need around 35 years of screening to reach its potential gains while colonoscopy screening would not reach its full potential during the 40 year screening period.&#182;

Finally the models are applied to targeting people at higher risk of cancer. The results show that offering colonoscopy every five years to people at higher risk because of a family history of colorectal cancer is a cost-effective addition to the annual FOBT screening programme.&#182;

I begin with The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir's application of existentialism to women. I expose the problems that arise in Beauvoir's project. Woman's body is an obstacle to her transcendence, and further, she must abandon her feminine desires and values, and accommodate herself to masculine patterns if she is to overcome her immanence and subordination. To understand why such problems recur in The Second Sex, I turn to Sartre's Being and Nothingness. After examining the conceptions underlying his thought, I conclude that his philosophy is unable to encompass difference, and is therefore antithetical to the feminist project. 
&#182;
Foucault's philosophy offers solutions to these problems by eliminating consciousness as universal subject of action, and by making subjectivity a product of time, through showing how subjects are formed though the changing effects of power upon bodies. His thought encompasses difference at a fundamental level, through understanding human beings as particular 'events' in time. I argue that Foucault's philosophy does not depend fundamentally, as does Sartre's, upon woman as Other. 
&#182;
Foucault shows how our particular historical form of rationality, created within power relations, sets limits on what we can think, be and do. He shows how thought can overcome some of these limits, allowing us to become authors of our own actions. Misunderstandings are common, particularly of his conception of power and its relation to subjectivity. Many commentators demand changes that reinstate the concepts he fundamentally rejects. Others do not see the unity of his philosophy. I show its importance to women's emancipation and to a feminist ethics. 
&#182;
Finally, I compare Foucault's thought with feminism of difference. With the help of Heidegger, I argue that Foucault offers a superior but complementary way to know who we are, through understanding the history of our making. I show how the masculine and the feminine can be reconciled through a reconceptualisation of the relation of sex to time. All told, Foucault is a philosopher of freedom and for him the practice of freedom is an ethics.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Michel Foucault</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">freedom</field><field name="subject">anti-humanism</field><field name="subject">Spinoza</field><field name="subject">monism</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">subordination</field><field name="subject">humanist existentialism</field><field name="subject">Simone de Beauvoir</field><field name="subject">Jean-Paul Sartre</field><field name="subject">dualism</field><field name="subject">transcendence</field><field name="subject">woman</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040629.142154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respiration and nitrogen fixation by bacteroids from soybean root
nodules : substrate transport and metabolism in relation to intracellular conditions</field><field name="creator">Li, Youzhong</field><field name="description">Bacteroids of B. japonicum from nodules of soybean roots were isolated using differential centrifugation (the standard bench method) and density gradient centrifugation methods (either sucrose- or Percoll-) under anaerobic conditions in which N2 fixation was preserved. The relationships between N2 fixation and respiration, O2 supply, O2 demand, substrate (mainly malate) transport and metabolism in bacteroids were investigated using the flow chamber system. In related experiments, the primary products of N2 fixation which leave the bacteroids were investigated using a 15N-labelling technique in a closed shaken system and other biochemical methods.&#182;

In the flow chamber experiments, the rates at which O2 was supplied to bacteroids in the chamber were varied by (a) changing the flow rate of reaction medium through the chamber; (b) by changing the [O2 free] in the inflowing reaction medium by using either 3-5% (v/v) or 100% air in the gas mixture above the stirred reaction medium in two reservoir flasks; (c) by successively withdrawing bacteroids from the chamber, thus increasing the supply of O2 per bacteroid to those remaining in the chamber. The results showed that the rate of O2 supply regulates respiratory demand for O2 by bacteroids rather than the O2 concentration present in the reaction system. Respiration is always coupled to N2 fixation. &#182;  

Uptake of malate by bacteroids withdrawn from the flow chamber was measured under microaerobic conditions. Malate uptake by these N2-fixing bacteroids was lower than that by bacteroids isolated under aerobic conditions, which eliminate N2 fixation of bacteroids, but is closely correlated with bacteroid respiration rates. When respiration was increased by an increase in O2 supply, malate uptake by bacteroids was also increased. This suggested that transport of malate through the bacteroid membrane is also regulated by O2 supply, but indirectly. Higher uptake by bacteroids under aerobic conditions was observed because respiration was enhanced by the high availability of O2, but the fast uptake of malate by bacteroids driven by the abnormal respiration rates may not reflect the reality of malate demand in vivo by bacteroids when N2 fixation by bacteroids is fully coupled. &#182;

The results of 15N labelling experiments and other biochemical assays once again demonstrated that ammonia is the principal significant 15N labelled product of N2 fixation accumulated during 30 min in shaken assays with 0.008-0.01 atm O2. Alanine although sometimes found in low concentrations in the flow chamber reactions, was not labelled with 15N in shaken closed system experiments. No evidence could be obtained from the other biochemical assays, either. Therefore, it is concluded that these and earlier results were not due to contamination with host cytosolic enzymes as suggested by Waters et al. (Proc. Natl. Aca. Sci. 95, 1998, pp 12038-12042). &#182;

Malate transported into bacteroids is oxidized in a modified TCA cycle present in bacteroids. The results of flow chamber experiments with a sucA mutant (lacking a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) showed that respiratory demand for O2 by the mutant bacteroids is regulated by O2 supply in the same way as the wild-type. Despite differences in other symbiotic properties, rates of nitrogen fixation by the mutant bacteroids, based on the bacteroid dry weight, appeared to be the same as in the wild-type. Also N2 fixation was closely coupled with respiration in the same manner in both mutant bacteroids and wild type bacteroids. These results and other supporting data, strongly support the conclusion that there is an alternative pathway of the TCA cycle in bacteroids, which enables the missing step in the mutant to be by-passed with sufficient activity to support metabolism of transported malate.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">respiration</field><field name="subject">nitroge fixation</field><field name="subject">bacteroids</field><field name="subject">soybean root nodules</field><field name="subject">malate</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040630.114138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representing Time in Automated Speech Recognition</field><field name="creator">Davies, David Richard Llewellyn</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the treatment of temporal information in Automated Speech Recognition. It reviews the study of time in speech perception and concludes that while some temporal information in the speech signal is of crucial value in the speech decoding process not all temporal information is relevant to decoding.  We then review the representation of temporal information in the main automated recognition techniques: Hidden Markov Models and Artificial Neural Networks. We find that both techniques have difficulty representing the type of temporal information that is phonetically or phonologically significant in the speech signal. 

In an attempt to improve this situation we explore the problem of representation of temporal information in the acoustic vectors commonly used to encode the speech acoustic signal in the front-ends of speech recognition systems. We attempt, where possible, to let the signal provide the temporal structure rather than imposing a fixed, clock-based timing framework. We develop a novel acoustic temporal parameter (the Parameter Similarity Length), a measure of temporal stability, that is tested against the time derivatives of acoustic parameters conventionally used in acoustic vectors.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automated speech Recognition</field><field name="subject">Source Synchronous Analysis</field><field name="subject">Temporal Representation in speech</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040602.163031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telling Australia's story to the world: The Department of Information 1939-1950</field><field name="creator">Vickery, Edward Louis</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the organisation and operation of the Australian Government&#146;s Department of Information that operated from 1939 to 1950. Equal weighting is given to
the wartime and peacetime halves of the Department&#146;s existence, allowing a balanced assessment of the Department&#146;s role and development from its creation through to its
abolition. The central issue that the Department had to address was: what was an appropriate and acceptable role for a government information organisation in Australia&#146;s democratic political system? The issue was not primarily one of formal restrictions on the government&#146;s power but rather of the accepted conception of the role of government. No societal consensus had been established before the Department was thrust into dealing with this issue on a practical basis. While the application of the Department&#146;s censorship function attracted considerable comment, the procedures were clear and accepted.
Practices laid down in World War I were revived and followed, while arguments were over degree rather than kind. It was mainly in the context of its expressive functions that the
Department had to confront the fundamental issue of its role. This study shows that the development of the Department was driven less by sweeping ministerial pronouncements
than through a series of pragmatic incremental responses to circumstances as they arose.
This Departmental approach was reinforced by its organisational weakness. The Department&#146;s options in its relations with media organisations and other government agencies were, broadly, competition, compulsion and cooperation. Competition was never
widely pursued and the limits of compulsion in regard to its expressive functions were rapidly reached and withdrawn from. Particularly through to 1943 the Department struggled when it sought to assert its position against the claims of other government
agencies and commercial organisations. Notwithstanding some high profile conflicts, this study shows that the Department primarily adopted a cooperative stance, seeking to
supplement rather than supplant the work of other organisations. Following the 1943 Federal elections the Department was strengthened by stable and focused leadership as well
as the development of its own distribution channels and outlets whose audience was primarily overseas. While some elements, such as the film unit, remained reasonably
politically neutral, the Department as a whole was increasingly employed to promote the message of the Government of the day. This led to a close identification of the Department
with the Labor Party, encouraging the Department&#146;s abolition following the Coalition parties&#146; victory in the 1949 Federal elections. Nevertheless in developing its role the Department had remained within the mainstream of administrative practice in Australia.
While some of its staff assumed a greater public profile than had been the practice for prewar public servants, this was not unusual or exceptional at that time. Partly through the efforts of the Department, the accepted conception of the role of government had expanded
sufficiently by 1950 that despite the abolition of the Department most of its functions continued within the Australian public sector.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Australian history</field><field name="subject">public service</field><field name="subject">administration</field><field name="subject">propaganda</field><field name="subject">advertising</field><field name="subject">broadcasting</field><field name="subject">ABC</field><field name="subject">Radio Australia</field><field name="subject">documentary film</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">newspapers</field><field name="subject">World War II</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040721.123626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inferring the Spatial Distribution of Regolith Properties Using Surface Measurable Features</field><field name="creator">Laffan, Shawn William</field><field name="description">The aim of this research is to determine to what extent properties of the regolith may be inferred using only features easily measured from the surface. To address this research question, a set of regolith properties from Weipa, Queensland, Australia, are analysed. The set contains five variables, oxides of Aluminium, Iron, Silica and Titanium, as well as Depth to Ironstone. This last represents the depth of the layer from which the oxides are sampled.&#182;  The research question is addressed in two ways. First, locations where the properties are related to modern surface hydrology are assessed using spatially explicit analyses. This is done by comparing the results of spatial association statistics using geometric and watershed-based spatial samples. Second, correlations are sought for between the regolith properties and geomorphometric indices of land surface morphology and Landsat Thematic Mapper spectral response. This is done using spatially implicit Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and spatially explicit Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). The results indicate that the degree to which regolith properties are related to surface measurable features is limited and spatially variable.&#182; Most locations in the Weipa landscape exhibit some degree of modern hydrological control of the oxide variables at lateral distances of 120 m. This control rarely extends beyond 300 m laterally, although such locations occupy distinct positions in the landscape. Conversely, there is an extensive part of the landscape where Depth to Ironstone is under hydrological control. This occupies most of the lower elevations in the study area. Depth to Ironstone represents the depth to the redox front where iron is precipitated, but may in some parts of the landscape control the distribution of the watertable by being impermeable.&#182; For the correlation analyses, the highest correlations are found with those oxides most mobile in solution. The spatially local GWR results also consistently outperform the spatially global ANN results, commonly having accuracies 40% higher at the error tolerance used. Much of this can be attributed to the localized effects of landscape evolution. Comparison of the GWR results against the local sample mean indicate that there is a relationship between regolith properties and surface measurable features at 10-15% of sample locations for the oxide variables, and 22% for Depth to Ironstone.&#182; The implications of these results are significant for anyone intending to generate spatial datasets of regolith properties. If there is a low spatial density of sample data, then the effects of landscape evolution can reduce the utility of any analysis results. Instead, spatially dense, direct measurements of subsurface regolith properties are needed. While these may not be a direct measurement of the property of interest, they may provide useful additional information by which these may be inferred.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spatial distribution</field><field name="subject">regolith properties</field><field name="subject">surface measurable features</field><field name="subject">oxides</field><field name="subject">Weipa</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040714.155019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhetoric and Reality in the
World Bank&#146;s Relations with NGOs:
an Indonesian Case Study</field><field name="creator">Whitelum, Bernadette</field><field name="description">The World Bank is one of the most powerful institutions in the world. And it is charged with some of the world&#146;s most important goals, at least in rhetoric. The World Bank&#146;s mission is &#147;A World Free of Poverty&#148;. World Bank rhetoric now sees the institution
embrace such goals as &#145;poverty alleviation&#146;, &#145;environmental sustainability&#146;, &#145;gendermainstreaming&#146;, &#145;good governance&#146;, and &#145;partnerships for development&#146;. These claims demand critical analysis so that the reality of the Bank&#146;s agenda and work can be
deciphered from its rhetoric. To that end, this research critically examines the World Bank&#146;s rhetoric and strategies for engaging NGOs in what it describes as a &#145;partnership for development&#146;.&#182; The World Bank, in the past two decades, has been at the receiving end of an increasing critical commentary, much of which emerges from the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). In response the World Bank has started opening its doors, slowly at first, and then with increasing rigour, the Bank sought to intensify its dialogue with NGOs. Its tone is conciliatory towards NGOs, giving the appearance of an institution that is willing to learn, willing to be moved, and willing to transform itself.&#182; This thesis analyses literature and primary research gathered from fieldwork experience in Indonesia. In exploring the case study I unearth the ways in which the continuing neoliberal development agenda of the World Bank drives its NGO engagement strategies. I discuss questions such as, do dialogues with NGOs produce change to the World Bank and its development agenda, and if so then what is the nature of those changes? Might the building of relations with the World Bank cause NGOs and their agendas to be transformed whilst the Bank remains relatively unchanged? What is the gendered context of the relationship and how does this reinforce unequal relationships? The Indonesian case study provides the terrain upon which these questions will be explored. Exploring these questions makes evident what can be expected from the World Bank of its engagement with NGOs, in process and outcome. This, in turn, illuminates the agendas open for change and transformation at the Bank, the contested agendas, and the
fundamental, non-negotiable and immutable agendas. In conclusion, this thesis reflects on the possibilities for change in the future.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World Bank</field><field name="subject">rhetoric</field><field name="subject">NGOs</field><field name="subject">Non-Governmental Organisations</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">neoliberal development</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040804.140004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inference for Discrete Time Stochastic Processes using Aggregated Survey Data</field><field name="creator">Davis, Brett Andrew</field><field name="description">We consider a longitudinal system in which transitions between the states are governed by a discrete time finite state space stochastic process X. Our aim, using aggregated sample survey data of the form typically collected by official statistical agencies, is to undertake model based inference for the underlying process X. We will develop inferential techniques for continuing sample surveys of two distinct types. First, longitudinal surveys in which the same individuals are sampled in each cycle of the survey. Second, cross-sectional
surveys which sample the same population in successive cycles but with no attempt to track particular individuals from one cycle to the next. Some of the basic results have appeared in Davis et al (2001) and Davis et al (2002).&#182; Longitudinal surveys provide data in the form of transition frequencies between the states of X. In Chapter Two we develop a method for modelling and estimating the one-step transition probabilities in the case where X is a non-homogeneous Markov chain and transition frequencies are observed at unit time intervals. However, due to their expense, longitudinal surveys are typically conducted at widely, and sometimes irregularly, spaced time points. That is, the observable frequencies pertain to multi-step transitions. Continuing to assume the Markov property for X, in Chapter Three, we show that these multi-step transition frequencies can be stochastically interpolated to provide accurate estimates of the one-step transition probabilities of the underlying process. These estimates for a unit time increment can be used to calculate estimates of expected future occupation time, conditional on an individual&#146;s state at initial point of observation, in the different states of X.&#182; For reasons of cost, most statistical collections run by official agencies are cross-sectional sample surveys. The data observed from an on-going survey of this type are marginal frequencies in the states of X at a sequence of time points. In Chapter Four we develop a model based technique for estimating the marginal probabilities of X using data of this form. Note that, in contrast to the longitudinal case, the Markov assumption does not simplify inference based on marginal frequencies. The marginal probability estimates enable estimation of future occupation times (in each of the states of X) for an individual of unspecified initial state. However, in the applications of the technique that we discuss (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5) the estimated occupation times will be conditional on both gender and initial age of individuals.&#182; The longitudinal data envisaged in Chapter Two is that obtained from the surveillance of the same sample in each cycle of an on-going survey. In practice, to preserve data quality it is necessary to control respondent burden using sample rotation. This is usually achieved using a mechanism known as rotation group sampling. In Chapter Five we consider the particular form of rotation group sampling used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in their Monthly Labour Force Survey (from which official estimates of labour force participation rates are produced). We show that our approach to estimating the one-step transition probabilities of X from transition frequencies observed at incremental time intervals, developed in Chapter Two, can be modified to deal with data collected under this sample rotation scheme. Furthermore, we show that valid inference is possible even when the Markov property does not hold for the underlying process.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aggregated data</field><field name="subject">cross-sectional survey</field><field name="subject">longitudinal survey</field><field name="subject">marginal

'self' and 'other' in political interviews</field><field name="creator">Bramley, Nicolette Ruth</field><field name="description">Pronouns play a key role in the construction of &#145;self&#146; and &#145;other&#146;. They are not merely a way of expressing person, number and gender as is suggested by traditional grammarians nor do they only do referential and deictic work. Rather, they must be thought of in the context of interaction and in terms of the &#145;identity work&#146; that they accomplish. In this thesis, it is argued that pronouns are used to construct favourable images of themselves, and &#145;others&#146;.&#182; The context of this study is the Australian political media interview. In this study, the pronouns &#145;I&#146; &#145;you&#146; &#145;we&#146; and &#145;they&#146; are examined individually, then, as they occur in sequence. This investigation reveals that pronouns are used to construct politicians&#146; multiple &#145;selves&#146; and &#145;others&#146; and that as they occur in sequence, the changing &#145;selves&#146; of politicians and different &#145;others&#146; are created. The construction of these multiple &#145;selves&#146; and &#145;others&#146; is a version of reality that politicians construct discursively and is not an objective representation of facts.&#182; This analysis of pronouns in political interviews also reveals striking and hitherto unresearched uses of pronouns, which can be used to show affiliation or create distance between people where it would not traditionally be expected. Politicians actively exploit the flexibility of pronominal reference to construct the different identities of themselves and &#145;other&#146; and use them to create different alignments to, and boundaries between, their multiple &#145;selves&#146; and &#145;others&#146;. Thus, pronouns are pivotal in the construction of reality &#150; a reality that is created and understood in the discourse of the moment.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">political discourse</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="subject">pronouns</field><field name="subject">self</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040817.141350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of Silicon Solar Cells: Thin-Film Cells and LPCVD Silicon Nitride</field><field name="creator">McCann, Michelle Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses the growth of thin-film silicon layers suitable for solar cells using
liquid phase epitaxy and the behaviour of oxide LPCVD silicon nitride stacks on silicon
in a high temperature ambient.&#182;
The work on thin film cells is focussed on the characteristics of layers grown using liquid
phase epitaxy. The morphology resulting from different seeding patterns, the transfer of
dislocations to the epitaxial layer and the lifetime of layers grown using oxide compared
with carbonised photoresist barrier layers are discussed. The second half of this work
discusses boron doping of epitaxial layers. Simultaneous layer growth and boron doping
is demonstrated, and shown to produce a 35um thick layer with a back surface field
approximately 3.5um thick.&#182;
If an oxide/nitride stack is formed in the early stages of cell processing, then characteristics of the nitride may enable increased processing flexibility and hence the realisation
of novel cell structures. An oxide/nitride stack on silicon also behaves as a good anti-
reflection coating.  The effects of a nitride deposited using low pressure chemical vapour
deposition on the underlying wafer are discussed. With a thin oxide layer between the
silicon and the silicon nitride, deposition is shown not to significantly alter effective life-times.&#182;
Heating an oxide/nitride stack on silicon is shown to result in a large drop in effective
Lifetimes. As long as at least a thin oxide is present, it is shown that a high temperature
nitrogen anneal results in a reduction in surface passivation, but does not significantly
affect bulk lifetime. The reduction in surface passivation is shown to be due to a loss of
hydrogen from the silicon/silicon oxide interface and is characterised by an increase in
Joe. Higher temperatures, thinner oxides, thinner nitrides and longer anneal times are all
shown to result in high Joe values. A hydrogen loss model is introduced to explain the
observations.&#182;
Various methods of hydrogen re-introduction and hence Joe recovery are then discussed 
with an emphasis on high temperature forming gas anneals. The time necessary
for successful Joe recovery is shown to be primarily dependent on the nitride thickness
and on the temperature of the nitrogen anneal. With a high temperature forming gas
anneal, Joe recovery after nitrogen anneals at both 900 and 1000oC and with an optimised
anti-reflection coating is demonstrated for chemically polished wafers.&#182;

Finally the effects of oxide/nitride stacks and high temperature anneals in both nitrogen 
and forming gas are discussed for a variety of wafers. The optimal emitter sheet
resistance is shown to be independent of nitrogen anneal temperature. With textured
wafers, recovery of Joe values after a high temperature nitrogen anneal is demonstrated
for wafers with a thick oxide, but not for wafers with a thin oxide. This is shown to be
due to a lack of surface passivation at the silicon/oxide interface.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thin film silicon layers</field><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">liquid phase epitaxy</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">LPCVD</field><field name="subject">low pressure chemical vapour deposition</field><field name="subject">high temperature</field><field name="subject">oxide nitride stacks</field><field name="subject">silicon nitride</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040903.100315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Propagation effects in optical waveguides, fibres and devices</field><field name="creator">Tomljenovic-Hanic, Snjezana</field><field name="description">This thesis consist of a theoretical study of propagation effects in optical waveguides, fibres and photonic crystals, with some comparison with experiment.&#182;
Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction with the current view of optical components in photonic integrated circuits and issues related to the loss mechanism.&#182;
In Chapter 2 the characteristics of single-mode propagation and transient effects in practical square- and rectangular-core buried channel planar waveguides are quantified, assuming a cladding which is unbounded in one transverse dimension and bounded in the other. The wavelength cut-off condition for the fundamental mode is determined when the cladding index is asymmetric and composed of step-wise, uniform index regions.&#182;
In Chapter 3, the application of segmented reflection gratings in planar devices that can function as either a single- or two-wavelength add/drop filter is investigated and a numerical technique developed in Chapter 2 is applied to the waveguides with high extinction ratio. The role of the segmented gratings is analogous to that of a blazed grating, but they can provide a higher reflectivity level at the Bragg wavelength, eliminate back reflection into the fundamental mode and provide arbitrarily small channel spacing in the two-wavelength case.&#182;
Chapters 4 address the problem of bend loss in a single-mode slab waveguide. A new theoretical strategy for reducing bend loss is presented and compared to existing designs. The results obtained in this chapter are the basis for the following two chapters.&#182; 
Chapter 5 deals with bend loss in single-mode buried channel waveguides and demonstrates that the new strategy can lead to significant bend loss reduction when compared to other strategies, and, conversely, can be used to enhance bend loss for a fixed bend radius for application to devices such as optical attenuators.&#182; 
In Chapter 6, a novel design of a variable optical attenuator based on a bent channel waveguide is proposed, realized by applying a new strategy for bend loss control in a polymer buried channel waveguide.&#182; 
Chapter 7 investigates effects of the additional rings in a single mode step-index fibre on bend loss. It is supported with the experimental results of Ron Bailey from Optical the Fibre Technology Centre, University in Sydney.&#182; 
In Chapter 8, bend loss of a one-dimensional photonic crystal is quantified and compared to bend loss of a standard single-mode slab waveguide and a bend-resistant waveguide.&#182;</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">propagation effects</field><field name="subject">optical waveguides</field><field name="subject">fibres</field><field name="subject">devices</field><field name="subject">photonic crystals</field><field name="subject">bend loss</field><field name="subject">optical attenuators</field><field name="subject">grating</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040921.104741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The environmental implications of the local-state antinomy in Australia</field><field name="creator">Wild River, Su</field><field name="description">An antinomy is a contradiction between a principle and its opposite, where there is a
compelling case for accepting both. This thesis adopts the antinomy of local-state
government in Australia as its central conceptual theme, describing it with the following
defensible, but contradictory principles that:&#182;
&#183;	Australian local governments are statutory agencies of Australia&#146;s state
	governments, with no power or authority beyond that which is ascribed to them by
	the states (the outside-in principle); and&#182;
&#183;	Local governments in Australia are independent agencies whose authority and
interests transcend their regulatory powers by nature of their attachment to their
local area (the inside-out principle).&#182;
The central conceptual theme of the antinomy of local-state government shapes the
overall thesis, as well as providing the focus for its introduction and conclusion. The thesis
induces elements of the antinomy and structures much of its discussion around these key
issues. It does not try to prove or resolve the antinomy. Instead the thesis uses the concept to
explore and develop its second complex theme - the practical and applied experience of
Australian local governments (LGs) as they attempt to deliver beneficial environmental
outcomes. The great bulk of the substantive work presented in the thesis focuses on
descriptions and analyses of LGs&#146; environmental work and the contexts within which they
do it. The thesis contends that the local-state antinomy underpins many problems facing
Australian LGs as they attempt to deliver beneficial environmental outcomes.
Four research questions are addressed. They are:&#182;
&#183;	How can Australian LG capacity to deliver beneficial environmental outcomes be
		understood?&#182;
&#183;	Within this capacity, what are the environmental outcomes now being achieved by
		Australian LGs?&#182;
&#183;	How can Australian local government extend its capacity to deliver beneficial
		environmental outcomes? And&#182;
&#183;	What are the implications of the local-state antinomy on Australian LG capacity to
		deliver beneficial environmental outcomes?&#182;
This thesis reviews literature on Australian LG, LG environmental work, and the
methods that are appropriate in investigating these questions. The overall thesis uses
scientific, grounded theory and action research methods and draws on ideas from symbolic
interactionism. Parts of the thesis also use environmental risk assessment, gap analysis
techniques, case study and comparative analysis. The goal of generating grounded theories
led to a strong focus on the development and exploration of analytical categories and the
relationships between them. One such category summarises the relationship between LG
and state government (SG), whereby LGs are identified as the inside sphere of government,
while the SG is one of several outside spheres. Environmental efforts that impact between
the spheres are described in relation to their source and impact, using this terminology, so
that inside-out initiatives are driven by LGs but impact more broadly, and outside-in
initiatives are driven by states but impact on local areas.&#182;
Two extensive studies are presented, each stemming primarily from one side of the
local-state antinomy. The first is a quantitative, statewide study of local (and state)
government implementation of the Queensland Environmental Protection Act. That process
is considered a predominantly outside-in environmental initiative, in that LG interest and
authority for that work stem directly from a SG statute. For simplicity, this is referred to as
an outside-in study. That study involved the development and application of the
Comparative Environmental Risk Assessment Method, that enabled the assessment of the
environmental and other outcomes from the Queensland legislation.&#182;
The outside-in study is complimented by comparative case studies that mostly
reflect inside-out environmental initiatives as they are defined and described by LGs.
Again, this required the development of innovative research methods, specifically a
comparative case study method. 34 case studies gathered from different types of LGs across
Australia are presented, each representing an attempt by LG to deliver beneficial
environmental outcomes.&#182;
In answer to the research questions, LG capacity to deliver environmental outcomes
can be understood when the antinomy is examined through the research methods and
analytical categories developed and presented here. LGs are delivering significant beneficial
environmental outcomes, both as agents of SGs and through their own initiatives.
Improving LG capacity to deliver environmental outcomes primarily requires a respect for
LG perspectives, and for LG priorities, which inherently include a focus on their own local
areas. State governments can build effective partnerships between the spheres and enhance
LG environmental capacity by recognising and supporting LG&#146;s own priorities, while
assisting their engagement with broader strategic objectives.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antinomy</field><field name="subject">local-state government</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">environmental outcomes</field><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">LG</field><field name="subject">state government</field><field name="subject">SG</field><field name="subject">environmental risk assessment</field><field name="subject">comparative case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040922.142838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contested Identity: the media and independence in New Caledonia during the 1980s</field><field name="creator">Chanter, Alaine</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the discursive struggle in the New Caledonian media over the question of independence during the period of most acute conflict during the 1980s.  It seeks to demonstrate that the discursive struggle was central to the political struggle, particularly in its emphasis on the development of discourses on identity which authorised particular forms of political engagement.  Colonial discourses in New Caledonia provided a well tested armory of identifications of the territory&#146;s indigenous people which were mobilised in the anti-independence media, particularly the territory&#146;s monopoly daily newspaper Les Nouvelles Cal&#233;doniennes.  The thesis attempts to demonstrate how these identifications connoted, in effect, the non-existence of Kanaks through a denial of a &#145;Kanak&#146; identity:  Melanesians who identified themselves as Kanaks and took a pro-independence stance were not recognised within the colonial identity constructions of &#145;Caledonian&#146; and &#145;Melanesian&#146;, and their claims to constitute a &#145;people&#146; were vociferously denied.  They existed within colonial discourses as a human absence, and were therefore considered to have no rightful claim on Caledonian political life.  In the face of such identifications, the pro-independence movement articulated in its media notions of &#145;Kanakness&#146; and the &#145;Kanak people&#146; which sought to hyper-valorise their identity as human and rightful.&#182;  

It is argued that an analysis of media discourses requires consideration of the type of institutional constraints operating within the media institutions from within which these discourses emerge.  The thesis therefore analyses the major constraints operating within Les Nouvelles Cal&#233;doniennes and the two major pro-independence media organisations, &#145;Kanaky&#146;s first newspaper&#146; Bwenando and &#145;Kanaky&#146;s first radio station&#146; Radio Djiido.&#182;

As an overarching concern, the thesis attempts to work through and apply different theoretical approaches relevant to the analysis of media reporting in situations of heightened political contestation, negotiating through aspects of neo-Marxist and post-structuralist approaches.  It assesses the relevance of the notion of &#145;ideological effect&#146; as an analytical tool in assessing the effects of power produced by particular discourse, concluding that some theoretical notion concerned with elucidating the differential effects of power is required.&#182;</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">New Caledonia</field><field name="subject">Les Nouvelles Caledoniennes</field><field name="subject">loyalism</field><field name="subject">state broadcasting</field><field name="subject">metissage</field><field name="subject">independence</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">Bwenando</field><field name="subject">Radio Djiido</field><field name="subject">Kanaks</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20040923.133021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproductive success, dimorphism and sex allocation in the brown falcon Falco berigora</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Paul</field><field name="description">This project describes various aspects of the breeding ecology and behaviour of the brown falcon Falco berigora, a common but poorly study Australian raptor. In particular it examines (a) the main influences on reproductive success; (b) tests predictions of theories proposed to explain the evolution and maintenance of sexual size dimorphism (RSD; females the larger sex) in raptors; and (c) investigates sex allocation patterns in the light of current sex ratio and parental investment theory. The study was conducted between July 1999 and June 2002 approximately 35 km southwest of Melbourne, at the Western Treatment Plant (WTP), Werribee (38&#176;0&#146;S 144&#176;34&#146;E) and surrounds, a total area of approximately 150 km2.&#182;
&#183;	In all plumage and bare part colouration of 160 free-flying falcons was described. The majority of variation in these characters could be attributed to distinct age and/or sex differences as opposed to previously described colour &#145;morphs&#146;.&#182;
&#183;	Nestling chronology and development is described and formulae based on wing length derived for determining nestling age. An accurate field-based test for determining nestling sex at banding age is also presented.&#182;
&#183;	Strong sex role differentiation was apparent during breeding; typical of falcons females performed most parental duties whilst males predominantly hunted for their brood and partner. Based on observations of marked individuals, both sexes of brown falcons aggressively defended mutual territories throughout the year, with just 10% of each sex changing territories during the entire study period. Males performed territorial displays more frequently than females, the latter rarely displaying alone.&#182;
&#183;	The diet of the population as a whole was very broad, but within pairs both sexes predominantly specialised on either lagomorphs, small ground prey (e.g. house mice Mus musculus), small birds, large birds or reptiles, according to availability.&#182;
&#183;	Reproductive parameters such as clutch size and the duration of parental care were constant across all years, however marked annual differences in brood size and the proportion of pairs breeding were evident.&#182;
&#183;	Age was an important influence upon reproductive success and survival, with immature birds inferior to adults in both areas. However, interannual differences were by far the most influential factor on breeding success and female survival. Heavy rain downpours were implicated as the main determinant of reproductive success and adult female mortality in a population largely devoid of predation or human interference.&#182;
&#183;	Female-female competition for territorial vacancies was intense; larger adult females were more likely to be recruited and once breeding fledged more offspring. In contrast, male recruitment and breeding success was unrelated to either body size or condition indices, although smaller immature males were more likely to survive to the next breeding season. This directional selection is consistent only with the predictions of the intrasexual competition hypothesis.&#182;
&#183;	Despite marked RSD (males c. 75% of female body mass), throughout the nestling phase female nestlings did not require greater quantities of food than their male siblings. However, female parents fed their last-hatched sons but not daughters, resulting in the complete mortality of all last-hatched female offspring in focal nests. Given last-hatched nestlings suffered markedly reduced growth rates and female, but not male, body size is important in determining recruitment patterns, the biased allocation amongst last-hatched offspring is likely to reflect differing benefits associated with investing in small members of each sex, consistent with broad-scale Trivers-Willard effects. Recruitment patterns support this, with surviving last-hatched females, in contrast to males, unable to gain recruitment into the breeding population upon their return to the study site.&#182;
Thus selection appears to act at the nestling, immature and adult stages to maintain RSD in the focal population. Larger females were favoured in the nestling phase, at recruitment and once breeding had greater reproductive success. In contrast, selection favoured a reduction or maintenance of immature male size as smaller birds had a greater chance of survival in the year following recruitment than their larger counterparts; thereafter male size was unimportant. Together, this directional selection favouring increased female competitive ability is consistent only with the predictions of the intrasexual competition hypothesis, which appears the most probable in explaining the maintenance and perhaps evolution of RSD in raptors.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brown falcon</field><field name="subject">reproductive success</field><field name="subject">reversed sexual size dimorphism</field><field name="subject">sex allocation</field><field name="subject">falco</field><field name="subject">growth rates</field><field name="subject">kestrel</field><field name="subject">body size</field><field name="subject">costs of reproduction</field><field name="subject">fitness</field><field name="subject">life history</field><field name="subject">parental quality</field><field name="subject">prey size</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20041111.100436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A solar concentrating photovoltaic/thermal collector</field><field name="creator">Coventry, Joseph Sydney</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses aspects of a novel solar concentrating photovoltaic / thermal (PV/T) collector that has been designed to produce both electricity and hot water.  The motivation for the development of the Combined Heat and Power Solar (CHAPS) collector is twofold: in the short term, to produce photovoltaic power and solar hot water at a cost which is competitive with other renewable energy technologies, and in the longer term, at a cost which is lower than possible with current technologies.  To the author&#146;s knowledge, the CHAPS collector is the first PV/T system using a reflective linear concentrator with a concentration ratio in the range 20-40x.  The work contained in this thesis is a thorough study of all facets of the CHAPS collector, through a combination of theoretical and experimental investigation. 

A theoretical discussion of the concept of &#145;energy value&#146; is presented, with the aim of developing methodologies that could be used in optimisation studies to compare the value of electrical and thermal energy.  Three approaches are discussed; thermodynamic methods, using second law concepts of energy usefulness; economic valuation of the hot water and electricity through levelised energy costs; and environmental valuation, based on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the generation of hot water and electricity.  It is proposed that the value of electrical energy and thermal energy is best compared using a simple ratio.

Experimental measurement of the thermal and electrical efficiency of a CHAPS receiver was carried out for a range of operating temperatures and fluid flow rates.   The effectiveness of internal fins incorporated to augment heat transfer was examined.  The glass surface temperature was measured using an infrared camera, to assist in the calculation of thermal losses, and to help determine the extent of radiation absorbed in the cover materials.  FEA analysis, using the software package Strand7, examines the conductive heat transfer within the receiver body to obtain a temperature profile under operating conditions. 

Electrical efficiency is not only affected by temperature, but by non-uniformities in the radiation flux profile.  Highly non-uniform illumination across the cells was found to reduce the efficiency by about 10% relative.  The radiation flux profile longitudinal to the receivers was measured by a custom-built flux scanning device.  The results show significant fluctuations in the flux profile and, at worst, the minimum flux intensity is as much as 27% lower than the median.  A single cell with low flux intensity limits the current and performance of all cells in series, causing a significant drop in overall output.  Therefore, a detailed understanding of the causes of flux non-uniformities is essential for the design of a single-axis tracking PV trough concentrator.  Simulation of the flux profile was carried out using the ray tracing software Opticad, and good agreement was achieved between the simulated and measured results.  The ray tracing allows the effect of the receiver supports, the gap between mirrors and the mirror shape imperfections to be examined individually.  

A detailed analytical model simulating the CHAPS collector was developed in the TRNSYS simulation environment.  The accuracy of the new component was tested against measured data, with acceptable results.  A system model was created to demonstrate how sub components of the collector, such as the insulation thickness and the conductivity of the tape bonding the cells to the receiver, can be examined as part of a long term simulation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">solar thermal concentrator</field><field name="subject">pv concentrator</field><field name="subject">pvt</field><field name="subject">CHAPS</field><field name="subject">PV/thermal</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20041019.152046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Q-Learning for Robot Control</field><field name="creator">Gaskett, Chris</field><field name="description">Q-Learning is a method for solving reinforcement learning problems. Reinforcement learning problems require improvement of behaviour based on received rewards. Q-Learning has the potential to reduce robot programming effort and increase the range of robot abilities. However, most currentQ-learning systems are not suitable for robotics problems: they treat continuous variables, for example speeds or positions, as discretised values. Discretisation does not allow smooth control and does not fully exploit sensed information. A practical algorithm must also cope with real-time constraints, sensing and actuation delays, and incorrect sensor data.

This research describes an algorithm that deals with continuous state and action variables without discretising. The algorithm is evaluated with vision-based mobile robot and active head gaze control tasks. As well as learning the basic control tasks, the algorithm learns to compensate for delays in sensing and actuation by predicting the behaviour of its environment. Although the learned dynamic model is implicit in the controller, it is possible to extract some aspects of the model. The extracted models are compared to theoretically derived models of environment behaviour.

The difficulty of working with robots motivates development of methods that reduce experimentation time. This research exploits Q-learning&#146;s ability to learn by passively observing the robot&#146;s actions&#151;rather than necessarily controlling the robot. This is a valuable tool for shortening the duration of learning experiments.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">robotics</field><field name="subject">reinforcement learning</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20041108.192425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dependence of substrate-water binding on protein and inorganic cofactors of photosystem II</field><field name="creator">Hendry, Garth S.</field><field name="description">The photosynthetic water oxidation reaction is catalyzed by an inorganic Mn4OxCaClyHCO3-z cluster at the heart of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) in photosystem II.  In the absence of an atomic resolution crystal structure, the precise molecular organization of the OEC remains unresolved.  Accordingly, the role of the protein and inorganic cofactors of PSII (Ca2+, HCO3- and Cl-) in the mechanism of O2-evolution await clarification.  In this study, rapid 18O-isotope exchange measurements were applied to monitor the substrate-water binding kinetics as a function of the intermediate S-states of the catalytic site (i.e. S3, S2 and S1) in Triton X-100 solubilized membrane preparations that are enriched in photosystem II activity and are routinely used to evaluate cofactor requirements.  Consistent with the previous determinations of the 18O exchange behavior in thylakoids, the initial 18O exchange measurements of native PSII membranes at m/e = 34 (which is sensitive to the 16O18O product) show that the &#145;fast&#146; and &#145;slowly&#146; exchanging substrate-waters are bound to the catalytic site in the S3 state, immediately prior to O2 release.  Although the slowly exchanging water is bound throughout the entire S-state cycle, the kinetics of the fast exchanging water remains too fast in the S2, S1 [and S0] states to be resolved using the current instrumentation, and left open the possibility that the second substrate-water only binds to the active site after the formation of the S3 state.  Presented is the first direct evidence to show that fast exchanging water is already bound to the OEC in the S2 state.  Rapid 18O-isotope exchange measurements for Ex-depleted PSII (depleted of the 17- and 23-kDa extrinsic proteins) in the S2 state reveals a resolvable fast kinetic component of 34k2 = 120 &#177; 14 s-1.  The slowing down of the fast phase kinetics is discussed in terms of increased water permeation and the effect on the local dielectric following removal of the extrinsic subunits.  In addition, the first direct evidence to show the involvement of calcium in substrate-water binding is also presented.  Strontium replacement of the OEC Ca2+-site reveals a factor of ~3-4 increase in the 18O exchange of the slowly exchanging water across the S3, S2 and S1 states while the kinetics of the fast exchanging water remain unchanged.  Finally, a re-investigation of the proposed role for bicarbonate as an oxidizable electron donor to photosystem II was unable to discern any 18O enrichment of the photosynthetically evolved O2 in the presence of 18O-bicarbonate.  A working model for O2-evolution in terms of these results is presented.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">photosystem II</field><field name="subject">oxygen evolving complex</field><field name="subject">substrate exchange kinetics</field><field name="subject">18-O isotope exchange</field><field name="subject">mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">extrinsic proteins</field><field name="subject">calcium cofactor</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20041124.140348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the flow experiences of Web users</field><field name="creator">Pace, Steven</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a grounded theory of the flow experiences of Web users engaged in information-seeking activities. The term flow refers to a state of consciousness that is sometimes experienced by individuals who are deeply involved in an enjoyable activity. The experience is characterised by some common elements: a balance between the challenges of an activity and the skills required to meet those challenges; clear goals and feedback; concentration on the task at hand; a sense of control; a merging of action and awareness; a loss of self-consciousness; a distorted sense of time; and the autotelic experience.&#182; Researchers have recently proposed Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory as a useful framework for understanding the enjoyment experienced by Web users, but they have struggled to operationalise key constructs such as flow and challenge in their quantitative models. This study aimed to address that problem by providing a better understanding of the nature of flow as experienced by Web users engaged in information-seeking activities. The theory that was developed during this study encompasses the following topics:&#182; 

- the role that curiosity and time urgency play in the formation of a Web user's information-seeking goals and subsequent navigation behaviour;&#182; 

- the challenges that Web users face when seeking information, the skills they use in meeting those challenges, and the relationship that exists between challenges and skills;&#182; 

- the important role that focused attention plays in the flow experiences of Web users, elements that help to focus a user's attention, and elements that are distracting; and&#182; 

- various dimensions of the flow experiences of Web users, which include a joy of discovery, a reduced awareness of factors that are irrelevant to the task at hand, a distorted sense of time, a merging of action and awareness, a sense of control, mental alertness, and telepresence.&#182; 


The grounded theory research method that was employed in this study is a primarily inductive investigative process in which the researcher formulates a theory about a phenomenon by systematically gathering and analysing relevant data. The purpose of this research method is building theory, not testing theory. The data that was gathered for this study primarily consisted of semi-structured in-depth interviews with informants of varying gender, age, educational attainments, occupations and Web experience who could recall experiencing flow while using the Web.&#182; 

An important distinction between this study and other investigations into the flow experiences of Web users is the way it goes beyond sheer associations to propose explanations for how and why certain events occur - explanations that are grounded in the data rather than deduced from the literature. This study is the first of its type on this subject, and as such, it provides a useful counterpoint to previous quantitative studies.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">enjoyment</field><field name="subject">affect</field><field name="subject">attention</field><field name="subject">World Wide Web</field><field name="subject">information-seeking</field><field name="subject">grounded theory</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">interpretive</field><field name="subject">multimedia</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">information systems</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20041208.134847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transmission problems for Dirac's and Maxwell's equations with Lipschitz interfaces</field><field name="creator">Axelsson, Andreas</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to give a mathematical framework for scattering of electromagnetic waves by rough surfaces. We prove that the Maxwell transmission problem with a weakly Lipschitz interface,in finite energy norms, is well posed in Fredholm sense for real frequencies. Furthermore, we give precise conditions on the material constants &#949;, &#956; and &#963; and the frequency &#969; when this transmission problem is well posed. To solve the Maxwell transmission problem, we embed Maxwell&#146;s equations in an elliptic Dirac equation. We develop a new boundary integral method to solve the Dirac transmission problem. This method uses a boundary integral operator, the rotation operator, which factorises the double layer potential operator. We prove spectral estimates for this rotation operator in finite energy norms using Hodge decompositions on weakly Lipschitz domains. To ensure that solutions to the Dirac transmission problem indeed solve Maxwell&#146;s equations, we introduce an exterior/interior derivative operator acting in the trace space. By showing that this operator commutes with the two basic reflection operators, we are able to prove that the Maxwell transmission problem is well posed. We also prove well-posedness for a class of oblique Dirac transmission problems with a strongly Lipschitz interface, in the L_2 space on the interface.

mechanism is still not fully understood, despite considerable investigation. Since the
migration of a &#946;-trifluoroacetoxy group generally proceeds more rapidly and with more varied regiochemistry than its less electronegative counterparts, this reaction was studied
in the hope of understanding more about the subtleties of the mechanism of the &#946;- acyloxyalkyl radical rearrangement. The mechanism of the catalysed rearrangement of Nalkoxy-
2(1H)-pyridinethiones was also explored because preliminary studies indicated that the transition state (TS) for this process was isoelectronic with TSs postulated for the &#946;-acyloxyalkyl radical and other novel rearrangements.
&#182;
A kinetic study of the rearrangement of the 2-methyl-2-trifluoroacetoxy-1-heptyl
radical in solvents of different polarity was undertaken using a radical clock method. Arrhenius equations for the rearrangement in each solvent were: hexane, log10[kr (s-1)] =
11.8&#177;0.3 &#8211; (48.9&#177;0.7)/ &#952;; benzene, log10[kr (s-1)] = 12.0&#177;0.2 &#8211; (43.7&#177;0.8)/ &#952;; and
propionitrile, log10[kr (s-1)] = 11.9&#177;0.2 &#8211; (42.0&#177;0.3)/ &#952;. Rate constants at 75&#730;C were:
hexane, kr = 2.9 &#215; 104; benzene, kr = 2.8 &#215; 105; and propionitrile, kr = 4.0 &#215; 105 s-1.
The equilibrium constant for the reversible rearrangement at 80&#176;C in benzene was 15.1 &lt;K &lt; 52.9.
&#182;
A regiochemical study with oxygen-labelled radicals revealed that trifluoroacetoxy
group migration occurs with 66-83% label transposition (3,2 shift). The proportion of
3,2 shift is decreased by polar solvent, high temperature and low concentration of the
reducing agent. Results of labelling experiments were consistent with cooperative 1,2
and 3,2 shifts, the former having Ea 9.5 kJmol-1 higher than the latter in benzene
solution.
&#182;
An esr study of nine &#946;-oxygenated radicals revealed that the temperaturedependent
equilibrium conformation is controlled by a balance between steric and
stereoelectronic effects. The influence of the latter is increased by electron-attracting &#946;-
substituents. Barriers to C &#945;&#8211;C &#946; rotation in &#946;-oxyethyl radicals are approximately the same as for the propyl radical. Consequently, there is no significant through-space
interaction between the &#946;-substituent and the unpaired electron.
&#182;
Experimental results were consistent with a mechanism involving a combination
of polarized 1,2 and 3,2 concerted shifts. The results may also be rationalised by the
intermediacy of a contact ion pair, as well as combinations of the three options.

The rearrangement of N-alkoxy-2(1H)-pyridinethiones is catalysed by oxidants,
Lewis acids and protic acids. Pseudo first order kinetics are observed and there are
moderate solvent effects. The migration of a 1,1-dideuteroallyl group occurs almost
exclusively in a 1,4 sense. Migration of an enantiomerically enriched 1-phenylethyl
group proceeds with predominant retention of configuration in chloroform, but with
virtual racemisation in acetonitrile. Migrating groups do not become diffusively free
during the rearrangement. Substituents which stablise positive charge at C1 migrate more
rapidly. The bulk of evidence indicates that a catalyst activates the pyridinethione for
rearrangement by promoting aromatisation. Mass-spectrometric analysis of an isolated
intermediate and kinetic results are consistent with an intermolecular mechanism.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mechanism</field><field name="subject">rearrangement</field><field name="subject">activated</field><field name="subject">organic</field><field name="subject">radical</field><field name="subject">&#946;-acyloxyalkyl</field><field name="subject">kinetics</field><field name="subject">labelling</field><field name="subject">esr</field><field name="subject">pyridinethione</field><field name="subject">N-alkoxy-2(1H)-pyridinethione</field><field name="subject">2-(alkylsulfanyl)pyridine N-oxide</field><field name="subject">radical ion pair</field><field name="subject">tin hydride</field><field name="subject">tributylstannane</field><field name="subject">conformation</field><field name="subject">trifluoroacetate</field><field name="subject">electronic effects</field><field name="subject">17-O nmr</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20031210.143110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On multipath spatial diversity in wireless multiuser communications</field><field name="creator">Jones, Haley M.</field><field name="description">The study of the spatial aspects of multipath in wireless communications environments
is an increasingly important addition to the study of the temporal aspects
in the search for ways to increase the utilization of the available wireless channel
capacity. Traditionally, multipath has been viewed as an encumbrance in wireless
communications, two of the major impairments being signal fading and intersymbol
interference. However, recently the potential advantages of the diversity offered by
multipath rich environments in multiuser communications have been recognised.
Space time coding, for example, is a recent technique which relies on a rich scattering
environment to create many practically uncorrelated signal transmission
channels. Most often, statistical models have been used to describe the multipath
environments in such applications. This approach has met with reasonable success
but is limited when the statistical nature of a field is not easily determined or is
not readily described by a known distribution.&#182; 
Our primary aim in this thesis is to probe further into the nature of multipath
environments in order to gain a greater understanding of their characteristics and
diversity potential. We highlight the shortcomings of beamforming in a multipath
multiuser access environment. We show that the ability of a beamformer to resolve
two or more signals in angle directly limits its achievable capacity.&#182;
We test the probity of multipath as a source of spatial diversity, the limiting
case of which is co-located users. We introduce the concept of separability to define
the fundamental limits of a receiver to extract the signal of a desired user from
interfering users&#146; signals and noise. We consider the separability performances of
the minimum mean square error (MMSE), decorrelating (DEC) and matched filter
(MF) detectors as we bring the positions of a desired and an interfering user closer
together. We show that both the MMSE and DEC detectors are able to achieve
acceptable levels of separability with the users as close as &#955;/10.&#182; 
In seeking a better understanding of the nature of multipath fields themselves,
we take two approaches. In the first we take a path oriented approach. The
effects on the variation of the field power of the relative values of parameters such
as amplitude and propagation direction are considered for a two path field. The
results are applied to a theoretical analysis of the behaviour of linear detectors
in multipath fields. This approach is insightful for fields with small numbers of
multipaths, but quickly becomes mathematically complex.&#182; 
In a more general approach, we take a field oriented view, seeking to quantify
the complexity of arbitrary fields. We find that a multipath field has an intrinsic
dimensionality of (&#960;e)R/&#955;&#8776;8.54R/&#955;, for a field in a two dimensional circular region, increasing only linearly with the radius R of the region. This result implies that there is no such thing as an arbitrarily complicated multipath field. That is, a field generated by any number of nearfield and farfield, specular and diffuse
multipath reflections is no more complicated than a field generated by a limited
number of plane waves. As such, there are limits on how rich multipath can
be. This result has significant implications including means: i) to determine a
parsimonious parameterization for arbitrary multipath fields and ii) of synthesizing
arbitrary multipath fields with arbitrarily located nearfield or farfield, spatially
discrete or continuous sources. The theoretical results are corroborated by examples
of multipath field analysis and synthesis.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spatial diversity</field><field name="subject">multipath environment</field><field name="subject">wireless communication</field><field name="subject">multiuser communication</field><field name="subject">signals</field><field name="subject">MMSE</field><field name="subject">minimum mean square error</field><field name="subject">DEC</field><field name="subject">decorrelating</field><field name="subject">MF</field><field name="subject">matched filter detectors.</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050202.152811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mixed-species plantations of nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing trees</field><field name="creator">Forrester, David Ian</field><field name="description">Mixed-species plantations of eucalypts and acacias have the potential to improve stand productivity over that of respective monocultures through the facilitative effect of nitrogen-fixation by acacias, and increased resource capture through above- and belowground stratification. However, growth in mixed-species plantations may not be improved compared to that of monocultures when competitive interactions outweigh the effects of improved nutrient availability and resource capture. Careful selection of sites and species is therefore critical to successfully improving stand productivity using mixed-species plantations. This study set out to examine some of the processes and interactions that occur in mixed-species plantations, and the effect nutrient and water availability can have on the growth of mixtures.

In three out of four mixed-species field trials examined in this study, growth was not increased in mixtures compared to monocultures. However, in the fourth field trial, heights, diameters, stand volume and aboveground biomass were higher in mixtures of E. globulus and A. mearnsii from 3-4 years after planting. 

The range in outcomes from mixing species in these four trials shows that a fundamental understanding of the underlying processes is required to enable a greater predictive capacity for the circumstances under which mixtures will be successful. Therefore the growth dynamics, processes and interactions were examined in the mixtures of E. globulus and A. mearnsii. The difference in productivity between mixtures and monocultures in this trial increased with time up to age 11 years, when 1:1 mixtures contained twice the aboveground biomass of E. globulus monocultures. The positive growth response of trees in mixture compared to monocultures was the result of accelerated rates of nutrient cycling, a shift in C allocation and reductions in light competition through canopy stratification.

Nitrogen contents of foliage and soil clearly showed that A. mearnsii influenced the N dynamics in this trial. If these changes in N contents were due to N fixation by A. mearnsii, then about 51 and 86 kg N ha-1 yr-1 was fixed in the 1:1 mixtures and A. mearnsii monocultures, respectively. Nitrogen fixation was also examined using the natural abundance method. The delta15N values of foliage collected at 10 years were grouped according to the mycorrhizal status of the host plant. Therefore the discrimination of 15N during transfer from mycorrhizae to the host plant appeared to vary with mycorrhizal status, and the natural abundance of 15N was not used to quantify N fixation. 

Rates of N and P cycling in litterfall were significantly higher in stands containing at least 25% A. mearnsii (more than 31 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and more than 0.68 kg P ha-1 yr-1) compared to E. globulus monocultures (24 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and 0.45 kg P ha-1 yr-1). Rates of litter decomposition and N and P release were about twice as high in 1:1 mixtures compared to E. globulus monocultures and were even higher in A. mearnsii monocultures. It is therefore important to select N-fixing species that are capable of cycling nutrients quickly between the plant and soil, and that have readily decomposable litter.

The total belowground C allocation was not significantly different between mixtures and monocultures (14 to 16 Mg C ha-1 yr-1). However, since aboveground net primary production was greater in 1:1 mixtures, the changes in nutrient availability appears to have increased total productivity (both above- and belowground), and reduced the proportion of C allocated belowground in mixtures compared to E. globulus monocultures.

In a pot trial containing mixtures of E. globulus and A. mearnsii both species grew larger in mixture than in monoculture at low N levels, and mixtures were more productive than monocultures. However, at high N levels, E. globulus suppressed A. mearnsii and mixtures were less productive than E. globulus monocultures. Similar effects were found for high and low levels of P.

Therefore resource availability can have a strong influence on the interactions and growth of mixtures. The productivity of mixtures may only be increased on sites where the resource for which competition is reduced in mixture is a major limiting growth resource. For example, if N is not a limiting growth factor then an increase in N availability from N-fixation may not increase growth, and the N-fixing species may compete for other resources such as soil P, moisture or light.

This study has shown that mixtures containing a N-fixing trees and a non-N-fixing trees can be more productive than monocultures, but that this increase in productivity will only occur on certain sites. Examination of the growth, interactions and processes that occurred in mixtures in this study provide useful information that can aid the selection of species combinations and sites.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus globulus</field><field name="subject">Acacia mearnsii</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus nitens</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus saligna</field><field name="subject">Pinus radiata</field><field name="subject">mixed species plantation</field><field name="subject">nutrient cycling</field><field name="subject">nitrogen fixation</field><field name="subject">growth dynamics</field><field name="subject">carbon allocation</field><field name="subject">facilitation</field><field name="subject">competition</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050202.164252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Singularity theorems and the abstract boundary construction</field><field name="creator">Ashley, Michael John Siew Leung</field><field name="description">The abstract boundary construction of Scott and Szekeres has proven a practical
classification scheme for boundary points of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. It
has also proved its utility in problems associated with the re-embedding of exact
solutions containing directional singularities in space-time. Moreover it provides
a model for singularities in space-time - essential singularities. However the literature
has been devoid of abstract boundary results which have results of direct
physical applicability.&#182; 
This thesis presents several theorems on the existence of essential singularities
in space-time and on how the abstract boundary allows definition of optimal em-
beddings for depicting space-time. Firstly, a review of other boundary constructions
for space-time is made with particular emphasis on the deficiencies they possess for
describing singularities. The abstract boundary construction is then pedagogically
defined and an overview of previous research provided.&#182; 
We prove that strongly causal, maximally extended space-times possess essential
singularities if and only if they possess incomplete causal geodesics. This result
creates a link between the Hawking-Penrose incompleteness theorems and the existence of essential singularities. Using this result again together with the work of
Beem on the stability of geodesic incompleteness it is possible to prove the stability
of existence for essential singularities.&#182; 
Invariant topological contact properties of abstract boundary points are presented
for the first time and used to define partial cross sections, which are an
generalization of the notion of embedding for boundary points. Partial cross sections
are then used to define a model for an optimal embedding of space-time.&#182; 
Finally we end with a presentation of the current research into the relationship
between curvature singularities and the abstract boundary. This work proposes
that the abstract boundary may provide the correct framework to prove curvature
singularity theorems for General Relativity. This exciting development would culminate over 30 years of research into the physical conditions required for curvature singularities in space-time.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">essential singularities</field><field name="subject">space-time</field><field name="subject">optimal embeddings</field><field name="subject">Beem</field><field name="subject">curvature singularities</field><field name="subject">abstract boundary</field><field name="subject">theorems</field><field name="subject">General Relativity</field><field name="subject">a-boundary</field><field name="subject">Riemannian manifolds</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050209.165310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">China's far below replacement level fertility: a reality or illusion arising from underreporting of births?</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Guangyu</field><field name="description">How fast and how far China&#146;s fertility declined in the 1990s has long been a matter
of considerable debate, despite very low fertility consistently being reported in a
number of statistical investigations over time. Most demographers interpreted this as
a result of serious underreporting of births in population statistics, due to the family
planning program, especially the program strengthening after 1991. Consequently,
they suggested that fertility fell only moderately below-replacement level, around 1.8
children per woman from the early 1990s. But some demographers argued that
surveys and census may have reflected a real decline of fertility even allowing for
some underreporting of births, given the consistency between data sources and over
time. They believed that fertility declined substantially in the 1990s, very likely in
the range between 1.5 and 1.6 by the year 2000.&#182;
The controversy over fertility is primarily related to the problem of underreporting of
births, in particular the different estimations of the extent of underreporting.
However, a correct interpretation of fertility data goes far beyond the pure numbers,
which calls for a thorough understanding of different data sources, the programmatic
and societal changes that occurred in the 1990s, and their effects on both fertility
changes and data collection efforts. This thesis aims to address the question whether
the reported far-below-replacement level fertility was a reality of substantial fertility
decline or just an illusion arising from underreporting of births. Given the nature of
the controversy, it devotes most efforts in assessing data quality, through examining
the patterns, causes and extent of underreporting of births in each data source;
reconstructing the decline of fertility in the 1990s; and searching corroborating
evidence for the decline.&#182;
After reviewing programmatic changes in the 1990s, this thesis suggests that the
program efforts were greatly strengthened, which would help to bring fertility down,
but the birth control policy and program target were not tightened as generally
believed. The program does affect individual reporting of births, but the
completeness of births in each data source is greatly dependent on who collects
fertility data and how the data are collected. The thesis then carefully examines the
data collection operations and underreporting of births in five sets of fertility data:
the hukou statistics, the family planning statistics, population census, annual survey
and retrospective survey. The analysis does not find convincing evidence that
fertility data deteriorated more seriously in the 1990s than the preceding decade.
Rather, it finds that surveys and censuses have a far more complete reporting of
births than the registration-based statistics, because they directly obtain information
from respondents, largely avoiding intermediate interference from local program
workers. In addition, the detailed examination suggests that less than 10 percent
births may have been unreported in surveys and censuses. The annual surveys, which
included many higher-order our-of-plan births being misreported as first-order births,
have more complete reporting of births than censuses, which were affected by the
increasing population mobility and field enumeration difficulties, and retrospective
surveys, which suffered from underreporting of higher-order births.&#182;
Using the unadjusted data of annual surveys from 1991 to 1999, 1995 sample census
and 2000 census, this research shows that fertility first dropped from 2.3 to 1.7 in the
first half of the 1990s, and further declined to a lower level around 1.5-1.6 in the
second half of the decade. The comparison with other independent sources
corroborates the reliability of this estimation. Putting China&#146;s fertility decline in
international perspective, comparison with the experiences of Thailand and Korea
also supports such a rapid decline. Subsequently, the thesis reveals an increasingly
narrow gap between state demands and popular fertility preferences, and great
contributions from delayed marriage and nearly universal contraception. It is
concluded that the fertility declined substantially over the course of the 1990s and
dropped to a very low level by the end of last century. It is very likely that the
combination of a government-enforced birth control program and rapid societal
changes quickly moved China into the group of very low-fertility countries earlier
than that might have been anticipated, as almost all the others are developed
countries.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">below-replacement fertility</field><field name="subject">underreporting of births</field><field name="subject">data quality</field><field name="subject">population statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050224.092945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water First : a political history of hydraulics in Vietnam's Red River Delta</field><field name="creator">Smith, S.

much land be abandoned under a collectivised agriculture system? And what role
did poor water control infrastructure play in creating such a situation?&#182;
I answer these questions by examining the historical patterns of hydraulic
development in northern Vietnam from the beginning of the 19th century until the
introduction of the Production Contract system in 1981. Underlying both the
French colonial and communist visions of modernity and economic development
was a belief that improving agricultural productivity, of which large-scale hydraulic
infrastructure was an important component, could catalyse growth in the rural
economy, which could then finance industrialisation. I argue throughout this thesis
that developing large-scale hydraulic infrastructure in the Red River delta has relied
upon the creation of a hydraulic bargain between the state and water users. This is
in contrast to Wittfogel's theory of the hydraulic state, insofar as developing
hydraulic infrastructure has depended upon the active political and economic
participation and support of water users, and not the absolute power of the state.
The political economic history of the hydraulic bargain highlights the relative
power of peasants to influence the direction of large-scale hydraulic development
and, as such, the shape of the Red River delta's wet-rice economy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydraulic infrastructure</field><field name="subject">Red River delta</field><field name="subject">H&#228;i Hung province</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">water control</field><field name="subject">wet-rice economy</field><field name="subject">hydraulic bargain</field><field name="subject">irrigation</field><field name="subject">hydraulic management</field><field name="subject">collectivised agriculture</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050314.135921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construals of Human Rights Law: Protecting Subgroups As Well As Individual Humans</field><field name="creator">Nolan, Mark Andrew</field><field name="description">This research develops the social psychological study of lay perception of human rights and of rights-based reactions to perceived injustice.  The pioneering work by social representation theorists is reviewed.  Of particular interest is the use of rights-based responses to perceived relative subgroup disadvantage.  It is argued that these responses are shaped by the historical development of the legal concept of unique subgroup rights; rights asserted by a subgroup that cannot be asserted by outgroup members or by members of a broader collective that includes all subgroups.

The assertion of unique subgroup rights in contrast to individual rights was studied by presenting participants with scenarios suggestive of human rights violations.  These included possible violations of privacy rights of indigenous Australians (Study 1), civil and political rights of indigenous Australians under mandatory sentencing schemes (Study 2), privacy rights of students in comparison to public servants (Study 3), refugee rights (Study 4), and reproductive rights of lesbians and single women in comparison to married women and women in de facto relationships (Study 5).  The scenarios were based on real policy issues being debated in Australia at the time of data collection.  Human rights activists participated in Studies 4 and 5.  In Study 5, these activists participated via an online, web-based experiment.  Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected.

A social identity theory perspective is used drawing on concepts from both social identity theory and self-categorization theory.  The studies reveal a preference for an equality-driven construal of the purpose of human rights law (i.e. that all Australians be treated equally regardless of subgroup membership) in contrast to minority support for a vulnerable groups construal of the purpose of human rights (i.e. that the purpose of human rights law is to protect vulnerable subgroups within a broader collective).

Tajfelian social belief orientations of social mobility and social change are explicitly measured in Studies 3-5.  Consistent with the social identity perspective, these ideological beliefs are conceptualised as background knowledge relevant to the subjective structuring of social reality (violation contexts) and to the process of motivated relative perception from the vantage point of the perceiver.  There is some indication from these studies that social belief orientation may determine construals of the purpose of human rights.  In Study 5 the observed preference for using inclusive human rights rhetoric in response to perceived subgroup injustice is explained as an identity-management strategy of social creativity.  In Studies 4 and 5, explicit measurement of activist identification was also made in an attempt to further explain the apparently-dominant preference for an equality-driven construal of the purpose of human rights law and the preferred use of inclusive, individualised rights rhetoric in response to perceived subgroup injustice.

Activist identification explained some action preferences, but did not simply translate into preferences for using subgroup interest arguments.  In Study 5, metastereotyping measures revealed that inclusive rights-based protest strategies were used in order to create positive impressions of social justice campaigners in the minds of both outgroup and ingroup audiences.

A normal, dynamic isoform of prion protein (PrP^C) transforms into a pathogenic, compact isoform (PrP^Sc) during prion disease pathogenesis. The PrP^Sc, acting as a template upon which PrP^C molecules are refolded into a likeness of itself, accumulates in the brain neurones and causes disease. It is the only known component of prions, proteinaceous infectious particles. Both prion protein isoforms have the same primary amino acid structure and are encoded by the same prion protein gene (PRNP). PRNP determines susceptibility/disposition to prion diseases and their phenotypes.&#182;The normal function of PRNP is elusive. The Prnp knock-out mice with disrupted ORF show only very subtle phenotype. A number of hypotheses were proposed on the function of mammalian PRNP. The extracellular, GPI-anchored, glycosylated mammalian PrP^C expressed in a heterogenous set of cells could: transport copper from extracellular to intracellular milieu, buffer copper from synapse, contribute to redox signalling, act neuroprotectively, mediate cell-cell contacts, affect lymphocyte activation, participate in nucleic acid metabolism, be a memory molecule, and be a signal-transduction protein.&#182; Experimental evidence demonstrated a redundancy between the PRNP and another, unknown gene. The critical issue therefore is to discover new genes homologous with PRNP, candidates for this redundancy. Using unpublished data, a sequence of zebrafish cDNA sequenced by Prof. Tatjana Simonic&#146;s group (University of Milan, Italy), I discovered a new paralogue of PRNP. By searching manually, and in a targeted fashion, data deposited in public biological databases, I compiled support for the new human gene Shadow of prion protein (SPRN) including the direct evidence, homology-based evidence and ab initio gene prediction. The protein product called Shadoo (shadow in Japanese) is an extracellular, potentially glycosylated and GPI-anchored protein of a mature size of 100-odd amino acids. It is conserved from fish (zebrafish, Fugu, Tetraodon) to mammals (human, mouse, rat), and exhibits similarity of overall protein features with PrP. Most remarkably, the Sho is the first human/mammalian protein apart from PrP that contains the middle hydrophobic region that is essential for both normal and pathogenic properties of PrP. As this region is critical for heterodimerization of PrP, Sho may have potential to interact with PrP and is a likely candidate for the Protein X. Mammalian SPRN could be predominantly expressed in brain (Tatjana Simonic Lab, University of Milan, Italy).&#182; Using the same approach to search public databases, I found, in addition, a fish duplicate of SPRN called SPRNB, and defined a new vertebrate SPRN gene family. Further, I also expanded a number of known fish genes from the PRNP gene family. The total number of the new genes that I discovered is 11. With the representatives of two vertebrate gene family datasets in hand, I conducted comparative genomic analysis in order to determine evolutionary trajectories of the SPRN and PRNP genes. This analysis, complemented with phylogenetic studies (Dr. Lars Jermiin, University of Sydney, Australia), demonstrated conservative evolution of the mammalian SPRN gene, and more relaxed evolutionary constraints acting on the mammalian PRNP gene. This evolutionary dialectic challenges widely adopted view on the &#147;highly conserved vertebrate&#148; PRNP and indicates that the SPRN gene may have more prominent function. More conserved Sprn could therefore substitute for the loss of less conserved, dispensable Prnp in the Prnp knock-out mice. Furthermore, the pathogenic potential of PRNP may be a consequence of relaxed evolutionary constraints.&#182; Depth of comparative genomic analysis, strategy to understand biological function, depends on the number of species in comparison and their relative evolutionary distance. To understand better evolution and function of mammalian PRNP, I isolated and characterized the PRNP gene from Australian model marsupial tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii). Marsupials are mammals separated from their eutherian relatives by roughly 180 million years. Comparison of the tammar wallaby and Brazilian opossum PrP with other vertebrate PrPs indicated patterns of evolution of the PrP regions. Whereas the repeat region is conserved within lineages but differs between lineages, the hydrophobic region is invariably conserved in all the PrPs. Conservation of PrP between marsupials and eutherians suggests that marsupial PrP could have the same pathogenic potential as eutherian PrPs. Using the marsupial PRNP gene in comparison with the PRNP genes from eutherian species in which prion diseases occur naturally (human, bovine, ovine) or experimentally (mouse), I defined gene regions that are conserved mammalian-wide and showed the utility of the marsupial genomic sequence for cross-species comparisons. These regions are potential regulatory elements that could govern gene expression and posttranscriptional control of mRNA activity. These findings shed new light on the normal function of mammalian PRNP supporting best the signal-transduction hypothesis. The normal function of PRNP may be triggering of signalling cascades which contribute to cell-cell interactions and may act anti-apoptotically. Yet, in the heterogenous set of cells expressing PrP^C these pathways will contribute to a number of cell-specific phenotypes, such as the synaptic plasticity and activation of lymphoid cells.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prion protein gene</field><field name="subject">Prion protein</field><field name="subject">Shadow of prion protein gene</field><field name="subject">Shadow protein</field><field name="subject">prions</field><field name="subject">prion diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050328.164529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconceiving the Spoiled Female Identity: Childbearing and Motherhood among Women with Hepatitis C</field><field name="creator">Thetford, H. Clare</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the impact of hepatitis C on women&#146;s childbearing decisions and experiences of motherhood. A partial grounded theory approach was used, in which 34 women living with hepatitis C participated in semi-structured interviews to determine the direct and indirect effects of hepatitis C on their own personal decisions regarding childbearing and to describe their lived experiences of motherhood. The qualitative interview data were analysed thematically, in which common themes were identified and explored.&#182; Three key areas are explored: women&#146;s social experience of hepatitis C; hepatitis C and childbearing decisions; and the meaning of motherhood for women with hepatitis C.&#182;  The interviews revealed that living with hepatitis C had direct effects on the childbearing decisions of women. The direct effects of the virus which impacted on women&#146;s childbearing decisions included poor physical and emotional hepatitis C related health, the perceived risk of vertical transmission of hepatitis C, concerns their future hepatitis C related health might impact upon their mothering abilities, and childbearing can conflict with treatment for hepatitis C. However, of greater importance to these women, appeared to be the indirect effects of living with a virus which is so highly stigmatised within our society. In particular, hepatitis C is closely associated with injecting drug use, which means these women are often assumed to possess the stereotypical characteristics associated with injecting drug users. As a result, they experience widespread medical discrimination and social rejection. Hepatitis C also impacts indirectly upon a wide range of factors that most women in contemporary society take into consideration in their childbearing decisions, for example, available social support, financial security and age.&#182; The experiences reported by these women are discussed in terms of their concordance or discord with prevailing theories of deviance, stigma and the social construction of motherhood. The interview data, considered in light of such theories reveal that possibly the greatest impact that hepatitis C can have upon women is to prevent them from achieving a legitimate adult female status through childbearing and becoming a &#145;good mother&#146;.&#182; The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of public health and social policy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative methods</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C</field><field name="subject">Childbearing decisions</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Social identity</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050331.222115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theory and application of broadband frequency invariant beamforming</field><field name="creator">Ward, Darren Brett</field><field name="description">In many engineering applications, including radar, sonar, communications and seismology, the direction of impinging signal wavefronts can be used to discriminate between competing sources.  Often these source signals cover a wide bandwidth and conventional narrowband beamforming techniques are ineffective, since spatial resolution varies significantly across the band.  In this thesis we consider the problem of beamforming for broadband signals, primarily when the spatial response remains constant as a function of frequency. This is called a frequency invariant beamformer (FIB).&#182;
Rather than applying the numerical technique of multi-parameter optimisation to solve for the beamformer parameters, we attempt to address the fundamental nature of the FIB problem. The general philosophy is to use a theoretical continuous sensor to derive relationships between a desired FI beampattern and the required signal processing structure. Beamforming using an array of discrete sensors can then be formulated as an approximation problem. This approach reveals a natural structure to the FIB which is otherwise buried in a numerical optimisation procedure.&#182;
Measured results from a microphone array are presented to verify that the simple FIB structure can be successfully implemented. We then consider imposing broadband pattern nulls in the FI beampattern, and show that (i) it is possible to impose an exact null which is present over all frequencies, and (ii) it is possible to calculate a priori how many constraints are required to achieve a null of a given depth in a FIB. We also show that the FIB can be applied to the problem of broadband direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and provides computational advantages over other broadband DOA estimators.&#182;
Through the theoretical continuous sensor approach, we show that the FIB theory can be generalised to the problem of designing a general broadband beamformer (GBB) which realizes a broadband angle-versus-frequency beampattern specification. Coupled with a technique for radial beampattern transformation, the GBB can be applied to a wide class of problems covering both nearfield beamforming (in which the shape of the impinging wavefront must be considered and farfield beamforming  (which is simplified by the assumption of planar wavefronts) for a broadband beampattern specified over both angle and frequency.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Broadband frequency</field><field name="subject">beamforming</field><field name="subject">beampattern</field><field name="subject">FIB</field><field name="subject">frequency invariant beamformer</field><field name="subject">GBB</field><field name="subject">general broadband beamformer</field><field name="subject">nearfield</field><field name="subject">farfield</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050418.112459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operational Aspects of Decision Feedback Equalizers</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Rodney Andrew</field><field name="description">The central theme is the study of error propagation effects in decision feedback equalizers (DFEs).  The thesis contains: a stochastic analysis of error propagation in a tuned DFE; an analysis of the effects of error propagation in a blindly adapted DFE; a deterministic analysis of error propagation through input-output stability ideas; and testing procedures for establishing correct tap convergence in blind adaptation.  To a lesser extent, the decision directed equalizer (DDE) is also treated.&#182; Characterizing error propagation using finite state Markov process (FSMP) techniques is first considered.  We classify how the channel and DFE parameters affect the FSMP model and establish tight bounds on the error probability and mean error recovery time of a tuned DFE.  These bounds are shown to be too conservative for practical use and highlight the need for imposing stronger hypotheses on the class of channels for which a DFE may be effectively used.&#182; In blind DFE adaptation we show the effect of decision errors is to distort the adaptation relative to the use of a training sequence.  The mean square error surface in a LMS type setting is shown to be a concatenation of quadratic functions exposing the possibility of false tap convergence to undesirable DFE parameter settings.  Averaging analysis and simulation are used to verify this behaviour on some examples.&#182; Error propagation in a tuned DFE is also examined in a deterministic setting.  A finite error recovery time problem is set up as an input-output stability problem.  Passivity theory is invoked to prove that a DFE can be effectively used on a channel satisfying a simple frequency domain condition.  These results give performance bounds which relate well with practice.&#182; Testing for false tap convergence in blind adaptation concludes our study. Simple statistic output tests are shown to be capable of discerning correct operation of a DDE.  Similar tests are conjectured for the DFE, supported by proofs for the low dimensional cases.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blind equalization</field><field name="subject">decision feedback equalization</field><field name="subject">error propagation</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050418.151329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Limits of Multi-Antenna Wireless Communications in Spatially Selective Channels</field><field name="creator">Pollock, Tony Steven</field><field name="description">Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications systems using multiantenna arrays simultaneously during transmission and reception have generated significant interest in recent years. Theoretical work in the mid 1990?s showed the potential for significant capacity increases in wireless channels via spatial multiplexing with sparse antenna arrays and rich scattering environments. However, in reality the capacity is significantly reduced when the antennas are placed close together, or the scattering environment is sparse, causing the signals received by different antennas to become correlated, corresponding to a reduction of the effective number of sub-channels between transmit and receive antennas. By introducing the previously ignored spatial aspects, namely the antenna array geometry and the scattering environment, into a novel channel model new bounds and fundamental limitations to MIMO capacity are derived for spatially constrained, or spatially selective, channels. A theoretically derived capacity saturation point is shown to exist for spatially selective MIMO channels, at which there is no capacity growth with increasing numbers of antennas. Furthermore, it is shown that this saturation point is dependent on the shape, size and orientation of the spatial volumes containing the antenna arrays along with the properties of the scattering environment. This result leads to the definition of an intrinsic capacity between separate spatial volumes in a continuous scattering environment, which is an upper limit to communication between the volumes that can not be increased with increasing numbers of antennas within. It is shown that there exists a fundamental limit to the information theoretic capacity between two continuous volumes in space, where using antenna arrays is simply one choice of implementation of a more general spatial signal processing underlying all wireless communication systems.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MIMO systems</field><field name="subject">wireless</field><field name="subject">capacity</field><field name="subject">spatial correlation</field><field name="subject">multipath channels</field><field name="subject">non-isotropic scattering</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050418.143712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and change in rural regions: understanding influences on sense of place.</field><field name="creator">Measham, Thomas George</field><field name="description">This thesis is about how people develop attachments to places, and what this means for natural resource management. The concept of &#145;sense of place&#146; is generating strong interest in the domain of natural resource management. In particular, the concept offers considerable potential as a way of integrating social, ecological and economic dimensions of environment.  This makes the concept highly relevant to an emerging agenda from a range of disciplines and management approaches concerned with the links between social systems and natural systems at local and regional scales (Berkes and Folke 1998; Cheng Kruger and Daniels 2003; Plumwood 2002).&#182;
Recent interest in place has led to a research agenda for exploring how this concept can play a greater role in resource management (Cantrill and Senecah 2001).  Central to this research agenda are questions of how attachments to places are influenced and how sense of place changes over time.  In response to the emerging role of sense of place in natural resource management and the research agenda for exploring this concept, this thesis is concerned with three questions: what are the key influences on sense of place?; what is the relationship between sense of place and activities in practice?; and how do people learn about places and respond to change?  To explore these questions, the thesis presents findings from interviews with 40 participants in case studies of the Atherton Tablelands and Woodstock, north Queensland.  The research employed a purposeful sampling design with the aim of capturing as many different senses of place as possible within the limits of this study.  Participants represented a broad range of land uses, ethnic backgrounds, ages and durations of time in the place of the interview. The data from these interviews were analysed using qualitative methods drawing on grounded theory (Charmanz 2000) and influenced by adaptive theory (Layder 1998). The research included a focus on honouring human experience (Braud and Anderson 1998), and also recognising the importance of prior research on how people develop a sense of place (Piaget 1971; Relph 1976).&#182;
The analysis showed how sense of place was influenced strongly by childhood experiences, both for people who grew up in the case study locations and for people who grew up elsewhere.  Other strong influences on place involved living in a similar environment overseas, seeking profit and having a sense of self focussed on agricultural production. Of particular interest is that for many participants who moved to the case study locations, their sense of the Atherton Tablelands or Woodstock was well developed prior to arriving there.  This implies that influencing people&#146;s sense of place once they have arrived in a new place will be difficult. Attempts to influence people&#146;s sense of place before they arrive, or soon after arrival, are more likely to be successful. &#182;
The ways that sense of place related to practice are presented as a series of overlapping themes. These include the practice of admiring one&#146;s place from the comfort of home, making the land produce, and engaging with a place through activities such as hunting, camping and fishing. Participants also described the practice of caring for place, such as looking after traditional country and restoring the family farm. &#182;
The ways participants learned about their places focussed on their childhood experiences, learning from elders, the role of comparisons between places, and the importance of continuity of experience.  Participants described very few ways of learning about their place during adulthood.  One of these was seeing places under different conditions, such as during a rat plague or after a bushfire.  Another was through involvement in community events such as festivals.&#182;
In discussing the implications of these findings for natural resource management and policy, the thesis highlights how for several participants the key influences on sense of place were tied to non-economic values.  Furthermore, this thesis shows that for many people identity and place were strongly linked and this adds to research that explains why farmers may not behave in economically &#145;rational&#146; ways (Botterill 2001a).  The thesis also discusses the links between sense of place and post-productivist values in considering transitions in regional Australia identified by Holmes (2002).  The findings of this thesis emphasise the potential role for environmental education during childhood to encourage learning about places. The thesis also discusses the implications of how people learn about their places during adulthood, arguing that further support for festivals and community events can play a significant role in exploring the links between social and ecological systems.&#182;
In conclusion, the thesis argues that the concept of place continues to offer considerable potential for understanding change in regional Australia, and in particular a grass roots shift towards post-productivist values.  This role can be developed by further supporting environmental education in childhood and community events such as festivals which help us to learn about the links between ourselves and our environments.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural resource management</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">sense of place</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050421.162409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In silico analysis of C-type lectin domains&#146; structure and properties</field><field name="creator">Zelensky, Alex N.</field><field name="description">Members of the C-type lectin domain (CTLD) superfamily are metazoan proteins functionally important in glycoprotein metabolism, mechanisms of multicellular integration and immunity. This thesis presents the results of several computational and experimental studies of the CTLD structure, function and evolution.&#182;

Core structural properties of the CTLD fold were explored in a comparative analysis of the 37 distinct CTLD structures available publicly, which demonstrate significant structural conservation despite low or undetectable sequence similarity. Pairwise structural alignments of all CTLD structures were created with three different methods (DALI, CE and LOCK) and analysed manually and using a computational algorithm developed for this purpose. The analysis revealed a set of conserved positions and interactions, which were classified based on their role in CTLD structure maintenance.&#182; 

The CTLD family is large and diverse. To organize and annotate the several thousand of known CTLD-containing protein sequences and integrate the information on their evolution, structure and function a local database and a web-based interface to it were developed. The software is written in Perl, is based on bioperl, bioperl-db and Apache::ASP modules, and can be used for collaborative annotation of any collection of phylogenetically related sequences.&#182;

Several studies of CTLD genomics were performed. In one such study, carried out in collaboration with the RIKEN structural genomics centre, CTLD sequences from the Caenorhabditis elegans genome were identified and clustered into groups based on similarity. The most representative members of the groups were then selected, which if characterized structurally would tell most about the C. elegans CTLDs and provide templates for homology modelling of all C. elegans CTLD structures.&#182; 

In the other whole-genome study, the CTLD family in the puffer fish Fugu rubripes was analysed using the draft genome sequence. This work extended and complemented three genome-level surveys on human, C. elegans and D. melanogaster reported previously. The study showed that the CTLD repertoire of Fugu rubripes is very similar to that of mammals, although several interesting differences exist, and that Fugu CTLD-encoding genes are selectively duplicated in a manner suggesting an ancient large-scale duplication event. Another important finding was the identification of several new CTLDcps, which had mammalian orthologues not recognized previously.&#182; 

CBCP, a novel CTLD-containing protein highly conserved between fish and mammals with previously unknown domain architecture, was predicted in the Fugu study based solely on ab initio gene models from the Fugu locus and cross-species genomic DNA alignments. To test if the prediction was correct, a full-length cDNA of the mouse CBCP was cloned, its tissue distribution characterized and untranslated regions determined by RACE. The full-length mCBCP transcript is 10 kb long, encodes a protein of 2172 amino acids and confirms the original prediction. The presence of a large N-terminal NG2 domain makes CBCP a member of a small but very interesting family of Metazoan proteins.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">C-type lectin domain</field><field name="subject">bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">CTLD</field><field name="subject">protein structure analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050318.185314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational petrology: Subsolidus equilibria in the upper mantle</field><field name="creator">Sommacal, Silvano</field><field name="description">Processes that take place in the Earth&#146;s mantle are not accessible to direct observation. Natural samples of mantle material that have been transported to the surface as xenoliths provide useful information on phase relations and compositions of phases at the pressure and temperature conditions of each rock fragment. In the past, considerable effort has been devoted by petrologists to investigate upper mantle processes experimentally. Results of high temperatures, high pressure experiments have provided insight into lower crust-upper mantle phase relations as a function of temperature, pressure and composition. However, the attainment of equilibrium in these experiments, especially in complex systems, may be very difficult to test rigorously. Furthermore, experimental results may also require extrapolation to different pressures, temperatures or bulk compositions. More recently, thermodynamic modeling has proved to be a very powerful approach to this problem, allowing the deciphering the physicochemical conditions at which mantle processes occur. On the other hand, a comprehensive thermodynamic model to investigate lower crust-upper mantle phase assemblages in complex systems does not exist. &#182;
In this study, a new thermodynamic model to describe phase equilibria between silicate and/or oxide crystalline phases has been derived. For every solution phase the molar Gibbs free energy is given by the sum of contributions from the energy of the end-members, ideal mixing on sites, and excess site mixing terms. It is here argued that the end-member term of the Gibbs free energy for complex solid solution phases (e.g. pyroxene, spinel) has not previously been treated in the most appropriate manner. As an example, the correct expression of this term for a pyroxene solution in a general (Na-Ca-Mg-Fe2+-Al-Cr-Fe3+-Si-Ti) system is presented and the principle underlying its formulation for any complex solution phase is elucidated.&#182;
Based on the thermodynamic model an algorithm to compute lower crust-upper mantle phase equilibria for subsolidus mineral assemblages as a function of composition, temperature and pressure has been developed. Included in the algorithm is a new way to represent the total Gibbs free energy for any multi-phase complex system. At any given temperature and pressure a closed multi-phase system is at its equilibrium condition when the chemical composition of the phases present in the system and the number of moles of each are such that the Gibbs free energy of the system reaches its minimum value. From a mathematical point of view, the determination of equilibrium phase assemblages can, in short, be defined as a constrained minimization problem. To solve the Gibbs free energy minimization problem a &#145;Feasible Iterate Sequential Quadratic Programming&#146; method (FSQP) is employed. The system&#146;s Gibbs free energy is minimized under several different linear and non-linear constraints. The algorithm, coded as a highly flexible FORTRAN computer program (named &#145;Gib&#146;), has been set up, at the moment, to perform equilibrium calculations in NaO-CaO-MgO-FeO-Al2O3-Cr2O3-Fe2O3- SiO2-TiO2 systems. However, the program is designed in a way that any other oxide component could be easily added.&#182; 
To accurately forward model phase equilibria compositions using &#145;Gib&#146;, a precise estimation of the thermodynamic data for mineral end-members and of the solution parameters that will be adopted in the computation is needed. As a result, the value of these parameters had to be derived/refined for every solution phase in the investigated systems. A computer program (called &#145;GibInv&#146;) has been set up, and its implementation is here described in detail, that allows the simultaneous refinement of any of the end-member and mixing parameters. Derivation of internally consistent thermodynamic data is obtained by making use of the Bayesian technique. The program, after being successfully tested in a synthetic case, is initially applied to pyroxene assemblages in the system CaO-MgO-FeO-Al2O3-SiO2 (i.e. CMFAS) and in its constituent subsystems. Preliminary results are presented.&#182; 
The new thermodynamic model is then applied to assemblages of Ca-Mg-Fe olivines and to assemblages of coexisting pyroxenes (orthopyroxene, low Ca- and high Ca clinopyroxene; two or three depending on T-P-bulk composition conditions), in CMFAS system and subsystems. Olivine and pyroxene solid solution and end-member parameters are refined, in part using &#145;GibInv&#146; and in part on a &#145;trial and error&#146; basis, and, when necessary, new parameters are derived. Olivine/pyroxene phase relations within such systems and their subsystems are calculated over a wide range of temperatures and pressures and compare very favorably with experimental constraints.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multisite crystalline solid solutions</field><field name="subject">Gibbs free energy minimization</field><field name="subject">forward modeling</field><field name="subject">inverse modeling</field><field name="subject">olivine and pyroxene thermodynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050415.151025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection and Estimation in Digital Wireless Communications</field><field name="creator">Borah, Deva  Kanta</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates  reliable data communication techniques for wireless channels. The problem of data detection at the receiver is considered  and several novel detectors and parameter estimators are presented.&#182;
 
It is shown that by using  a  noise-limiting prefilter,  with a spectral support at least equal to the signal part of the received signal, and sampling its output at the Nyquist rate, a set of sufficient statistics for  maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) is obtained.&#182;
 
Observing that  the time-variations of the multipaths in a wireless channel are
bandlimited, channel taps are closely approximated as polynomials in time. Using this representation,  detection techniques for frequency-flat and frequency-selective channels are obtained. The proposed  polynomial predictor based sequence
detector (PPSD) for frequency-flat channels  is similar in structure to the MLSD that employs channel prediction. However,  the PPSD  uses {\em a priori} known
 polynomial based predictor taps.  It is observed that the PPSD, without any explicit knowledge of the channel autocovariance,  performs close to the Innovations based  MLSD.&#182;
 
New techniques for frequency-selective channel estimation are presented. They are  based on a rectangular windowed least squares algorithm, and they employ  a
polynomial model of the channel taps.  A recursive form of the least squares algorithm with orthonormal polynomial basis vectors is developed. Given the appropriate window size and  polynomial model order, the proposed method  outperforms the conventional least mean squares (LMS) and the exponentially weighted recursive least squares (EW-RLS) algorithms. Novel algorithms are proposed to obtain near optimal window size and polynomial model order.&#182;
 
The improved channel estimation techniques developed for frequency-selective channels are  incorporated into  sliding window and fixed block channel estimators. The sliding window estimator uses  received samples over a time window to calculate the channel taps.  Every symbol period, the window is moved along another symbol period and a new estimate is calculated. A fixed block estimator uses all
received samples to estimate the channel taps throughout a data packet, all at once. In fast fading and at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), both techniques
outperform the  MLSD receivers which employ the LMS algorithm for channel estimation.&#182;

An adaptive multiuser detector, optimal in the weighted least squares (WLS) sense,  is derived for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA)  systems. In a multicellular configuration, this detector  jointly detects   the users within the cell of interest,  while suppressing the intercell interferers in a WLS sense. In the absence of intercell interferers, the detector reduces to the well-known multiuser MLSD structure that employs a bank of matched filters. The relationship between the proposed detector and  a centralized decision feedback detector is derived. The effects of narrowband interference  are investigated and compared with the multiuser MLSD.&#182;
 
Since in a fast time-varying channel, the LMS or the EW-RLS algorithms cannot track the channel variations effectively, the receiver structures proposed for single user communications are extended to multiuser DS-CDMA systems. The fractionally-chip-spaced  channel taps of the convolution of the chip waveform with the multipath channel are estimated.   Linear equalizer, decision feedback equalizer
and MLSDs  are studied, and under fast fading, as the SNR increases, they are found to outperform  the LMS based adaptive minimum mean squared error (MMSE) linear receivers.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data detection</field><field name="subject">channel estimation</field><field name="subject">code division multiple access</field><field name="subject">adaptive algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050506.015503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourses of 'China' in International Relations: A Study in Western Theory as (IR) Practice</field><field name="creator">Pan, Chengxin</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with both the dangers and opportunities of China&#146;s relations with the contemporary world and with the U.S.-led West in particular. It takes an unconventional approach to these issues in critically examining mainstream Western studies of Chinese foreign policy as a particular kind of discourse. The thesis focuses, more specifically, on the two dominant Western perspectives on China, (neo)realism and (neo)-liberalism. In doing so, it engages the questions of how Western discursive practice has come to shape and dominate the ways we think of and deal with &#145;China&#146; in international relations, and how, as a result, China has often come to formulate its foreign policy in line with the prescribed meaning given to it by Western-based China scholars. In this context, the thesis argues that to deconstruct the processes by which China is given particular &#145;meanings&#146; by Western discourses&#151;and by which those meanings are transformed into both Western and Chinese foreign policy&#151;is the key to a more profound understanding of Sino-Western relations and, perhaps, a first step towards ameliorating its problems and realising its potential for long-term peace and mutual prosperity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">the West</field><field name="subject">the United States</field><field name="subject">foreign policy</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">representation</field><field name="subject">Other</field><field name="subject">social construction</field><field name="subject">(neo)realism</field><field name="subject">(neo)liberalism</field><field name="subject">intimate enemy</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050528.132232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduced Complexity Equalization for Data Communication</field><field name="creator">McGinty, Nigel</field><field name="description">Optimal decision directed equalization techniques for time dispersive communication channels are often too complex to implement.  This thesis considers reduced complexity decision directed equalization that lowers complexity demands yet retains close to optimal performance.  The first part of this dissertation consists of three reduced complexity algorithms based on the Viterbi Algorithm (VA) which are: the Parallel Trellis VA (PTVA); Time Reverse Reduced State Sequence Estimation (TR-RSSE); and Forward-Backward State Sequence Detection (FBSSD).  The second part of the thesis considers structural modifications of the Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE), which is a special derivative of the VA, specifically, optimal vector quantization for fractionally spaced DFEs, and extended stability regions for baud spaced DFEs using passivity analysis are investigated.&#182;

For a special class of sparse channels the VA can be decomposed over a number of independent parallel trellises.  This decomposition will be called the Parallel Trellis Viterbi Algorithm and can have lower complexity than the VA yet it retains optimal performance.  By relaxing strict sparseness constraints on the channel a sub-optimal approach is proposed which keeps complexity low and obtains good performance.&#182;

Reduced State Sequence Estimation (RSSE) is a popular technique to reduce complexity.  However, its deficiency can be the inability to adequately equalize non-minimum phase channels.  For channels that have energy peaks in the tail of the impulse response (post-cursor dominant) RSSE's complexity must be close to the VA or performance will be poor. Using a property of the VA which makes it invariant to channel reversal, TR-RSSE is proposed to extend application of RSSE to post-cursor dominant channels.&#182;

To further extend the class of channels suitable for RSSE type processing, FBSSD is suggested.  This uses a two pass processing method, and is suited to channels that have low energy pre and post-cursor.  The first pass generates preliminary estimates used in the second pass to aid the decision process.  FBSSD can range from RSSE to TR-RSSE depending on parameter settings.&#182;

The DFE is obtained when the complexity of RSSE is minimized.  Two characterizing properties of the DFE, which are addressed in this thesis, are feedback and quantization.  A novel fractionally spaced (FS) DFE structure is presented which allows the quantizer to be generalized relative to the quantizer used in conventional FS-DFEs.  The quantizer can be designed according  to a maximum   a posteriori criterion which takes into account a priori statistical knowledge of error occurrences.  A radically different quantizer can be obtained using this technique which can result in significant performance improvements.&#182;

Due to the feedback nature of the DFE a form of stability can be considered.  After a decision error occurs, a stable DFE will, after some finite time and in the absence of noise, operate error free.  Passivity analysis provides sufficient conditions to determine a class of channels which insures a DFE will be stable.  Under conditions of short channels and small modulation alphabets, it is proposed that conventional passivity analysis can be extended to account for varying operator gains, leading to weaker sufficient conditions for stability (larger class of channels).</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equalization</field><field name="subject">Equalisation</field><field name="subject">Intersymbol Interference</field><field name="subject">Viterbi Algorithm</field><field name="subject">Decision Feedback Equalizer</field><field name="subject">Data Communications</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050602.122741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Approaches to the Regional Security Analysis of Southeast Asia</field><field name="creator">Khoo, How San</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to critically evaluate three scholarly perspectives -- balance of power, institutional, and security complex -- to examine the evolving dynamics of security interdependence and inter-state relations among Southeast Asian states and external powers since 1945. This study is thus a comparative evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the three methods in their empirical analysis of the regional security dynamics of Southeast Asia.&#182;
There is much merit in the balance of power approach. It tracked the consequences of the bipolar Cold War rivalry on Southeast Asia. Its logical construction led it to be concerned with alliances, coalitions and alignments. But it has not satisfactorily explained the relatively benign conditions after the Cold War. The institutional approach similarly emphasizes material explanatory factors (although, in its case, not exclusively so). It identifies the emergence of institutions when groups of countries find it in their mutual interest to cooperate through rules and norms. But the approach may prove to be incomplete in assessing ASEAN's post-Cold War behaviour. As an analytical device, the security complex is deployed to provide a corrective to the over-emphasis (of the other two approaches) on the systemic dynamics. By identifying regional and local dynamics interacting with systemic dynamics via patterns of amity and enmity, it offers explanatory accounts of the behaviour of regional states in situations where the other two approaches fail to do satisfactorily. Moreover, it provides a framework for the deployment of constructivism, which identifies the ideational process whereby interdependent regional states respond to changes in both the power and amity-enmity attributes.&#182; 
This study concludes that security relations among Southeast Asian states and in their relations with external powers after the Cold War, are better examined using the three approaches in a complementary manner. In this way, the influence of local amity-enmity patterns is seen to impact on balance of power and institutional situations.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">balance of power</field><field name="subject">institutional</field><field name="subject">security complex</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">regional security analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050617.140925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning from the past for sustainability: towards an integrated approach</field><field name="creator">Proust, Katrina Margaret</field><field name="description">The task of producing policies for the management of Earth&#8217;s natural resources is a problem of the gravest concern worldwide. Such policies must address both responsible use in the present and the sustainability of those finite resources in the future. Resources are showing the adverse results of generations of exploitation, and communities fail to see the outcomes of past policies that have produced, and continue to produce, these results. They have not learned from past policy failures, and consequently fail to produce natural resource management (NRM) policies that support sustainable development.&#182; 
It will be argued that NRM policy makers fail to learn from the past because they do not have a good historical perspective and a clear understanding of the dynamics of the complex human-environment system that they manage. It will also be argued that historians have not shown an interest in collaborating with policy makers on these issues, even though they have much to offer. Therefore, a new approach is proposed, which brings the skills and understanding of the trained historian directly into the policy arena.&#182; 
This approach is called Applied Environmental History (AEH). Its aims are to help establish an area of common conceptual ground between NRM practitioners, policy makers, historians and dynamicists; to provide a framework that can help NRM practitioners and policy makers to take account of the historical and dynamical issues that characterise human-environment relationships; and to help NRM practitioners and policy makers improve their capacity to learn from the past. 
Applied Environmental History captures the characteristics of public and applied history and environmental history. In order to include an understanding of feedback dynamics in human-environment systems, it draws on concepts from dynamical systems theory. Because learning from the past is a particular form of learning from experience, AEH also draws on theories of cognitive adaptation.&#182; 
Principles for the application of AEH are developed and then tested in an exploratory study of irrigation development that is focused on the NRM issue of salinity. Since irrigation salinity has existed for centuries, and is a serious environmental problem in many parts of the world, it is a suitable NRM context in which to explore policy makers' failure to learn from the past. AEH principles guide this study, and are used, together with insights generated from the study, as the basis for the design of AEH Guidelines.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">applied environmental history</field><field name="subject">integrated research</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">feedback

terms of Aboriginal people&#8217;s and white people&#8217;s social relations, in a small
selection of popular fiction texts from the 1950s and 1960s. I situate these
novels in the broader context of assimilation by also undertaking a
reading of three official texts from a slightly earlier period. These texts
together produce the ambivalent white Australian story of assimilation.
They illuminate some of the key sites of anxiety in assimilation discourses:
inter-racial sexual relationships, the white family, and children and young
adults of mixed heritage and land ownership. The crux of my argument is
that in the 1950s and early 1960s the dominant cultural imagining of
Australia was as a white nation. In white discourses of assimilation to
fulfil the dream of whiteness, the Aboriginal people &#8211; the not-white &#8211; had
to be included in or eliminated from this imagined white community.
Fictional stories of assimilation were a key site for the representation of
this process, that is, they produced discourses of &#8216;assimilation
colonization&#8217;. The focus for this process were Aboriginal people of mixed
ancestry, who came to be represented as &#8216;the half-caste&#8217; in assimilation
discourse. The novels I analyse work as &#8216;conduct books&#8217;. They aim to
shape white reactions to the inclusion of Aboriginal people, in particular
the half-caste, into &#8216;white Australia&#8217;. This inclusion, assimilation, was an
ambivalent project &#8211; both pleasurable and unsettling &#8211; pleasurable
because it worked to legitimate white colonization (Aboriginal presence as
erased) and unsettling because it challenged the idea of a pure &#8216;white

Firstly, techniques used in the past, such as the Direct Fourier Method (DFM) or various backprojection techniques, have only been able to reconstruct areas of the flow which are upstream of any opaque objects, such as a model. Secondly, shock waves create sharp discontinuities in flow properties, which can be difficult to reconstruct both in position and in magnitude.

This thesis will present a reconstruction method, utilising geometric ray-tracing and a sparse matrix iterative solver, which is capable of overcoming both of these challenges. It will be shown, through testing with phantom objects described in imaging and tomographic literature, that the results are comparable to those produced by the DFM technique.

These models and practises might be communicated in an interesting manner using the new medium of the digital game, yet very few digital games based upon scientific simulations have been created and thus the potential of such games to facilitate scientific knowledge construction cannot be studied directly. Scientific simulations have, however, been much used by scientists to facilitate their own knowledge construction, and equally, both simulations and games have been used by science educators to facilitate knowledge construction on the part of their students. The large academic literatures relating to these simulations and games collectively demonstrate that their ability to: re-create reality; model complex systems; be visual and interactive; engage the user in the practise of science; and to engage the user in construction and collaboration, makes them powerful tools for facilitating scientific knowledge construction. Moreover, the large non-academic literature discussing the nature of digital games (which are themselves both simulations and games) demonstrates that their ability to perform the above tasks (i.e. to re-create reality, model complex systems, and so forth) is what makes them enjoyable to play.&#182;Because the features of scientific and educational simulations and games that facilitate knowledge construction are the very same features that make digital games enjoyable to play, the player of a scientific-simulation-based digital game would be simultaneously gaining enjoyment and acquiring scientific knowledge.

This dissertation seeks to examine the dynamics of the history from the beginnings of urbanization until the rise of the Burmese empire which subsequently dominated Arakanese culture. The first chapter deals with the geographical and ethnolinguistic background to the development of the earliest cities. In the second, all the inscriptions of the period, in Sanskrit, Pali and Pyu are catalogued and edited. The inscriptions issued by the kings establish a chronology for the period and illustrate the nature of the cult surrounding the institution of kingship, while copper-plate and votive inscriptions elucidate the nature of state organisation and the popular religion. Chapter Three deals with the coinage which emerged following the development of a centralised economy, and discusses the impetus for this and the role of the king on whom the prosperity of the country depended. A comparison with similar coin types in Southeast Asia is made and the catalogue includes all the coins yet discovered. The sites of the most important monuments are discussed in Chapter Four, which catalogues all the architectural and sculptural remains. A comparative analysis of the Buddhist and Hindu images and of the minor arts reveals, to a greater extent that do the inscriptions, the nature of contact with India and the rest of Southeast Asia. The conclusion deals with the political and cultural history which thus emerges, examining in detail the rationale behind the development of the concept of divine kingship in Arakan.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arakan</field><field name="subject">Burma</field><field name="subject">eastern India</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Arakanese culture</field><field name="subject">inscriptions</field><field name="subject">Sanskrit</field><field name="subject">Pali</field><field name="subject">Pyu</field><field name="subject">copper-plate</field><field name="subject">votive inscriptions</field><field name="subject">coinage</field><field name="subject">kingship</field><field name="subject">Buddhist and Hindu images</field><field name="subject">monuments</field><field name="subject">cultural history</field><field name="subject">art and architecture</field><field name="subject">east Bengal</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050901.112732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Child growth and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in a Queensland Aboriginal Community</field><field name="creator">Bambrick, Hilary Jane</field><field name="description">Globally, the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is rising. The most affected populations are those that have undergone recent and rapid transition towards a Western lifestyle, characterised by energy-dense diets and physical inactivity.&#182;
Two major hypotheses have attempted to explain the variation in diabetes prevalence, both between and within populations, beyond the contributions made by adult lifestyle. The thrifty genotype hypothesis proposes that some populations are genetically well adapted to surviving in a subsistence environment, and are predisposed to develop diabetes when the dietary environment changes to one that is fat and carbohydrate rich. The programming hypothesis focuses on the developmental environment, particularly on prenatal and early postnatal conditions: nutritional deprivation in utero and early postnatal life, measured by low birthweight and disrupted child growth, is proposed to alter metabolism permanently so that risk of diabetes is increased with subsequent exposure to an energy-dense diet. Both hypotheses emphasise discord between adaptation (genetic or developmental) and current environment, and both now put forward insulin resistance as a likely mechanism for predisposition.&#182;
Diabetes contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality among Australia&#8217;s Indigenous population. Indigenous babies are more likely to be low birthweight, and typical patterns of child growth include periods of faltering and rapid catch-up. Although there have been numerous studies in other populations, the programming hypothesis has not previously been tested in an Australian Indigenous community. The framework of the programming hypothesis is thus expanded to consider exposure of whole populations to adverse prenatal and postnatal environments, and the influence this may have on diabetes prevalence.&#182;
The present study took place in Cherbourg, a large Aboriginal community in southeast Queensland with a high prevalence of diabetes. Study participants were adults with diagnosed diabetes and a random sample of adults who had never been diagnosed with diabetes. Data were collected on five current risk factors for diabetes (general and central obesity, blood pressure, age and family history), in addition to fasting blood glucose levels. A lifestyle survey was also conducted. Participants&#8217; medical records detailing weight growth from birth to five years were analysed with regard to adult diabetes risk to determine whether childhood weight and rate of weight gain were associated with subsequent diabetes. Adult lifestyle factors were
xiialso explored to determine whether variation in nutrition and physical activity was related to level of diabetes risk.&#182;
Approximately 20% of adults in Cherbourg have diagnosed diabetes. Prevalence may be as high as 38.5% in females and 42% in males if those who are high-risk (abnormal fasting glucose and three additional factors) are included. Among those over 40 years, total prevalence is estimated to be 51% for females and 59% for males.&#182;
Patterns of early childhood growth may contribute to risk of diabetes among adults. In particular, relatively rapid weight growth to five years is associated with both general and central obesity among adult women. This lends some qualified support to the programming hypothesis as catch-up growth has previously been incorporated into the model; however, although the most consistent association was found among those who gained weight more rapidly, it was also found that risk is increased among children who are heavier at any age.&#182;
No consistent associations were found between intrauterine growth retardation (as determined by lower than median birthweight and higher than median weight growth velocity to one and three months) and diabetes risk among women or men. A larger study sample with greater statistical power may have yielded less ambiguous results.&#182;
Among adults, levels of physical activity may be more important than nutritional intake in moderating diabetes risk, although features of diet, such as high intake of simple carbohydrates, may contribute to risk in the community overall, especially in the context of physical inactivity. A genetic component is not ruled out. Two additional areas which require further investigation include stress and high rates of infection, both of which are highly relevant to the study community, and may contribute to the insulin resistance syndrome.&#182;
Some accepted thresholds indicating increased diabetes risk may not be appropriate in this population. Given the relationship between waist circumference and other diabetes risk factors and the propensity for central fat deposition among women even with low body mass index (BMI), it is recommended that the threshold where BMI is considered a risk be lowered by 5kg/m2 for women, while no such recommendation is made for men.&#182;
There are a number of social barriers to better community health, including attitudes to exercise and obesity, patterns of alcohol and tobacco use and consumption of fresh foods. Some of these barriers are exacerbated by gender roles and expectations.&#182;</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Indigenous community</field><field name="subject">Barker hypothesis</field><field name="subject">birthweight</field><field name="subject">Cherbourg</field><field name="subject">child growth</field><field name="subject">Indigenous health</field><field name="subject">maternal health</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">programming</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">risk factors</field><field name="subject">thrifty genotype</field><field name="subject">type 2 diabetes</field><field name="subject">western lifestyle</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050905.121211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data-Dependent Analysis of Learning Algorithms</field><field name="creator">Philips, Petra Camilla</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the generalization ability  of machine learning algorithms in a statistical setting. It focuses on the data-dependent analysis of   the generalization performance of learning algorithms in order to make full use of the potential of the actual training sample from which these algorithms learn.&#182;


First, we propose an extension of the standard framework for the derivation of
generalization bounds for algorithms taking their hypotheses from random classes of functions. This approach is motivated by the fact that the function produced by a learning algorithm based on a random sample of data depends on this sample and is therefore a random function. Such an approach  avoids the detour of the worst-case uniform bounds as done in the standard approach. We show that the mechanism which allows one to obtain generalization bounds for random classes in our framework is based on a &#8220;small complexity&#8221; of certain random coordinate 
projections. We demonstrate how  this notion of complexity relates to learnability 
and how one can  explore geometric properties of these projections in order to derive estimates of rates of convergence and good confidence interval estimates for the expected risk. We then demonstrate the generality of our new approach by presenting  a range of examples, among them the algorithm-dependent compression schemes and the data-dependent  luckiness
frameworks, which fall into our random subclass framework.&#182;


Second, we study in more detail generalization bounds for a specific algorithm which is of  central importance in learning theory, namely the Empirical Risk Minimization algorithm (ERM). Recent results  show that one can significantly improve the high-probability estimates for the convergence rates for empirical minimizers by a direct analysis of the ERM algorithm.
These results are based on a new localized notion of complexity of subsets of hypothesis functions with identical expected errors and are therefore dependent on the underlying unknown distribution. We investigate the extent to which one can estimate these high-probability convergence rates in a data-dependent manner. We provide an algorithm which computes a data-dependent upper bound for the expected error of empirical minimizers in terms of the &#8220;complexity&#8221; of data-dependent local subsets. These subsets are sets of functions of empirical errors of a given range and can be 
determined based solely on empirical data. 
We then show that recent direct estimates, which are essentially sharp estimates on the high-probability convergence rate for the ERM algorithm, can not be recovered universally from empirical data.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">statistical learning theory</field><field name="subject">generalization bounds</field><field name="subject">data-dependent complexity</field><field name="subject">machine learning algorithms</field><field name="subject">empirical risk minimization</field><field name="subject">empirical process theory</field><field name="subject">concentration inequalities</field><field name="subject">Rademacher averages</field><field name="subject">localized complexities</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050901.204523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catchment Scale Modelling of Water Quality and Quantity</field><field name="creator">Newham, Lachlan Thomas Hopkins</field><field name="description">Appropriately constructed pollutant export models can help set management priorities for catchments, identify critical pollutant source areas, and are important tools for developing and evaluating economically viable ways of minimising surface water pollution.&#182;
This thesis presents a comparison, an evaluation and an integration of models for predicting the export of environmental pollutants, in particular sediment, through river systems. A review of the capabilities and limitations of current water quality modelling approaches is made. Several water quality and quantity modelling approaches are applied and evaluated in the catchment of the upper Murrumbidgee River.&#182;
The IHACRES rainfall-runoff model and a simple hydrologic routing model are applied with the aim of developing a capacity to predict streamflow at various catchment scales and to enable integration with other pollutant load estimation techniques. Methods for calculating pollutant loads from observed pollutant concentration and modelled streamflow data are also investigated. Sediment export is estimated using these methods over a 10-year period for two case study subcatchments. Approaches for water quality sampling are discussed and a novel monitoring program using rising stage siphon samplers is presented.
Results from a refinement of the Sediment River Network model in the upper Murrumbidgee catchment (SedNet-UM) are presented. The model provides a capacity to quantify sediment source, transport and to simulate the effects of management change in the catchment. The investigation of the model includes rigorous examination of the behaviour of the model through sensitivity assessment and comparison with other sediment modelling studies. The major conclusion reached through sensitivity assessment was that the outputs of the model are most sensitive to perturbation of the hydrologic parameters of the model.&#182;
The SedNet-UM application demonstrates that it is possible to construct stream pollutant models that assist in prioritising management across catchment scales. It can be concluded that SedNet and similar variants have much potential to address common resource management issues requiring the identification of the source, propagation and fate of environmental pollutants. In addition, incorporating the strengths of a conceptual rainfall-runoff model and the semi-distributed SedNet model has been identified as very useful for the future prediction of environmental pollutant export.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water quality modelling</field><field name="subject">hydrologic modelling</field><field name="subject">sensitivity analysis</field><field name="subject">pollutant load estimation</field><field name="subject">water quality monitoring</field><field name="subject">Murrumbidgee River catchment</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050919.144548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public Deliberation and Interest Organisations: a Study of Responses to Lay Citizen Engagement in Public Policy</field><field name="creator">Hendriks, Carolyn Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis empirically examines how lobby groups and activists respond to innovative forms of public participation. The study centres on processes that foster a particular kind
of deliberative governance including citizens&#8217; juries, consensus conferences and planning cells. These deliberative designs bring together a panel of randomly selected lay citizens
to deliberate on a specific policy issue for a few days, with the aim of providing decision makers with a set of recommendations. While policy makers worldwide are attracted to these novel participatory processes, little consideration has been given to how well they work alongside more adversarial and interest-based politics. This doctoral research project examines this interface by studying what these processes mean to different kinds of policy actors such as corporations, advocacy groups, government agencies, experts
and professionals. These entities are collectively referred to in this thesis as &#8216;interest organisations&#8217; because in some way they are seeking a specific policy outcome from the
state &#8211; even government-based groups.&#182;
The empirical research in this thesis is based on comparative case studies of four deliberative design projects in Australia and Germany. The Australian cases include a citizens&#8217; jury on waste management legislation and a consensus conference on gene
technology in the food chain. The German case studies include a planning cells project on consumer protection in Bavaria, and a national consensus conference on genetic diagnostics. Together the cases capture a diversity of complex and contested policy
issues facing post-industrialised societies. In each case study, I examine how relevant interest organisations responded to the deliberative forum, and then interpret these responses in view of the context and features of the case.&#182;
The picture emerging from the in-depth case studies is that interest organisations respond to deliberative designs in a variety of ways. Some choose to participate actively,
others passively decline, and a few resort to strategic tactics to undermine citizens&#8217; deliberations. The empirical research reveals that though responses are variable, most
interest organisations are challenged by several features of the deliberative design model including: 1) that deliberators are citizens with no knowledge or association with the
issue; 2) that experts and interest representatives are required to present their arguments before a citizens&#8217; panel; and 3) that policy discussions occur under deliberative conditions which can expose the illegitimate use of power.&#182;
Despite these challenges, the paradox is that many interest organisations do decide to engage in lay citizen deliberations. The empirical research indicates that groups and experts value deliberative designs if they present an opportunity for public relations, customer feedback, or advocacy. Moreover, the research finds that when policy actors
intensively engage with &#8216;ordinary&#8217; citizens, their technocratic and elite ideas about public participation can shift in a more inclusive and deliberative direction.&#182;
The thesis finds that, on the whole, weaker interest organisations are more willing to engage with lay citizens than stronger organisations because they welcome the chance to influence public debate and decision makers. It appears that powerful groups will only
engage in a deliberative forum under certain policy conditions, for example, when the dominant policy paradigm is unstable and contested, when public discussion on the issue is emerging, when policy networks are interdependent and heterogeneous, and when the broader social and political system supports public accountability, consensus and
deliberation. Given that these kinds of policy conditions do not always exist, I conclude that tensions between interest organisations and deliberative governance will be common. In order to create more cooperative and productive interfaces, I recommend
that interest organisations be better supported and integrated into citizens&#8217; deliberations, and that steps be taken to safeguard forums from strategic attempts to undermine their
legitimacy.&#182;
The thesis also sends out three key messages to democratic theorists. First, the empirical research shows that different kinds of groups and actors in civil society vary in their
willingness and capacity to participate to public deliberation. Second, the deliberative design model demonstrates that partisan actors, such as interest organisations, will engage in public deliberation when they can participate as strategic deliberators. In this role
partisans are not expected to relinquish their agendas, but present them as testimonies before a group of deliberators. Third, the empirical research in this thesis should bring
home to theorists that deliberative forums are closely linked to the discursive context within which they operate.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">deliberative democracy</field><field name="subject">deliberation</field><field name="subject">deliberative governance</field><field name="subject">interests</field><field name="subject">activism</field><field name="subject">interest groups</field><field name="subject">lobby groups</field><field name="subject">activists</field><field name="subject">lay citizens</field><field name="subject">deliberative processes</field><field name="subject">public participation</field><field name="subject">random selection</field><field name="subject">communicative action</field><field name="subject">strategic action</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="subject">interpretive policy analysis</field><field name="subject">comparative case studies</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Germany</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050921.103047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solving Mammalian Riddles</field><field name="creator">Meijaard, Erik</field><field name="description">Since the mid 19th century, the biogeography of island South-East Asia has been the subject of much study. Early researchers explained many of the species distribution patterns by the rise and fall of sea levels and land. This and the work of other researchers culminated in a theory that emphasized the role of Pleistocene sea level low stands in species evolution. With the advent of newly developed molecular techniques, however, it became clear that many species divergence events had taken place before the Pleistocene and a biogeographical theory focusing on Pleistocene sea level changes was inadequate. In this research, I have developed a new biogeographic model that explains present-day distribution patterns and evolutionary relationships between species. I use this new model to explain 10 &#8216;mammalian riddles&#8217;, i.e. evolutionary or distribution patterns in selected mammal species groups that could not be explained with the existing theories. I developed the new model by analyzing the geological literature for this region, and by mapping palaeogeographical and palaeoenvironmental changes for the last 20 million years. In addition I compiled information on the palaeontological record for the region and on divergence times between taxa using a molecular clock assumption. These phylogenetic data were compared with the palaeomaps to assess whether particular divergence events could be correlated with certain palaeogeographical or palaeoenvironmental changes. The combination of these two information sources has resulted in a much-improved understanding of mammalian evolution in island SE Asia. Using this model it is now possible to relate important palaeoenvironmental events, such as the Late Miocene cooling, an Early&#8211;Middle Pliocene highstand, or the emergence and submergence of a land bridge between the Malay Peninsula and Java to evolutionary changes in species. I test the accuracy of the new model by analysing the relationships within several mammal groups using craniometric and molecular analysis. The observed relationships and deduced timing of divergence between taxa could in many cases be explained by the model, which indicates that it is relatively accurate. In addition, with the new model I have been able to find solutions to most mammalian riddles, although these results require further testing. Overall, I therefore believe I have made a significant contribution to the biogeographical understanding of island SE Asia.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biogeography</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Sundaland</field><field name="subject">mammal</field><field name="subject">phylogeny</field><field name="subject">palaeoenvironment</field><field name="subject">vicariance</field><field name="subject">speciation</field><field name="subject">distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050924.221423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Eosinophils in the Regulation of CD4+ T helper 2 Regulated Inflammation</field><field name="creator">MacKenzie, Jason Roderick</field><field name="description">The eosinophil is a leukocyte whose intracellular mediators are considered to play a
central role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, including allergic asthma, allergic
rhinitis and atopic dermatitis, and which is also involved in immunological responses to
parasites. Eosinophil differentiation and maturation from bone marrow progenitors is
regulated by interleukin-5 (IL-5), which may be secreted by T helper 2 (Th2) T
lymphocytes, and is consistently upregulated in allergic conditions. Eotaxin is a potent
chemoattractant for circulating and tissue eosinophils, and the production of this
chemokine promotes eosinophil infiltration and accumulation within sites of allergic
inflammation.&#182;
Eosinophils obtained from inflammatory tissues and secretions display an altered
phenotype in comparison to peripheral blood eosinophils, with increased surface
expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins and adhesion
molecules (Hansel et al., 1991), and migration across the microvascular endothelium
may also increase their capacity to generate an oxidative burst (Walker et al., 1993;
Yamamoto et al., 2000). Eosinophils are phagocytic cells, and have been shown to
present simple (no requirement for intracellular processing) and complex antigens to
MHC-restricted, antigen-specific T lymphocytes (Del Pozo et al., 1992; Weller et al.,
1993). Furthermore, eosinophils express the costimulatory molecules required for
effective antigen presentation (Tamura et al., 1996), and ligation of costimulatory
molecules on the eosinophil cell surface can induce the release of eosinophil derived
cytokines (Woerly et al., 1999; Woerly et al., 2002). Therefore the eosinophil may also
regulate immune responses.&#182;
To date, no studies have demonstrated the ability of eosinophils to modulate activated T
lymphocyte function via presentation of relevant antigen in the context of MHC class II
(MHC-II), concomitant with Th2 cytokine release. In the experiments described in this
thesis, murine eosinophils have been observed to rapidly migrate to sites of antigen
deposition within the airways mucosa of na&#239;ve mice, suggesting a potential role for this
granulocyte in the primary response to inhaled antigen. However, human allergic
diseases are often diagnosed after the establishment of allergic responses, and symptom
development. Therefore, a murine model of allergic airways disease (AAD) was used to
investigate the ability for eosinophils to participate as antigen presenting cells (APCs),
and thereby modulate activated T lymphocyte function both in vitro and in vivo.
Detailed histological analysis of the pulmonary draining lymph nodes following antigen
challenge in sensitised mice revealed a rapid infiltration of eosinophils into this tissue,
which preceded the accumulation of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF). This suggested that eosinophils were preferentially translocating to the
draining lymph nodes following antigen challenge, and that the subsequent
accumulation of these cells in the BALF was a consequence of continued antigen
delivery to the lower airways.&#182;
Eosinophil trafficking to lymphoid tissue via the afferent lymphatics was substantiated
using electron microscopy of lymph node sections and the intravenous (i.v.) transfer of
fluorescently labeled eosinophils, which did not traffic to lymph nodes via the blood.
During the resolution of AAD, eosinophils were noted for their persistence in the
pulmonary draining lymph nodes. These observations suggested a continued modulation
of T cell function by lymph node dwelling eosinophils during AAD resolution,
particularly in light of recent observations for draining lymph node T cell proliferation
following instillation of antigen-pulsed eosinophils into the allergic mouse lung (Shi et
al., 2000).&#182;
To further investigate the antigen presenting capacity, eosinophils were obtained from
the BALF of mice with AAD, and their surface expression of MHC class II (MHC-II)
proteins and costimulatory molecules confirmed using flow cytometric analysis. The
ability to acquire and process complex antigen both in vitro and in vivo was also
confirmed using naturally quenching fluorescenated ovalbumin (OVA), which is
degraded into fluorescent peptides by the action of intracellular proteases. Thus,
eosinophil expression of the surface molecules necessary for effective antigen
presentation was confirmed, as was their ability to process complex antigen. Further
investigations revealed that eosinophils can present complex OVA antigen to CD4+ T
lymphocytes obtained from the allergic mouse, and to in vitro derived OVA-specific
Th2 cells. In the presence of exogenous antigen, eosinophils co-cultured with T
lymphocytes were able to induce Th2 cytokine production, and demonstrated an ability
for eosinophils to modulate T lymphocyte function in vitro.&#182;
The ability for eosinophils to act as antigen presenting cells in vivo was also
investigated. Eosinophils obtained from the antigen-saturated lungs of OVA sensitised
and challenged mice were transferred to the peritoneal cavities of na&#239;ve host mice.
When subsequently challenged with aerosolised OVA, eosinophil recipients developed
a pulmonary eosinophilia similar to that of OVA sensitised and challenged mice. To
validate this finding, the experimental procedure was altered to accommodate the use of
non-allergy derived eosinophils, which were pulsed with OVA in vitro, prior to transfer
into na&#239;ve recipients. When subsequently challenged with aerosolised OVA, eosinophil
recipients developed a peripheral blood and pulmonary eosinophilia, and stimulation
with OVA induced IL-5 and IL-13 cytokine production from pulmonary draining lymph
node cells. Notably, the AAD induced by transfer of antigen pulsed eosinophils did not
induce detectable OVA-specific IgG1, which may be attributed to the lack of soluble
antigen required for B cell antibody production.&#182;
During the course of these investigations, an OVA T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic
mouse (OT-II) was procured with a view to defining the interaction between eosinophils
and activated T lymphocytes (Barnden et al., 1998). Despite having specificity for the
OVA323-339 peptide, an immunodominant epitope that skews na&#239;ve T cell responses
towards Th2 cytokine release (Janssen et al., 2000), T lymphocytes from the OT-II
mouse preferentially secreted IFN-&#947; in response to stimulation with either OVA peptide
or OVA. These mice were further characterised in a mouse model of AAD, and found to
be refractory to disease induction and progression, which may be attributed to
significant IFN-&#947; secretion by transgenic CD4+ T lymphocytes during antigen
sensitisation. Indeed, these cells were noted for their ability to attenuate pulmonary
eosinophilia when transferred to OVA sensitised and challenged wild type mice,
although serum OVA-specific IgG1, peripheral blood eosinophilia levels and airways
response to methacholine challenge remained intact.&#182;
Knowledge of the biased Th1 phenotype in na&#239;ve OT-II provided a unique opportunity
to investigate the fate of T lymphocytes bearing high affinity OVA-specific TCRs
following neonatal antigen exposure to soluble OVA. In a previous study, subcutaneous
(s.c.) administration of soluble OVA to wild type neonatal mice was suspected to have
deleted OVA-specific T cells from the T cell repertoire (Hogan et al., 1998a). Using
flow cytometry and TCR specific antibody, the delivery of s.c. OVA to OT-II neonates did not alter transgenic T cell populations in adult mice. Instead, it was surprising to
find a skewing towards the Th2 phenotype and loss of IFN-&#947; secretion following OVA
sensitisation and challenge in adult mice. A mechanism for this reprogramming of the
transgenic T cell from the Th1 to a Th2 phenotype following OT-II neonatal exposure
to soluble OVA is proposed, and further experimentation may validate this hypothesis.&#182;
In conclusion, eosinophils residing in the allergic lung have the capacity to interact with
activated T cells, both within this tissue and the draining lymph nodes. Despite their
relative inefficiency as antigen presenting cells (Mawhorter et al., 1994), eosinophils
may participate en masse in the serial triggering of activated TCRs, and provide
appropriate costimulatory signals that modulate T lymphocyte function. Through the
elaboration of Th2 cytokines and stimulation of T cell proliferation, antigen presenting
eosinophils may transiently prolong or exacerbate the symptoms of allergic diseases.
Alternatively, eosinophils presenting relevant antigens may inhibit T cell activity via
degranulation, and such activity has recently been observed in a parasite model (Shinkai
et al., 2002). Finally, experiments in the OT-II mouse have provided valuable
information to suggest that therapies designed to modulate eosinophil numbers in
allergic tissues through the secretion of opposing cytokines such as IFN-&#947;, may be of
limited benefit. The results shown here suggest that airways dysfunction remains intact

In this context, it predominantly investigates the role of defects in limiting the luminescence of Si nanocrystals, and the removal of these defects by hydrogen passivation.  The kinetics of the defect passivation process, for both molecular and atomic hydrogen, are studied in detail. Moreover, the optical absorption of Si nanocrystals and the effect of annealing environment (during nanocrystal synthesis) on the luminescence are investigated.  The effect of annealing temperature and hydrogen passivation on the coupling (energy transfer) of Si nanocrystals to optically active centres (Er) is also examined.&#182;

The electronic structure of silicon-implanted silica slides is investigated through optical absorption measurements. Before and after annealing to form Si nanocrystals, optical absorption spectra from these samples show considerable structure that is characteristic of the particular implant fluence. This structure is shown to correlate with the transmittance of the samples as calculated from the modified refractive index profile for each implant. Due to the high absorption coefficient of Si at short wavelengths, extinction at these wavelengths is found to be dominated by absorption. As such, scattering losses are surprisingly insignificant.
To eliminate interference effects, photothermal deflection spectroscopy is used to obtain data on the band structure of Si in these samples. This data shows little variance from bulk Si
structure and thus little effect of quantum confinement. This is attributed to the dominance of
large nanocrystals in the absorption measurements.&#182;

The effect of annealing environment on the photoluminescence (PL) from silicon nanocrystals synthesized in fused silica by ion implantation and thermal annealing is studied as a function of annealing temperature and time. Interestingly, the choice of annealing environment (Ar, N2, or 5 % H2 in N2) is found to affect the shape and intensity of luminescence emission
spectra, an effect that is attributed both to variations in nanocrystal size and the density of defect states at the nanocrystal/oxide interface.&#182;

The passivation kinetics of luminescence-quenching defects, associated with Si nanocrystals in SiO2, during isothermal and isochronal annealing in molecular hydrogen are studied by time-resolved PL. The passivation of these defects is modeled using the Generalized Simple
Thermal model of simultaneous passivation and desorption, proposed by Stesmans. Values for the reaction-rate parameters are determined for the first time and found to be in excellent
agreement with values previously determined for paramagnetic Si dangling-bond defects (Pb type centers) found at planar Si/SiO2 interfaces; supporting the view that non-radiative recombination in Si nanocrystals is dominated by such defects.&#182;

The passivation kinetics of luminescence-quenching defects during isothermal and isochronal annealing in atomic hydrogen are studied by continuous and time-resolved PL. The kinetics are compared to those for standard passivation in molecular hydrogen and found to be
significantly different. Atomic hydrogen is generated using the alneal process, through reactions between a deposited Al layer and H2O or &#150;OH radicals in the SiO2. The passivation and desorption kinetics are shown to be consistent with the existence of two classes of nonradiative defects: one that reacts with both atomic and molecular hydrogen, and the other that reacts only with atomic hydrogen. A model incorporating a Gaussian spread in activation energies is presented that adequately describes the kinetics of atomic hydrogen passivation and dissociation for the samples.&#182;

The effect of annealing temperature and hydrogen passivation on the excitation cross-section and PL of erbium in silicon-rich silica is studied. Samples are prepared by co-implantation of Si and Er into SiO2 followed by a single thermal anneal at temperatures ranging from 800 to
1100 degrees C, and with or without hydrogen passivation performed at 500 degrees C. Using time-resolved PL, the effective erbium excitation cross-section is shown to increase by a factor of 3, while the number of optically active erbium ions decreases by a factor of 4 with increasing annealing temperature. Hydrogen passivation is shown to increase the luminescence intensity
and to shorten the luminescence lifetime at 1.54 micron only in the presence of Si nanocrystals.  The implications of these results for realizing a silicon-based optical amplifier are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">silicon nanocrystals</field><field name="subject">hydrogen passivation</field><field name="subject">quantum dots</field><field name="subject">photoluminescence</field><field name="subject">photonics</field><field name="subject">ion implantation</field><field name="subject">erbium</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060202.111537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SHYSTER: A Pragmatic Legal Expert System</field><field name="creator">Popple, James David</field><field name="description">Most legal expert systems attempt to implement complex models of legal reasoning. Yet the utility of a legal expert system lies not in the extent to which it simulates a lawyer's approach to a legal problem, but in the quality of its predictions and of its arguments. A complex model of legal reasoning is not necessary: a successful legal expert system can be based upon a simplified model of legal reasoning. &#182;
Some researchers have based their systems upon a jurisprudential approach to the law, yet lawyers are patently able to operate without any jurisprudential insight. A useful legal expert system should be capable of producing advice similar to that which one might get from a lawyer, so it should operate at the same pragmatic level of abstraction as does a lawyer - not at the more philosophical level of jurisprudence. &#182;
A legal expert system called SHYSTER has been developed to demonstrate that a useful legal expert system can be based upon a pragmatic approach to the law. SHYSTER has a simple representation structure which simplifies the problem of knowledge acquisition. Yet this structure is complex enough for SHYSTER to produce useful advice. &#182;
SHYSTER is a case-based legal expert system (although it has been designed so that it can be linked with a rule-based system to form a hybrid legal expert system). Its advice is based upon an examination of, and an argument about, the similarities and differences between cases. SHYSTER attempts to model the way in which lawyers argue with cases, but it does not attempt to model the way in which lawyers decide which cases to use in those arguments. Instead, it employs statistical techniques to quantify the similarity between cases. It decides which cases to use in argument, and what prediction it will make, on the basis of that similarity measure. &#182;
SHYSTER is of a general design: it provides advice in areas of case law that have been specified by a legal expert using a specification language. Four different, and disparate, areas of law have been specified for SHYSTER, and its operation has been tested in each of those legal domains. &#182;
Testing of SHYSTER in these four domains indicates that it is exceptionally good at predicting results, and fairly good at choosing cases with which to construct its arguments. SHYSTER demonstrates the viability of a pragmatic approach to legal expert system design.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SHYSTER</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">legal</field><field name="subject">expert system</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">jurisprudence</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20020609.233848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Giant Planets and Variable Stars in Globular Clusters</field><field name="creator">Weldrake, David Thomas Fredrick</field><field name="description">Over the last decade, 135 extrasolar planets have been discovered, the vast majority found by ongoing radial velocity searches. Of the stars sampled in these searches, 1% have `Hot Jupiter' planets associated with them. Having masses equivalent to Jupiter yet orbital periods of only a few days, this new class of planet is clearly unlike anything in our Solar System.&#182;

Hot Jupiters present us with an intriguing prospect. If the orientation of the planetary orbit is close to edge-on, the planet will periodically transit across the face of its star, resulting in a small drop in brightness. This transit phenomenon has been successfully used for planet detection over the last couple of years, allowing determination of the planetary radius and accurate mass estimates when coupled with radial velocity observations.&#182;

To aid understanding of the effect stellar environment plays on Hot Jupiter formation and survivability, this thesis presents the results of a wide-field search for transiting Hot Jupiters in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. This cluster presents many thousands of stars in a moderate field of view and provides the perfect target for a search of this nature. One previous transit search has been made in the central core of 47 Tuc; using the HST for 8.3 continuous days, Gilliland et.al (2000) expected 17 transits yet found none. This null result suggests that either system metallicity or stellar density may be inhibiting Hot Jupiter formation or survivability in the cluster.&#182;

This thesis presents a search for transits with a field of view 250 times larger than the HST search and samples the uncrowded outer halo of the cluster (previously unsampled for transits), providing important constraints on the effect of environment on Hot Jupiter formation. If planets are found, then stellar density would seem responsible for the Gilliland et.al (2000) core null result. If no planets are found to a significant level, the survey would provide strong evidence that system metallicity is the dominant factor. Using the ANU 40'' (1m) telescope at Siding Spring Observatory, a 30.4 night observing run was executed and photometry was derived via differential imaging. The dataset numbers 109,000 cluster (and field) stars for photometric analysis, of which 22,000 are suitable for the transit search. With a custom-written transit detection algorithm and extensive Monte Carlo simulations to model the dataset, seven planets should be detectable if the occurrence rate of Hot Jupiters is the same in the cluster as in the Solar Neighbourhood.&#182;

Despite a detailed search, no transit signatures were identified. This result strongly indicates that the low metallicity of the cluster is the dominant factor inhibiting planet formation in 47 Tuc. Current results in the Solar Neighbourhood show that planet frequency is strongly biased towards stars of high metallicity. This thesis shows that the metallicity trend is likely a universal phenomenon, not only limited to the immediate Solar Neighbourhood and raises questions of whether planets were much rarer in the earlier Universe.&#182;

As a side result of the search, 100 variable stars were identified in the field, 69 of which are new discoveries. Subsequent analysis reveals a strong period segregation among the cluster eclipsing binaries, indicating previously unobserved dynamical effects in the cluster. Distance estimates for both 47 Tuc and the SMC are in agreement with previously published values and an independent identification of the binary period-colour relation was observed. Two binaries seem to have low-luminosity companions worthy of followup and one variable is likely a star in the early phases of planetary nebula formation. All of the results presented in this thesis have been published in three separately refereed research papers.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">planets</field><field name="subject">globular clusters</field><field name="subject">47Tuc</field><field name="subject">variable stars</field><field name="subject">transits</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050616.191315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tidal Structure in Galactic Satellites</field><field name="creator">Coleman, Matthew Grant</field><field name="description">The dynamical histories of three Galactic satellite systems have been investigated.  These include the Fornax and Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and the globular cluster Omega Centauri.  Wide-field CCD photometry was obtained for these objects in two colours, V and I, covering a total sky area of 30 square degrees.  These data were used to construct a colour-magnitude diagram for each system, which then provided a filter to select probable member stars.  This technique reduced contamination from foreground stars, allowing a comprehensive examination of the poorly-known outer regions of these three Galactic satellites.&#182;

An initial analysis of the central region of Fornax was made using the deep photometric data provided by Stetson et al.  The analysis revealed a shell-like feature located approximately 1.5 core radii southeast from the centre of the dwarf galaxy, with an integrated luminosity of M_V ~ -4.  The colour-magnitude data for this shell indicate it to be dominated by stars with an age ~2 Gyr.&#182;

The complete analysis of Fornax utilised two colour data covering a 3.2 deg times 3.2 deg area on the sky.  The colour-magnitude selection technique revealed a second shell-like feature situated 1.3 deg northwest from the Fornax centre, approximately 30' beyond the nominal tidal radius at this position angle.  This feature displays an integrated luminosity of M_V ~ -7.  The alignment of this second shell is parallel to the original shell, and both are situated on the minor axis.  Additionally, a statistical analysis of the extra-tidal region of Fornax revealed two large, faint surface brightness structures located on the minor axis.  These structures, combined with the two shells, present strong evidence for shell structure in Fornax.  This is the first such structure observed in a dwarf galaxy, and implies that Fornax has experienced a merger event in the recent past.&#182;

The photometric survey of Sculptor was complete to the depth of the horizontal branch stars.  The red horizontal branch stars were found to be significantly more concentrated than the blue horizontal branch stars.  An analysis of the distribution of red giant branch-selected stars revealed no significant extra-tidal structure.  To further test this result, spectra at far red wavelengths were obtained for over 700 candidate red giant stars over the 10 sq deg region using the 2dF instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope.  Radial velocities and metallicities for these stars were measured using Ca ii triplet lines, providing additional constraints to select Sculptor members beyond the nominal tidal radius.  The distribution of the 179 probable Sculptor members indicated a lack of extra-tidal stars.  These results support, at most, a mild level of interaction between this system and the Galaxy.  An upper mass limit for extra-tidal material was measured to be 10% of the Sculptor luminous mass.&#182;

The analysis of Omega Centauri was similar to that of Sculptor.  V and I band photometry was obtained to search for the tidal tails proposed by a previous study.  As noted by others, dust correction was found to remove these structures.  Spectra covering the region 370-450 nm were obtained for approximately 4000 candidate cluster members, and radial velocities were used to distinguish members from field stars.  A total of 24 probable members of Omega Cen were found in the extra-tidal regions.  Hence, if Omega Cen does possess tidal tails, they comprise at most 1% of the cluster mass.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fornax dwarf galaxySculptor dwarf galaxyOmega CentauriTidal structure</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20050602.112738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond fragmentation :
Lizard distribution patterns in two production landscapes and their implications for conceptual landscape models</field><field name="creator">Fischer, Joern</field><field name="description">Fauna conservation outside protected areas can make an important complementary contribution to conservation within reserves. This thesis aimed to contribute new information and analytical frameworks to the science of fauna conservation in human-modified landscapes. Two approaches were used: (1) empirical data collection and analysis, and (2) the discussion and development of conceptual landscape models.
&#182;
Empirical work focused on lizard distribution patterns in two production landscapes in southeastern Australia. Lizards were targeted because ectotherms are frequently neglected by conservation biologists. The &#147;Nanangroe grazing landscape&#148; was used for sheep and cattle grazing. In this landscape, approximately 85% of pre-European woodland cover had been cleared, and understorey vegetation was sparse. Lizards were surveyed at 16 landscape units, which were stratified by aspect, topographic position and amount of tree cover. Each landscape unit contained three sites, and each site contained three plots. Regression modelling showed that different species responded differently to their environment. For example, the four-fingered skink (Carlia tetradactyla) and Boulenger&#146;s skink (Morethia boulengeri) were more likely to occur at woodland sites with northerly aspects, whereas the striped skink (Ctenotus robustus) and olive legless lizard (Delma inornata) were more likely to inhabit sites with a simple microhabitat structure. Statistical analysis further showed that the habitat attributes that lizards were related to varied continuously through space, and over different spatial scales. For example, invertebrate abundance (a proxy for food availability) varied most strongly over tens of metres, whereas the amount of grass cover varied most strongly over hundreds to thousands of metres. Thus, work at Nanangroe revealed spatially complex patterns of lizard occurrence and habitat variables.
&#182;
The &#147;Tumut plantation landscape&#148; was a spatial mosaic of native eucalypt (Eucalyptus) forest patches embedded within a plantation of the introduced radiata pine (Pinus radiata). In this landscape, thirty sites were surveyed for lizards. Sites were stratified by forest type and patch size, and included eucalypt patches, pine sites, and extensive areas of eucalypt forest adjacent to the plantation. Regression modelling showed that lizard species responded to various habitat attributes, including elevation, the amount of eucalypt forest within 1 km of a site, invertebrate abundance and ground cover. Variables related to habitat fragmentation often were significant predictors of lizard occurrence. However, work at Tumut suggested that important additional insights into lizard distribution patterns could be obtained by considering variables related to food and shelter resources, and climatic conditions.
&#182;
The Nanangroe and Tumut landscapes were in close proximity, but together spanned an altitudinal gradient of 900 m. An investigation of changes in lizard community composition with altitude showed that (1) only one species was common to Nanangroe and Tumut, (2) different species had different altitudinal preferences, and (3) ecologically similar species replaced one another with increasing altitude. These results highlighted that even in highly modified landscapes, natural gradients (such as climate) can play an important role in shaping animal assemblage composition and species distribution patterns.
&#182;
Empirical work suggested that, in some landscapes, the frequently used &#147;fragmentation model&#148; is a relatively weak conceptual basis for the study of animal distribution patterns. The fragmentation model implicitly assumes that &#147;habitat patches&#148; can be defined unequivocally across many species, and that patches are located within a relatively inhospitable matrix. Where these assumptions are breached, conservation guidelines arising from the fragmentation model may be too simplified. In spatially complex production landscapes, it may be more appropriate to maintain habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales than to focus solely on the management of large, pre-defined patches.
&#182;
Given the potential limitations of the fragmentation model, a new, more holistic landscape model was developed. The &#147;continuum model&#148; was derived from continuum theory as developed for plant ecology. The continuum model recognises (1) spatial continua of environmental variables, and (2) species&#146; individualistic responses to these variables. For animals, key environmental variables may be related to the availability of food, shelter, sufficient space, and suitable climatic conditions. Unlike the fragmentation model, the continuum model is inherently process-based and thus may help to link the perceived gap between patterns and processes in landscape ecology.
&#182;
Three general conclusions arise from this thesis:
1. Some heterogeneous production landscapes support many native species, and therefore represent important conservation opportunities.
2. In some modified landscapes, the fragmentation model does not capture the complexity of animal distribution patterns. In those landscapes, conservation recommendations derived from the fragmentation model may be overly simplistic.
3. The continuum model may be a useful extension of the fragmentation model. It provides a process-based conceptual basis for empirical work on animal distribution patterns.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">landscape ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">human-modified landscapes</field><field name="subject">conceptual landscape models</field><field name="subject">production landscapes</field><field name="subject">lizards</field><field name="subject">lizard distribution patterns</field><field name="subject">southeastern Australia</field><field name="subject">Nanangroe</field><field name="subject">Tumut</field><field name="subject">grazing</field><field name="subject">plantation</field><field name="subject">fragmentation</field><field name="subject">continuum model</field><field name="subject">variegated landscape</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060718.150101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pattern of memory and perceptual dysfunctions in recreational ecstasy users</field><field name="creator">Brown, John Anthony</field><field name="description">There is a growing body of evidence that the main psychoactive ingredient of the recreational drug &#147;ecstasy&#148; (methylendioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) causes lasting changes to the serotonin system in both animals and humans, including the hippocampus (involved in memory) and the occipital lobe (involved in visual perception). Previous studies have often found memory deficits in ecstasy users. However, the results have been far from consistent across studies. None of the methods used to date have adequately isolated the hippocampal component of memory from the contribution of other brain regions. Three memory studies were conducted in this thesis to clarify which components and processes of memory are in deficit in ecstasy users.&#182;
In the first memory study, ecstasy users (n=32) did not differ from non-drug using controls (n=29) on implicit memory (automatic non-conscious retrieval, as revealed by a stem-completion task), or explicit memory (conscious recollection, as revealed by stem-cued recall). In the second memory study, no significant differences were found between ecstasy users (n=30) and non-drug using controls (n=34) on tests designed to clarify the findings on explicit memory, or on two standard neuropsychological tests of long-term memory (prose recall and Auditory Verbal Learning Test) that allowed greater use of elaborative processing at study. In the third memory study, a number of tests were applied that differed in their elaborative processing demands, including the California Verbal Learning Test, Visual Paired Associates, and Verbal Paired Associates. Ecstasy users (n=32) had poorer recall, and made less strategic use of elaborative processing compared to both cannabis-using controls (n=33) and non-drug using controls (n=33). Also, on a novel test of elaborative processing (&#147;Verbal Triplet Associates&#148;), both cannabis users and ecstasy users had memory deficits on the first trial, but only ecstasy users had a significant learning deficit over successive trials. On the basis of the localisation of the components and processes of memory in literature, it was concluded that long-term memory deficits in ecstasy users may reflect changes in elaborative processes localised in the frontal lobes, or global deficits, rather than just changes to the memory functions of the hippocampus.&#182;
With regard to visual perception, no studies have been published to date that have examined MDMA-related changes to the behavioural functioning of the occipital lobe in humans. In the current thesis, this was investigated using the tilt aftereffect illusion. In accordance with expectations, ecstasy users had a larger tilt aftereffect compared to non-drug using controls (n=34). Unexpectedly, this result was only obtained for a subset of 12 ecstasy users (out of n=30) who had not used amphetamines in the recent past. It was concluded that the results for ecstasy users who had not recently used amphetamines were consistent with the proposal that ecstasy-related serotonergic changes in the occipital lobe broaden the tuning bandwidth of orientation sensitive neurons, and that the recent use of amphetamines appears to counteract that effect.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecstacy</field><field name="subject">MDMA</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060407.155643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power and participation:
participatory resource management
in south-west Queensland</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Dana</field><field name="description">To develop a sustainable future for the rangelands, partnerships are needed &#151; partnerships between scientists, policy makers, visitors, and most significantly, the various communities of people who live and work in the rangelands. The views of these people are as variable as the country about which they care; rangeland communities are not homogeneous. The power relations between these people are at the base of many conflicts. How we handle the relationships between these groups, and manage these conflicts, are crucial for success in land management. 
&#182;
The first part of this thesis reviews the history of both community participation and power theory. While participatory approaches are part of the rhetoric in Australian land management, proponents are generally na&#239;ve about the complexities of power and power relations. The philosophical literature highlights that power is a contested concept; and these divisions are epitomised by the works of Habermas and Foucault. Their writings are compared and contrasted to provide a rich understanding of power relations in community participation. 
&#182;
Power relations influence whose voices are heard: those who exercise power, and the sets of rules that define what is seen as true or false at any given time in history. Power relations also determine whose knowledge is incorporated in land management policy and practice. The model proposed in this thesis demonstrates that power relations interact with every dimension of community participation: context, goals, scale, stage, who is involved, the capacity of those involved, and the methods used.

Research was undertaken within agricultural and natural resource management programs and projects in south-west Queensland. A variety of participatory approaches are used by government agencies to encourage grazier participation and the adoption of more sustainable practices, such as Landcare, Bestprac and the regional groups, such as the South West Strategy. While government staff in south-west Queensland purport to share decision-making power with landholders, landholders tend to have different perspectives about the level of power that is being shared. 
&#182;
One of the key findings of this research is that power is not static within any project. Rather, power is ultradynamic, fluid, and highly dependent on context. In terms of land management programs, the levels of power sharing fluctuate over time and between actors. The micro-physics of power, or the power relations among individuals, are often invisible to, or neglected by, the facilitators of land management programs. 
&#182;
Government agencies tend to focus on the processes used, and on finding the best participatory methods, rather than on the individuals who implement the process or the individuals who participate. Greater flexibility is needed in approaches to land management; correspondingly, greater responsibility is needed from all individuals who have a stake in it. To find sustainable solutions for the rangelands and its people, all involved in participatory land management projects need to better understand the dynamics of power, so as to manage any negative effects.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">participatory resource management</field><field name="subject">land management</field><field name="subject">south-west Queensland</field><field name="subject">rangelands</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="subject">engagement</field><field name="subject">consultation</field><field name="subject">NRM</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060912.165641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EXPERIMENTS WITH A METASTABLE HELIUM

Reverberation poses a major challenge to acoustic signal processing problems. It degrades speech intelligibility and causes many acoustic algorithms that process sound to perform poorly. Current solutions to the reverberation problem frequently only work in lightly reverberant environments.  There is need to improve the reverberant performance of acoustic algorithms.&#182;

The approach of this thesis is to explore how the intrinsic properties of reverberation can be exploited to improve acoustic signal processing algorithms. A general approach to soundfield modelling using statistical room acoustics is applied to analyze the reverberant performance of several acoustic algorithms. A model of the underlying structure of reverberation is incorporated to create a new method
of soundfield reproduction.&#182;

Several outcomes resulting from this approach are: (i) a study of how more sound capture with directional microphones and beamformers can improve the robustness of acoustic equalization, (ii) an assessment of the extent to which source tracking can improve accuracy of source localization, (iii) a new method of soundfield reproduction for reverberant rooms, based upon a parametrization of the acoustic transfer function and (iv) a study of beamforming to directional sources, specifically exploiting the directionality of human speech.&#182;  

The approach to soundfield modelling has permitted a study of algorithm performance on important parameters of the room acoustics and the algorithm design.  The performance of acoustic equalization and source tracking have been found to depend not only on the levels of reverberation but also on the correlation of pressure between points in reverberant soundfields. This correlation can be increased by sound capture with directional capture devices. Work on soundfield reproduction has shown that, though reverberation significantly degrades the performance of conventional techniques, by accounting for the reverberation it is possible to design reproduction methods that function well in reverberant environments.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soundfield reproduction</field><field name="subject">acoustic equalization</field><field name="subject">beamforming</field><field name="subject">reverberation</field><field name="subject">signal processing</field><field name="subject">spatial correlation</field><field name="subject">acoustic transfer function</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20051129.121453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minimising the Decoherence
of Rare Earth Ion
Solid State Spin Qubits</field><field name="creator">Fraval, Elliot</field><field name="description">[Mathematical symbols can be only approximated here. For the correct
display see the Abstract in the PDF files linked below] This work has
demonstrated that hyperfine decoherence times sufficiently long for
QIP and quantum optics applications are achievable in rare earth ion
centres. Prior to this work there were several QIP proposals using
rare earth hyperfine states for long term coherent storage of optical
interactions [1, 2, 3]. The very long T_1 (~weeks [4]) observed for
rare-earth hyperfine transitions appears promising but hyperfine T_2s
were only a few ms, comparable to rare earth optical transitions and
therefore the usefulness of such proposals was doubtful.
&#182;
This work demonstrated an increase in hyperfine T_2 by a factor of 7 &#215;
10^4 compared to the previously reported hyperfine T_2 for
Pr^[3+]:Y_2SiO_5 through the application of static and dynamic
magnetic field techniques. This increase in T_2 makes previous QIP
proposals useful and provides the first solid state optically active
Lamda system with very long hyperfine T_2 for quantum optics
applications.
&#182;
The first technique employed the conventional wisdom of applying a
small static magnetic field to minimise the superhyperfine interaction
[5, 6, 7], as studied in chapter 4. This resulted in hyperfine
transition T_2 an order of magnitude larger than the T_2 of optical
transitions, ranging fro 5 to 10 ms. The increase in T_2 was not
sufficient and consequently other approaches were required.
&#182;
Development of the critical point technique during this work was
crucial to achieving further gains in T_2. The critical point
technique is the application of a static magnetic field such that the
Zeeman shift of the hyperfine transition of interest has no first
order component, thereby nulling decohering magnetic interactions to
first order. This technique also represents a global minimum for back
action of the Y spin bath due to a change in the Pr spin state,
allowing the assumption that the Pr ion is surrounded by a thermal
bath. The critical point technique resulted in a dramatic increase of
the hyperfine transition T_2 from ~10 ms to 860 ms.
&#182;
Satisfied that the optimal static magnetic field configuration for
increasing T_2 had been achieved, dynamic magnetic field techniques,
driving either the system of interest or spin bath were investigated.
These techniques are broadly classed as Dynamic Decoherence Control
(DDC) in the QIP community. The first DDC technique investigated was
driving the Pr ion using a CPMG or Bang Bang decoupling pulse
sequence. This significantly extended T_2 from 0.86 s to 70 s. This
decoupling strategy has been extensively discussed for correcting
phase errors in quantum computers [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], with
this work being the first application to solid state systems.
&#182;
Magic Angle Line Narrowing was used to investigate driving the spin
bath to increase T_2. This experiment resulted in T_2 increasing from
0.84 s to 1.12 s. Both dynamic techniques introduce a periodic
condition on when QIP operation can be performed without the qubits
participating in the operation accumulating phase errors relative to
the qubits not involved in the operation.
&#182;
Without using the critical point technique Dynamic Decoherence Control
techniques such as the Bang Bang decoupling sequence and MALN are not
useful due to the sensitivity of the Pr ion to magnetic field
fluctuations. Critical point and DDC techniques are mutually
beneficial since the critical point is most effective at removing high
frequency perturbations while DDC techniques remove the low frequency
perturbations. A further benefit of using the critical point technique
is it allows changing the coupling to the spin bath without changing
the spin bath dynamics. This was useful for discerning whether the
limits are inherent to the DDC technique or are due to experimental
limitations.
&#182;
Solid state systems exhibiting long T_2 are typically very specialised
systems, such as 29Si dopants in an isotopically pure 28Si and
therefore spin free host lattice [16]. These systems rely on on the
purity of their environment to achieve long T_2. Despite possessing a
long T_2, the spin system remain inherently sensitive to magnetic
field fluctuations. In contrast, this work has demonstrated that
decoherence times, sufficiently long to rival any solid state system
[16], are achievable when the spin of interest is surrounded by a
concentrated spin bath. Using the critical point technique results in
a hyperfine state that is inherently insensitive to small magnetic
field perturbations and therefore more robust for QIP applications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rare earth ions</field><field name="subject">decoherence</field><field name="subject">solid state qubit</field><field name="subject">spin qubit</field><field name="subject">hyperfine decoherence</field><field name="subject">hyperfine transitions</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Decoherence Control</field><field name="subject">Quantum Error Correction</field><field name="subject">quantum information processing</field><field name="subject">quantum computation</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20061010.124211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical Tweezers: Experimental Demonstrations of the Fluctuation Theorem</field><field name="creator">Carberry, David Michael</field><field name="description">In the late 19th and early 20th centuries famous scientists like Boltzmann, Loschmidt, Maxwell and Einstein tried, unsuccessfully, to find the link between the time-reversible equations of motion of individual molecules and irreversible thermodynamics.

In the decade that followed theory and computer simulation tested the FT and, in 2002, an experiment indirectly demonstrated the FT.&#182;

This thesis describes original experiments that demonstrate the FT directly using Optical Tweezers. A related expression, known as the Kawasaki Identity, is also experimentally demonstrated.

The predominantly organic sediments of Lake Wanum (alt. 35 m) span the last 9600 years. A 14C chronology supports the calculation of annual pollen deposition, sediment accumulation, and carbonised particle influx rates. At Yanamugi lake (alt. 170 m), 14C assays of the calcareous muds are influenced by variable &#145;hard- water error&#146;. A tentative chronology is based on palaeomagnetic and tephra correlations.&#182;

Pollen trapping reveals very high contemporary annual deposition rates within forest, but low values over the central lake area. Surface pollen assemblages from different habitats indicate the localised nature of pollen dispersal, although a relatively &#145;long-distance component&#146; from higher altitudes is also recognised.&#182;

Analysis of floristic data from the herbaceous swamp vegetation of Lake Wanum suggests the existence of two free floating root-mat associations and two or three rooted associations. Water depth appears the primary control on their distribution.&#182;

Holocene swamp communities analogous with extant associations may be identified in the palynological record of Lake Wanum. Swamp marginal conditions prevail from 9500 BP until 8200 BP when permanent shallow water becomes established. Rooted vegetation associations then predominate until about 5000 BP. Floating vegetation associations first become important at this time, and subsequently (3000 BP to 2000 BP) come to dominate the site. A general trend towards increased water depth is indicated throughout the sequence.&#182;

Increased representation of dry-land non-forest pollen occurs from 8550 BP, and grassland taxa become more frequent from about 5350 BP. Synchronous trends in carbonised particle influx identify fire as a probable agent of vegetation change.&#182; 

Little change in dry-land vegetation is recorded in the pollen sequence from Yanamugi, although recent encroachment by swamp vegetation occurs. The large proportion of &#145;montane&#146; pollen and spore taxa in the earlier sediments is attributed to variable fluvial influx. &#182;

Conditions at Lake Wanum until 8200 BP may reflect the early Holocene aridity widespread in equatorial areas, although the indirect hydrologic effects of rising sea level cannot be discounted. Human impact appears the main determinant of dry-land vegetation change during much of the Holocene.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paleobotany -- Holocene</field><field name="subject">Paleobotany -- Papua New Guinea -- Markham River Valley</field><field name="subject">Vegetation and climate -- Papua New Guinea -- Markham River Valley</field><field name="subject">Physical geography -- Papua New Guinea -- Markham River Valley</field><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="subject">Stratigraphic -- Holocene</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060503.112847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tomographic Visible Spectroscopy of Plasma Emissivity and Ion Temperatures</field><field name="creator">Glass, Fenton John</field><field name="description">Extending the use of Doppler spectroscopy as an important plasma diagnostic -- by developing a multi-channel system capable of tomography -- is the foundation of this thesis. A system which can simultaneously measure the emissivity, temperature and flow velocity of plasma ions has been installed, calibrated and operated on the H-1NF heliac, yielding comprehensive and interesting results. The measurements are time-resolved, made from a large range of viewing positions and, using scalar tomographic inversion methods, can be
unfolded to give two-dimensional images of ion emissivity and temperature. The flow velocity profiles, while not inverted, nevertheless lead to a greater understanding of the plasma behaviour.&#182;

Fifty-five lens-coupled optical fibres, mounted on a large rotatable stainless steel ring, encircle the plasma poloidally and transport light to a multi-channel Fourier-transform spectrometer. This
`coherence-imaging' spectrometer employs an electro-optically modulated birefringent crystal plate to monitor the coherence of an
isolated spectral line. Measurement of the intensity, fringe visibility and phase of the resulting interferogram leads to values
for the emissivity, ion temperature and flow velocity. Using a multi-anode photomultiplier assembly, allows the time-resolved detection of all optical channels simultaneously.&#182;

The system has been fully calibrated, including a measurement of the spatial response of each line-of-sight. The calibration procedure accounts for the relative channel sensitivities, the response of the line filter and the removal of detector cross-talk. In situ light sources are installed provide routine and accurate relative
intensity calibration of the system.&#182;

Methods of tomography provide the unfolding of the measured plasma
parameters to construct two-dimensional images of ion temperature and emissivity. Methods of inversion include the iterative ART routine -- using projection data gathered with the light-collecting optics rotated to different viewing positions -- and linear composition of Fourier-Bessel basis functions -- with the data obtained from a
single unrotated viewing position. ART reconstructions of the emissivity are performed without the need for a priori information while those of the ion temperature are computed using regularising functions to help stabilise the
inversion.&#182;

This new system -- named ToMOSS for Tomographic Modulated Optical
Solid-state Spectrometer -- enables a more detailed study of various plasma
phenomena observed in H-1NF. Among other results, this thesis presents the first tomographic reconstructions of emissivity and temperature fluctuations associated with a large-scale coherent instability.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">magnetically confined plasma</field><field name="subject">tomography</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">spectrometry</field><field name="subject">doppler-spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">fourier-transform spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">stellarator</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20051028.002110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy Gradient Methods: Variance Reduction and Stochastic Convergence</field><field name="creator">Greensmith, Evan</field><field name="description">In a reinforcement learning task an agent must learn a policy for performing actions so as to perform well in a given environment.  Policy gradient methods consider a parameterized class of policies, and using a policy from the class, and a trajectory through the environment taken by the agent using this policy, estimate the performance of the policy with respect to the parameters. Policy gradient methods avoid some of the problems of value function methods, such as policy degradation, where inaccuracy in the value function leads to the choice of a poor policy.  However, the estimates produced by policy gradient methods can have high variance.&#182;

In Part I of this thesis we study the estimation variance of policy gradient algorithms, in particular, when augmenting the estimate with a baseline, a common method for reducing estimation variance, and when using actor-critic methods. A baseline adjusts the reward signal supplied by the environment, and can be used to reduce the variance of a policy gradient estimate without adding any bias.  We find the baseline that minimizes the variance.  We also consider the class of constant baselines, and find the constant baseline that minimizes the variance.  We compare this to the common technique of adjusting the rewards by an estimate of the performance measure.  Actor-critic methods usually attempt to learn a value function accurate enough to be used in a gradient estimate without adding much bias.  In this thesis we propose that in learning the value function we should also consider the variance.  We show how considering the variance of the gradient estimate when learning a value function can be beneficial, and we introduce a new optimization criterion for selecting a value function.&#182;

In Part II of this thesis we consider online versions of policy gradient algorithms, where we update our policy for selecting actions at each step in time, and study the convergence of the these online algorithms.  For such online gradient-based algorithms, convergence results aim to show that the gradient of the performance measure approaches zero.  Such a result has been shown for an algorithm which is based on observing trajectories between visits to a special state of the environment.  However, the algorithm is not suitable in a partially observable setting, where we are unable to access the full state of the environment, and its variance depends on the time between visits to the special state, which may be large even when only few samples are needed to estimate the gradient.  To date, convergence results for algorithms that do not rely on a special state are weaker.  We show that, for a certain algorithm that does not rely on a special state, the gradient of the performance measure approaches zero.  We show that this continues to hold when using certain baseline algorithms suggested by the results of Part I.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reinforcement learning</field><field name="subject">policy gradient</field><field name="subject">stochastic convergence</field><field name="subject">variance reduction</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060106.193712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and demonstration of a diode laser sensor for a scramjet combustor</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, Alan David</field><field name="description">Hypersonic vehicles, based on scramjet engines, have the potential to deliver inexpensive access to space when compared with rocket propulsion.   The technology, however, is in its infancy and there is still much to be learned from fundamental studies.&#182;

Flows that represent the conditions inside a scramjet engine can be generated in ground tests using a free-piston shock tunnel and a combustor model. These facilities provide a convenient location for fundamental studies and principles learned during ground tests can be applied to the design of a full-scale vehicle.&#182;

A wide range of diagnostics have been used for studying scramjet flows, including surface measurements and optical visualisation techniques.&#182;

The aim of this work is to test the effectiveness of tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) as a scramjet diagnostic.&#182;

TDLAS utilises the spectrally narrow emission from a diode laser to probe individual
absorption lines of a target species. By varying the diode laser injection
current, the laser emission wavelength can be scanned to rapidly obtain a profile of the spectral line. TDLAS has been used previously for gas-dynamic sensing applications and, in the configuration used in this work, is sensitive to
temperature and water vapour concentration.&#182;

The design of the sensor was guided by previous work. It incorporated aspects of designs that were considered to be well suited to the present application.  Aspects of the design which were guided by the literature included the laser emission wavelength, the use of fibre optics and the detector used. The laser emission wavelength was near 1390 nm to coincide with relatively strong water vapour transitions. This wavelength allowed the use of telecommunications optical fibre and components for light delivery. Detection used a dual-beam, noise cancelling detector.&#182;

The sensor was validated before deployment in a low-pressure test cell and a hydrogen&#150;air flame. Temperature and water concentration measurements were verified to within 5% up to 1550 K. Verification accuracy was limited by non-uniformity along the beam path during flame measurements.&#182;

Measurements were made in a scramjet combustor operating in a flow generated by the T3 shock tunnel at the Australian National University. Within the scramjet combustor, hydrogen was injected into a flame-holding cavity and the sensor was operated downstream in the expanded, supersonic, post-combustion flow. The sensor was operated at a maximum repetition rate of 20 kHz and
could resolve variation in temperature and water concentration over the 3ms running time of the facility.&#182;

Results were repeatable and the measurement uncertainty was smaller than the turbulent fluctuations in the flow. The scramjet was operated at two fuel-lean equivalence ratios and the sensor was able to show differences  between the two operating conditions. In addition, vertical traversal of the sensor revealed variation in flow conditions across the scramjet duct.&#182;

The effectiveness of the diagnostic was tested by comparing results with those from other measurement techniques, in particular pressure and OH fluorescence measurements, as well as comparison with computational simulation.&#182;

Combustion was noted at both of the tested operating conditions in data from all three measurement techniques.&#182;

Computation simulation of the scramjet flow significantly under-predicted the water vapour concentration. The discrepancy between experiments and simulation was not apparent in either the pressure measurements or the OH fluorescence, but was clear in the diode laser results.&#182;

The diode laser sensor, therefore, was able to produce quantitative results which were useful for comparison with a CFD model of the scramjet and were complimentary to information provided by other diagnostics.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diode laser sensor</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">scramjet</field><field name="subject">hypersonic</field><field name="subject">supersonic combustion</field><field name="subject">water vapour</field><field name="subject">instrumentation</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20051114.132736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benthic Bulldozers and Pumps: Laboratory and Modelling Studies of Bioturbation and Bioirrigation</field><field name="creator">Grigg, Nicola Jane</field><field name="description">Aquatic sediments are the recipients of a continual rain of organic debris from the water column. The decomposition reactions within the sediment and the rates of material exchange between the sediment and water column are critically moderated by the transport processes within the sediment. The sediment and solute movement induced by burrowing animals &#150; bioturbation and bioirrigation &#150; far exceed abiotic transport processes such as sedimentation burial and molecular diffusion. Thalassinidean shrimp are particularly abundant burrowing animals. Living in high density populations along coastlines around the world, these shrimp build complex burrow networks which they actively maintain and irrigate.&#182;

I used a laser scanner to map thalassinidean shrimp (Trypaea australiensis) mound formation. These experiments measured rapid two-way exchange between the sediment and depth. Subduction from the sediment surface proved to be just as important as sediment expulsion from depth, yet this is not detected by conventional direct entrapment techniques. The experiments demonstrated that a daily sampling frequency was needed to capture the extent of the two-way exchange.&#182;

I derived a one-dimensional non-local model accounting for the excavation, infill and collapse (EIC) of burrows. Maximum likelihood analyses were used to test the model against 210Pb and 228Th profiles taken from sediment cores in Port Phillip Bay, Melbourne. The maximum likelihood approach proved to be a useful technique for quantifying parameter confidence bounds and allowing formal comparison with a comparable biodiffusion model. The EIC model generally outperformed the biodiffusion model, and in all cases best EIC model parameter estimates required some level of burrow infill with surface material. The EIC model was expanded to two and three dimensions, which allowed the representation of lateral heterogeneity resulting from the excavation, infill and collapse of burrow structures. A synthetic dataset generated by the two-dimensional model was used to demonstrate the effects of heterogeneity and core sampling on the mixing information that can be extracted from one-dimensional sediment core data.&#182;

Burrow irrigation brings oxygenated water into burrow depths, and can affect the nitrogen cycle by increasing the rates of coupled nitrification and denitrification reactions. I modelled the nitrogen chemistry in the annulus of sediment surrounding an irrigated burrow using a radially-symmetrical diffusion model. The model was applied to three published case studies involving thalassinidean shrimp experiments and to field data from Port Phillip Bay. The results highlighted divergences between current theoretical understanding and laboratory and field measurements. The model further demonstrated potential limitations of measurements of burrow characteristics and animal behaviour in narrow laboratory tanks. Activities of burrowing animals had been hypothesised to contribute to high denitrification rates within Port Phillip Bay. Modelling work in this thesis suggests that the model burrow density required to explain these high denitrification rates is not consistent with the sampled density of thalassinidean shrimp in the Bay, although dense burrows of other animals are likely to be important. Limitations of one-dimensional representations of nitrogen diagenesis were explored via comparisons between one-dimensional models and the full cylinder model.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioturbation</field><field name="subject">bioirrigation</field><field name="subject">diagenesis models</field><field name="subject">Port Phillip Bay</field><field name="subject">thalassinidean shrimp</field><field name="subject">denitrification</field><field name="subject">sediments</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060228.104425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of Online Learning</field><field name="creator">Harrington, Edward</field><field name="description">Online learning algorithms have several key advantages compared to their batch learning algorithm counterparts: they are generally more memory efficient, and computationally mor efficient; they are simpler to implement; and they are able to adapt to changes where the learning model is time varying. Online algorithms because of their simplicity are very appealing to practitioners. his thesis investigates several online learning algorithms and their application. The thesis has an underlying theme of the idea of combining several simple algorithms to give better performance. In this thesis we investigate: combining weights, combining hypothesis, and (sort of) hierarchical combining.&#182;
Firstly, we propose a new online variant of the Bayes point machine (BPM), called the online Bayes point machine (OBPM). We study the theoretical and empirical performance of the OBPm algorithm. We show that the empirical performance of the OBPM algorithm is comparable with other large margin classifier methods such as the approximately large margin algorithm (ALMA) and methods which maximise the margin explicitly, like the support vector machine (SVM). The OBPM algorithm when used with a parallel architecture offers potential computational savings compared to ALMA. We compare the test error performance of the OBPM algorithm with other online algorithms: the Perceptron, the voted-Perceptron, and Bagging. We demonstrate that the combinationof the voted-Perceptron algorithm and the OBPM algorithm, called voted-OBPM algorithm has better test error performance than the voted-Perceptron and Bagging algorithms. We investigate the use of various online voting methods against the problem of ranking, and the problem of collaborative filtering of instances. We look at the application of online Bagging and OBPM algorithms to the telecommunications problem of channel equalization. We show that both online methods were successful at reducing the effect on the test error of label flipping and additive noise.&#182;
Secondly, we introduce a new mixture of experts algorithm, the fixed-share hierarchy (FSH) algorithm. The FSH algorithm is able to track the mixture of experts when the switching rate between the best experts may not be constant. We study the theoretical aspects of the FSH and the practical application of it to adaptive equalization. Using simulations we show that the FSH algorithm is able to track the best expert, or mixture of experts, in both the case where the switching rate is constant and the case where the switching rate is time varying.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">online learning algorithms</field><field name="subject">perceptron</field><field name="subject">large margin classifiers</field><field name="subject">Bayes point machine</field><field name="subject">BPM</field><field name="subject">online Bayes point machine</field><field name="subject">OBPM</field><field name="subject">tracking experts</field><field name="subject">fixed share hierarchy algorithm</field><field name="subject">FSH</field><field name="subject">channel equalization</field><field name="subject">equalizer</field><field name="subject">line voting</field><field name="subject">ranking algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060328.160810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in Sinhala Syntax</field><field name="creator">Henadeerage, Kumara</field><field name="description">This study is a detailed investigation of a number of issues in colloquial

concepts of the theoretical framework of Lexical Functional Grammar.&#182; The 
next three chapters mainly concern grammatical relations, argument 
structure and clause structure in colloquial Sinhala. Chapter 3 examines 
grammatical relations. The main focus lies in establishing the subject 
grammatical relation in terms of various subjecthood diagnostics. We show 
that only a very small number of diagnostics are reliable, and that the 
evidence for subject is weaker than assumed previously. All the subjecthood 
diagnostics that were examined select the most prominent argument in the 
argument structure as the subject, i.e. 'logical subject'. However, there 
appear to be no processes in the language that are sensitive to the subject 
in the grammatical relations structure, i.e. 'gr-subject'. Further, there 
is no evidence for other grammatical relations like objects. In Chapter 4 
we discuss the agentless construction and related valency alternation 
phenomena. It was previously assumed that the agentless construction, 
valency alternation phenomena and the involitive construction are all 
related. We argue that the agentless construction should be treated as a 
different construction from the involitive construction. We also show that 
the agentless construction and the involitive construction have contrasting 
characteristics, and that treatment of them as separate constructions can 
account for some phenomena which did not receive an explanation previously. 
The valency alternation phenomena are related to the agentless 
construction, therefore there is no valency alternation in involitive 
constructions. It will be shown that verbs undergoing the valency 
alternation can be distinguished from the other verbs in terms of the 
lexical semantic properties of individual verbs. Chapter 5 examines the 
structure of non-verbal sentences in terms of a number of morphosyntactic 
phenomena. It was previously argued that verbal sentences and non-verbal 
sentences in colloquial Sinhala differ in terms of clause structure. 
However, the present study shows evidence to the contrary.&#182; The next two 
chapters deal with modelling contrastive focus and the phrase structure of 
the language. Chapter 6 is a detailed analysis of the contrastive focus 
(cleft) construction in various clause types in the language, and proposes 
a unified syntactic treatment of contrastive focus. Contrastive focus is in 
some constructions morphologically encoded, while in others it involves 
both morphological and configurational assignment of focus. The complex 
interaction between focus markers and verb morphology in various focus 
constructions is accounted for by general well-formedness conditions 
applying to the f-structure, and the principles of Functional Uncertainty 
and Morphological Blocking. In Chapter 7, we discuss the phrase structure 
of the language, in particular such issues as its non-configurational 
nature and the lack of evidence for VP. We propose non-configurational S 
and some functional projections to account for word order freedom under S 
and to explain certain morphosyntactic phenomena, such as configurational 
focus assignment. Finally, Chapter 8 summarises the conclusions made in 
previous chapters.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sinhala</field><field name="subject">grammatical relations</field><field name="subject">morphosyntax</field><field name="subject">subject</field><field name="subject">volitionality</field><field name="subject">valency</field><field name="subject">argument strucure</field><field name="subject">phrase structure</field><field name="subject">non-verbal sentences</field><field name="subject">focus</field><field name="subject">non-configurationality</field><field name="subject">Lexical functional grammar</field><field name="subject">case marking</field><field name="subject">South Asian Languages</field><field name="subject">grammar</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060426.142352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deliberating Across Difference:
Bringing Social Learning into the Theory and Practice of Deliberative Democracy in the Case of Turkey</field><field name="creator">Kanra, Bora</field><field name="description">This thesis will argue that one of the main challenges for deliberative democracy is the lack of attention paid to the different modes of deliberative practices. The theories of deliberative democracy often treat deliberation as a decision-making process. Yet, I would argue that this approach fails to appreciate the full benefits of deliberation because it ignores the fundamental role that the social learning phase of deliberation plays in reconciling differences. Hence I argue for a deliberative framework in which social learning and decision-making moments of deliberation are analytically differentiated so that the resources of social learning are freed from the pressures of decision-making procedures and are therefore no longer subordinated to the terms of decision-making.&#182; 

This is particularly important for countries such as Turkey where divisions cut deep across society. A case study examines the discourses of the Turkish public sphere regarding Islam, democracy and secularism to identify the kinds of discourses present in relation to the topic in question. By analysing the types of discourses through Q methodology the study reveals points of convergence and divergence between discourses, hence provides significant insight into how deliberation oriented to social learning can play a substantive role in reconciling differences between sharply divided groups.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deliberative Democracy</field><field name="subject">Social Learning</field><field name="subject">Islam and Democracy</field><field name="subject">Turkey</field><field name="subject">Islamic and Secular Discourses</field><field name="subject">Divided Societies</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20051202.161618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Socioeconomic status and health: exploring biological pathways</field><field name="creator">Lucas, Robyn Marjorie</field><field name="description">The cross-sectional Biomarkers Study was undertaken in Canberra, Australia (2000-2002) to examine the role of psychosocial factors in the socioeconomic health gradient, via physiological changes consequent upon activation of the neuroendocrine
stress response.&#182;
The study population was derived from healthy 40-44 year old men and women
already participating in a longitudinal cohort study. Using data from the cohort study, four groups with similar occupational status were formed. The study sample was randomly selected within these groups, thus representing the socioeconomic spectrum.&#182;
A pilot study involved 60 participants with blood and saliva samples measured on two occasions. A further 302 people had blood and saliva samples taken on one occasion. Socioeconomic status was measured by occupational code and status,
personal and household income, education and perceived position in the community and in Australia. Psychosocial and behavioural factors, including job strain, job security, coping style, anxiety, depression, optimism, self-esteem, sense of belonging and trust, social support, smoking, exercise and alcohol intake were assessed by selfreport.
Five biological parameters: plasma fibrinogen, glycated haemoglobin, waisthip ratio, serum neopterin and salivary IgA were measured as outcome variables.Three hypotheses were tested:&#182;

1. There is a socioeconomic gradient in measures of psychosocial stress, and of
psychological resilience.&#182;
2. There is a socioeconomic gradient in biological measures that have a plausible&#182;
association with future disease.
3. Psychosocial factors mediate the demonstrated association between
socioeconomic status and the biological measures.&#182;
Data analysis confirmed a socioeconomic gradient in some psychosocial and
behavioural variables: economic strain (r=-0.44, p&amp;lt0.001), job demands (r=0.45,
p&amp;lt0.001), job control (r=0.26, p&amp;lt0.001), active coping style (r=0.28, p &amp;lt0.001), sense
of optimism (r=0.24, p&amp;lt0.001), social capital (r=0.26, p&amp;lt0.001), job security (r=0.17,
p=0.002), job marketability (r=-0.16, p=0.005), sense of belonging (r=0.22, p&amp;lt0.001),
number of adverse life events (r=-0.13, p=0.01) and positive interaction with family
and friends (r=0.20, p&amp;lt0.001 ), vigorous physical activity (r=-0.16, p=0.002), alcohol
consumption (r=0.30, p&amp;lt0.001) and smoking status (r=-0.25, p&amp;lt0.001). There was no
socioeconomic gradient in anxiety, depression, neuroticism, hostility, locus of
control, self-esteem, perceived stress or mental health (SF-12). Four of the five
biological markers varied with socioeconomic status: plasma fibrinogen (female (F):
r=-0.26, p=0.002, male (M) r=-0.08, p=0.30), glycated haemoglobin (F: r=-0.23,
p=0.01, M: r=-0.11, p=0.17), waist-hip ratio (F: r=-0.19, p=0.03, M: r=-0.27,
p&amp;lt0.001), serum neopterin (F: r=-0.21, p=0.009, M: r=-0.04, p=0.56), salivary IgA
(F: r=-0.07, p=0.38, M: r=0.004, p=0.97). A more adverse biological profile was
associated with lower socioeconomic status. Work characteristics, coping style,
smoking and exercise were particularly important mediators of the association
between the biological markers and socioeconomic status. Particular psychosocial factors were consistent mediators of the association between specific biomarkers and
socioeconomic status (with little variation for different measures of socioeconomic
status). However, the particular psychosocial factors providing significant mediation
varied for the different markers.&#182;
In this sample of healthy 40-44 year olds, four out of five biological markers showed
moderate socioeconomic variation with a more favourable profile associated with
higher SES. The data provide limited support for the importance of psychosocial
factors in the socioeconomic health gradient.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">socioeconomics status</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">biological markers</field><field name="subject">immune function</field><field name="subject">psychosocial factors</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060426.095241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying stand structural complexity in woodland and dry Sclerophyll Forest, South-Eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">McElhinny, Chris</field><field name="description">In this thesis I present and test a methodology for developing a stand scale index of structural complexity. If properly designed such an index can act as a summary variable for a larger set of stand structural attributes, providing a means of ranking stands in terms of their structural complexity, and by association, their biodiversity and vegetation condition. This type of index can also facilitate the use of alternative policy instruments for biodiversity conservation, such as mitigation banking, auctions and offsets, that rely on a common currency &#150; the index value &#150; that can be compared or traded between sites. My intention was to establish a clear and documentable methodology for developing a stand scale index of structural complexity, and to test this methodology using data from real stands.&#182;

As a starting point, I reviewed the literature concerning forest and woodland structure and found there was no clear definition of stand structural complexity, or definitive suite of structural attributes for characterising it. To address this issue, I defined stand structural complexity as a combined measure of the number of different structural attributes present in a stand, and the relative abundance of each of these attributes. This was analogous to approaches that have quantified diversity in terms of the abundance and richness of elements. It was also concluded from the review, that stand structural complexity should be viewed as a relative, rather than absolute concept, because the potential levels of different structural attributes are bound within certain limits determined by the inherent characteristics of the site in question, and the biota of the particular community will have evolved to reflect this range of variation. This implied that vegetation communities with naturally simple structures should have the potential to achieve high scores on an index of structural complexity.&#182;

I proposed the following five-stage methodology for developing an index of stand structural complexity:
1. Establish a comprehensive suite of stand structural attributes as a starting point for developing the index, by reviewing studies in which there is an established relationship between elements of biodiversity and structural attributes.
2. Develop a measurement system for quantifying the different attributes included in the comprehensive suite.
3. Use this measurement system to collect data from a representative set of stands across the range of vegetation condition (highly modified to unmodified) and developmental stages (regrowth to oldgrowth) occurring in the vegetation communities in which the index is intended to operate.
4. Identify a core set of structural attributes from an analysis of these data.
5. Combine the core attributes in a simple additive index, in which attributes are scored relative to their observed levels in each vegetation community.&#182;

Stage one of this methodology was addressed by reviewing a representative sample of the literature concerning fauna habitat relationships in temperate Australian forests and woodlands. This review identified fifty-five studies in south-east and south-west Australia, in which the presence or abundance of different fauna were significantly (p&amp;lt0.05) associated with vegetation structural attributes. The majority of these studies concerned bird, arboreal mammal, and ground mammal habitat requirements, with relatively fewer studies addressing the habitat requirements of reptiles, invertebrates, bats or amphibians. Thirty four key structural attributes were identified from these fifty-five studies, by grouping similar attributes, and then representing each group with a single generic attribute. This set, in combination with structural attributes identified in the earlier review, provided the basis for developing an operational set of stand level attributes for the collection of data from study sites.&#182;

To address stages two and three of the methodology, data were collected from one woodland community &#150;Yellow Box-Red Gum (E. melliodora-E. Blakelyi ) &#150; and two dry sclerophyll forest communities &#150; Broadleaved Peppermint-Brittle Gum (E. dives-E. mannifera ), Scribbly Gum-Red Stringybark (E. rossii E. macrorhyncha ) &#150; in a 15,000 km2 study area in the South eastern Highlands Bioregion of Australia. A representative set of 48 sites was established within this study area, by identifying 24 strata, on the basis of the three vegetation communities, two catchments, two levels of rainfall and two levels of condition, and then locating two sites (replicates) within each stratum. At each site, three plots were systematically established, to provide an unbiased estimate of stand level means for 75 different structural attributes.&#182;

I applied a three-stage analysis to identify a core set of attributes from these data. The first stage &#150; a preliminary analysis &#150; indicated that the 48 study sites represented a broad range of condition, and that the two dry sclerophyll communities could be treated as a single community, which was structurally distinct from the woodland community. In the second stage of the analysis, thirteen core attributes were dentified using the criteria that a core attribute should:&#182;
1. Be either, evenly or approximately normally distributed amongst study sites;
2. Distinguish between woodland and dry sclerophyll communities;
3. Function as a surrogate for other attributes;
4. Be efficient to measure in the field.
The core attributes were: Vegetation cover &amp;lt0.5m Vegetation cover 0.5-6.0m; Perennial species richness; Lifeform richness; Stand basal area of live trees; Quadratic mean diameter of live stems; ln(number of regenerating stems per ha+1); ln(number of hollow bearing trees per ha+1);ln(number of dead trees per ha+1);sqrt(number of live stems per ha &amp;gt40cm dbh); sqrt(total log length per ha); sqrt(total largelog length per ha); Litter dry weight per ha. This analysis also demonstrated that the thirteen core attributes could be modelled as continuous variables, and that these variables were indicative of the scale at which the different attributes operated.&#182;

In the third and final stage of the analysis, Principal Components Analysis was used to test for redundancy amongst the core attributes. Although this analysis highlighted six groupings, within which attributes were correlated to some degree, these relationships were not considered sufficiently robust to justify reducing the number of core attributes.&#182;

The thirteen core attributes were combined in a simple additive index, in which, each attribute accounted for 10 points in a total index value of 130. Attributes were rescaled as a score from 0-10, using equations that modelled attribute score as a function of the raw attribute data. This maintained a high correlation (r &gt; 0.97, p&lt; 0.0001) between attribute scores and the original attribute data. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the index was not sensitive to attribute weightings, and on this basis attributes carried equal weight. In this form my index was straightforward to apply, and approximately normally distributed amongst study sites.&#182;

I demonstrated the practical application of the index in a user-friendly spreadsheet, designed to allow landowners and managers to assess the condition of their vegetation, and to identify management options. This spreadsheet calculated an index score from field data, and then used this score to rank the site relative to a set of reference sites. This added a regional context to the operation of the index, and is a potentially useful tool for identifying sites of high conservation value, or for identifying sites where management actions have maintained vegetation quality. The spreadsheet also incorporated the option of calculating an index score using a subset of attributes, and provided a measure of the uncertainty associated with this score.&#182;

I compared the proposed index with five prominent indices used to quantify vegetation condition or habitat value in temperate Australian ecosystems. These were: Newsome and Catling&#146;s (1979) Habitat Complexity Score, Watson et al.&#146;s (2001) Habitat Complexity Score, the Site Condition Score component of the Habitat Hectares Index of Parkes et al. (2003), the Vegetation Condition Score component of the Biodiversity Benefits Index of Oliver and Parkes (2003), and the Vegetation Condition Score component of the BioMetric Assessment Tool of Gibbons et al. (2004). I found that my index differentiated between study sites better than each of these indices. However, resource and time constraints precluded the use of a new and independent data set for this testing, so that the superior performance of my index must be interpreted cautiously.&#182;

As a group, the five indices I tested contained attributes describing compositional diversity, coarse woody debris, regeneration, large trees and hollow trees &#150; these were attributes that I also identified as core ones. However, unlike these indices, I quantified weeds indirectly through their effect on indigenous plant diversity, I included the contribution of non-indigenous species to vegetation cover and did not apply a discount to this contribution, I limited the direct assessment of regeneration to long-lived overstorey species, I used stand basal area as a surrogate for canopy cover, I quantified litter in terms of biomass (dry weight) rather than cover, and I included the additional attributes of quadratic mean diameter and the number of dead trees.&#182;

I also concluded that Parkes et al. (2003), Oliver and Parkes (2003), and Gibbons et al. (2004), misapplied the concept of benchmarking, by characterising attributes in terms of a benchmark range or average level. This ignored processes that underpin variation at the stand level, such as the increased development of some attributes at particular successional stages, and the fact that attributes can respond differently to disturbance agents. It also produced indices that were not particularly sensitive to the differences in attribute levels occurring between stands. I suggested that a more appropriate application of benchmarking would be at the overarching level of stand structural complexity, using a metric such as the index developed in this thesis. These benchmarks could reflect observed levels of structural complexity in unmodified natural stands at different successional stages, or thresholds for structural complexity at which a wide range of biota are present, and would define useful goals for guiding on-ground management.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stand structure</field><field name="subject">stand structural complexity</field><field name="subject">structural complexity index</field><field name="subject">structural diversity</field><field name="subject">vegetation condition</field><field name="subject">biodiversity indicator</field><field name="subject">fauna habitat</field><field name="subject">coarse woody debris</field><field name="subject">hollow bearing tree</field><field name="subject">dry sclerophyll forest</field><field name="subject">eucalypt woodland</field><field name="subject">eucalypt forest</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060322.133914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Politik is poison: the politics of memory among the Churches of Christ in northern Vanuatu</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Michael G.</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of the ways in which past and present Churches of Christ worshippers from northern Vanuatu reflect on politik (Bislama: politics, political action but also much more). To comprehend what this term means to local people in Vanuatu, we must be aware of the contexts in which it is used, the events and relationships that are its exemplars and the local political economies of historical knowledge that inflect its meanings. To this end, this thesis explores the origins of politik as described by my interlocutors through oral histories about the interplay between their church, state institutions and Nagriamel, a traditionalist movement which emerged on Santo in 1967 and spread quickly throughout the northern New Hebrides. Through an examination of the content of these spoken histories, this thesis suggests that politik is seen to have corroded the unity of pre-existing social groups, such as the church, which is considered by its adherents to be indigenous. As a contingent state of democracy, politik describes the unwanted aspects of modernity and nationhood based on the perceived emergence of hierarchies between indigenous people in the post-colonial state of Vanuatu. Given that the rise of Nagriamel is considered to have inspired the resurgence of kastom where previously it was proscribed, kastom is often seen by conventional worshippers to be something to endure rather than celebrate. Among Churches of Christ worshippers, the conflict between kastom and church doctrine is considered to constitute part of the conflict inherent in politik.&#182;
Given that much of the knowledge on which this thesis was based was collected during interpersonal and group interviews, this thesis also explores the creation of political economies of historical knowledge about politik. Through a review of oral historical methodologies and appropriate anthropological theory, it examines the nature of information collected during participant-observation. As this thesis compares different genres of historical information (local, oral histories, national public histories and colonial archival records) it is also concerned with historical methodology.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">politik</field><field name="subject">Churches of Christ</field><field name="subject">oral history</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">northern Vanuatu</field><field name="subject">kastom</field><field name="subject">Nagriamel</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060125.114315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning Comprehensible Theories from Structured Data</field><field name="creator">Ng, Kee Siong</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the problem of 
learning comprehensible theories from 
structured data and covers primarily  classification and regression learning. The basic knowledge representation language 
is set around a polymorphically-typed, 
higher-order logic. The general setup is closely related to the learning from propositionalized knowledge and learning from interpretations settings in Inductive Logic Programming. Individuals (also called instances) are represented as terms in the logic. A grammar-like construct called a predicate rewrite system is used to define features in the form of predicates that individuals may or may not satisfy. For learning, decision-tree algorithms of various kinds are adopted.&#182;

The scope of the thesis spans both theory and practice. On the theoretical side, I study in this thesis&#182;
 1. the representational power of different function classes and relationships between them;&#182;
 2. the sample complexity of some commonly-used predicate classes, particularly those involving sets and multisets;&#182;
 3. the computational complexity of various optimization problems associated with learning and algorithms for solving them; and&#182;
 4. the (efficient) learnability of different function classes in the PAC and agnostic PAC models.&#182;

On the practical side, the usefulness of the learning system developed is demontrated with applications in two important domains:
bioinformatics and intelligent agents. Specifically, the following are covered in this thesis:&#182;
 1. a solution to a benchmark multiple-instance learning problem and some useful lessons that can be drawn from it;&#182;
 2. a successful attempt on a knowledge discovery problem in predictive toxicology, one that can serve as another proof-of-concept that real chemical knowledge can be obtained using symbolic learning;&#182;

This study examines people-centred Thai NGOs trying to help peasants empower themselves in order to compete better in conflicts over land, water, forest, and capital, during the 1970s to 1990s.  The study investigates how the NGOs contested asymmetric power relations among government officials, private entrepreneurs and ordinary people while helping raise the people&#146;s confidence in their own power to negotiate their demands with other actors.&#182;
The thesis argues that the NGOs are able to play an interventionist role when a number of key factors coexist.  First, the NGOs are able to understand local situations, which contain asymmetric power relations between different actors, in relation to current changes in the wider context of the Thai political economy and seize the time to take action.  Secondly, the NGOs are able to articulate a social meaning beyond the dominating rhetoric of the &#145;state&#146; and the &#145;capitalists&#146; which encourages the people&#146;s participation in collective activities.  Thirdly, while dealing with one problem in social relations and negotiation with local environment, the NGOs are able to recognise new problems as they arise and rapidly identify a new political space for the actors to renegotiate their conflicting interests and demands.  Fourthly, the NGOs are able to recreate new meanings, new actors and reform their organisations and networks to deal with new situations.  Finally, the NGOs are able to effectively use three pillars of their movement, namely individuals, organisations and networks to deal with everyday politics and collective protest.&#182;
The case studies in three villages in Northern Thailand reveal that the NGOs were able to play an interventionist role in specific situations through their alternative development strategies somewhat influenced by structural Marxism.  The thesis recommends that the NGO interventionist role be continued so as to overcome tensions within the NGO community, for instance, between the NGOs working at the grass-roots level and the NGOs working at regional and national levels (including NGO funding agencies); local everyday conflicts; and the bipolar views of a society among the NGOs expressed in dichotomous thinking between &#145;rural&#146; and &#145;urban&#146;, &#145;community&#146; and &#145;state&#146;, conflict and order, actor and system.&#182;
The fragmentation of NGO social and environmental movements showed that there is no single formula or easy solution to the problems.  If the NGOs want to continue their interventionist role to help empower ordinary people and help them gain access to productive resources, they must move beyond their bipolar views of a society to discover the middle ground to search for new meanings, new actors, new issues and to create again and again counter-hegemony movements.  This could be done by having abstract development theories assessed and enriched by concrete development practices and vice versa.  Both theorists and practitioners need to use their own imagination to invent and reinvent what and how best to continue.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NGOs</field><field name="subject">everyday politics</field><field name="subject">peasants</field><field name="subject">transformation</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">rural Thai society</field><field name="subject">social movement</field><field name="subject">Alaine Touraine</field><field name="subject">actor-agency relations</field><field name="subject">social meaning and action synthesis</field><field name="subject">time-space correspondence</field><field name="subject">cultural geography</field><field name="subject">community culture</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060227.084102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A gendered self or a gendered context? A social identity approach to gender differences</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Michelle K.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the way in which traditional accounts of gender differences in the self-concept have relied on distal explanatory factors, and have thus conceptualised the gendered self as stable across both time and situation. This notion of
a stable, gendered self has been implicated as underlying of a range of psychological gender differences (e.g., Cross &amp; Madson, 1997), such as those in moral reasoning (e.g., Gillian, 1982) and ways of knowing (e.g., Belenky et al., 1989). As a result, these
behaviours are also seen to be stable across time and context.&#182;

An alternative perspective is investigated, which looks to social identity theory and self-categorisation theory for a conceptualisation of both gender and the self-concept
as being malleable and context-dependent (e.g., Turner et al., 1987). The social identity perspective describes the way in which proximal aspects of the social context affect the expression of gender-related behaviours, attitudes, and beliefs. In this way, the social identity perspective provides an analysis of group membership, group norms, and social influence which can not only account for the differences that are observed between men
and women, but can also offer an analysis of the context-dependence of these difference and an approach by which gender differences can be mollified.&#182;

A series of nine empirical studies are reported, investigating the way in which individuals (a) define themselves, (b) approach moral reasoning, and (c) approach
knowledge and learning, across a number of different social contexts. Together, the results suggest that the self-concept, moral orientation, and ways of knowing are neither
stable nor inherently gendered, but are malleable and dependent on the nature of the self-other relationship as defined by the proximal aspects of the social context. The implications for traditional theories of gender differences are discussed, as are the
broader implications for feminism and social change.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">self-concept</field><field name="subject">social identity theory</field><field name="subject">self-categorization theory</field><field name="subject">moral reasoning</field><field name="subject">ways of knowing</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060210.091938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multidimensional assessment of health and functional status in older Aboriginal Australians from Katherine and Lajamanu, Northern Territory</field><field name="creator">Sevo, Goran</field><field name="description">Human health is multidimensional: apart from physical, mental, and social aspects, it also
incorporates subjective perceptions of health, and functional status (FS). Given that elderly
persons have very distinctive health and social needs, multidimensional assessment (MA)
of health proves particularly useful in this age group.&#182;
Aboriginal populations suffer poor health, and there are relatively few studies addressing
the health problems of older Aboriginal Australians, mainly because of their distinctive
demographic structure, and the low proportion of their elderly. Also, there is no prior
information available on MA of health in this Australian population group.&#182;
This thesis offers a MA of health in older Aboriginal persons from two, urban and
rural/isolated, locations in the NT, Katherine and Lajamanu (the NT survey).&#182;
This thesis specifically addresses the following questions:
- what is the physical health, FS, subjective perception of health, and social
functioning amongst the NT survey participants?
- what are the possible similarities and differences in various dimensions of health
between the two major survey locations, what age and gender patterns are
observed, and what are the reasons for these patterns, similarities and

- how do various dimensions of health relate to each other, and why?
- how do current findings relate to broader Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
populations, and why?
- what can MA add to a better understanding of various aspects of morbidity and
health care use?
- what are its possible implications for health planning?&#182;
Findings from this work indicate poor physical health amongst participants in almost all
investigated aspects, comparable to information available from other Aboriginal
populations. These are accompanied by low levels of ability for physical functioning. Despite this, subjective perception of health is rather optimistic amongst participants, and
levels of social functioning high. Use of health services is mainly related to available health
infrastructure. Important health differences exist between Katherine and Lajamanu, and
they became particularly visible when all dimensions of health are considered together.&#182;
The Main conclusions from the current work are that 1) poor physical health is not
necessarily accompanied by similar level of deterioration in other dimensions of health:
even though participants from the isolated community of Lajamanu experience most
chronic diseases, their ability for physical functioning is better, self-perceived health (SPH)
more optimistic and levels of social functioning highest 2) institutionalised participants from
Katherine suffer by far the worst health of all sample segments in this study; at least some
of the poor health outcomes are potentially avoidable, and could be improved by more
appropriate residential choices for Aboriginal elderly 3) better health infrastructure does
not necessarily bring better health in all its dimensions, suggesting that other factors
(primarily socio-economic and cultural) should be addressed in conjunction with this in
solving complex health problems of Aboriginal Australians, and 4) it provides strong
support that MA can become a useful tool in comprehensive health assessment of older
Aboriginals.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health problems</field><field name="subject">older Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">multidimensional assessment of health</field><field name="subject">MA</field><field name="subject">Katherine</field><field name="subject">Lajamanu</field><field name="subject">Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">age</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">patterns</field><field name="subject">health planning</field><field name="subject">physical health</field><field name="subject">self-perceived health</field><field name="subject">SPH</field><field name="subject">functional status</field><field name="subject">FS</field><field name="subject">health services</field><field name="subject">health and social functioning</field><field name="subject">functional ability</field><field name="subject">elderly</field><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20051021.144853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum Information
Processing in Rare Earth Ion
Doped Insulators</field><field name="creator">Longdell, Jevon Joseph</field><field name="description">A great deal of theoretical activity has resulted from blending the fields of computer science and quantum mechanics. Out of this work has come the concept of a quantum computer, which promises to solve problems currently intractable for classical computers. This promise has, in turn, generated a large amount of effort directed toward investigating quantum computing experimentally.
&#182;
Quantum computing is difficult because fragile quantum superposition states of the computer&#146;s register must be protected from the environment. This is made more difficult by the need to manipulate and measure these states.
&#182;
This thesis describes work that was carried out both to investigate and to demonstrate the utility of rare earth ion dopants for quantum computation. Dopants in solids are seen by many as a potential means of achieving scalable quantum computing. Rare earth ion dopants are an obvious choice for investigating such quantum computation. Long coherence times for both optical and nuclear spin transitions have been observed as well as optical manipulation of the spin states. The advantage that the scheme developed here has over nearly all of its competitors is that no complex nanofabrication is required. The advantages of avoiding nano-fabrication are two fold. Firstly, coherence times are likely to be adversely effected by the &#147;damage&#148; to the crystal structure that this manufacture represents. Secondly, the nano-fabrication presents a very serious difficulty in itself.
&#182;
Because of these advantages it was possible to perform two-qubit operations between independent qubits. This is the first time that such operations have been performed and presents a milestone in quantum computation using dopants in solids. It is only the second time two-qubit operations have been demonstrated in a solid.
&#182;
The experiments performed in this thesis were in two main areas: The first was the characterisation of hyperfine interactions in rare earth ion dopants; the second, simple demonstrations directly related to quantum computation.
&#182;
The first experiments that were carried out were to characterise the hyperfine interactions in Pr[superscript 3]+:Y[subscript 2]SiO[subscript 5]. The characterisation was the first carried out for the dopants in a site of such low symmetry. The resulting information about oscillator strengths and transition frequencies should prove indispensable when using such a system for quantum computation. It has already enabled an increase in the coherence times of nuclear spin transitions by two orders of magnitudes.
&#182;
The experiments directly related to the demonstration of quantum computation were all carried out using ensembles. The presence of a significant distribution of resonant frequencies, or inhomogeneous broadening, meant that many different sub-ensembles could be addressed, based on their resonant frequencies. Furthermore, the properties of the sub-ensembles could be engineered by optically pumping unwanted members to different hyperfine states away from resonance with the laser.
&#182;
A previously demonstrated technique for realising ensembles that could be used as single qubits was investigated and improved. Also, experiments were carried out to demonstrate the resulting ensembles&#146; utility as qubits. Further to this, ions from one of the ensembles were selected out, based on their interaction with the ions of another. Elementary two qubit operations were then demonstrated using these ensembles.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum computing</field><field name="subject">ion doped insulators</field><field name="subject">rare earth ion dopants</field><field name="subject">qubits</field><field name="subject">hyperfine interactions</field><field name="subject">ensembles</field><field name="subject">tomography</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20061010.105020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct Measurement of the Spectral Distribution of Thermal Noise</field><field name="creator">Slagmolen, Bram Johannes Jozef</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the direct measurement of the thermal noise spectral distribution.
Long base line gravitational wave detectors, being commissioned around
the world, are limited in sensitivity in the intermediate frequencies by the thermal
noise. These detectors are utilising suspended test mirrors for the detection of gravitational
waves by measuring their relative displacement. One of the fundamental
noise sources in these detectors is the thermally induced displacement of the suspension
onto and within the mirrors. This thermally induced motion of the test mirrors
limits the displacement sensitivity of the gravitational wave detectors. Knowledge
of the spectral behavior of thermal noise over a wide frequency range will improve
predictions and understanding of the behavior of the suspension and test mirrors.&#182;

In this thesis the direct measurement of the thermal noise spectral distribution
of a mechanical flexure resonator is described. The mechanical flexure resonator is
an unidirectional &#8217;wobbly table&#8217; made from copper-beryllium, which hinges around
four thin flexures 15 mm wide, 1 mm high and ~116 &#181;m thick. The mechanical
flexure resonator has a resonant frequency of 192 Hz, with a quality factor of ~3000.&#182;

The thermal noise induced displacement of the mechanical flexure resonator was
measured using an optical cavity. The end mirror of a two mirror optical cavity was
mounted on the mechanical flexure resonator. A laser was made resonant with the
test cavity by use of a locking control system. Thermal noise induced displacement
moved the test cavity away from resonance. By measuring the error-signal in the
control system, the equivalent thermal noise displacement was obtained.&#182;

The thermal noise induced displacement of the mechanical flexure resonator was
predicted to be in the order of 10^(&#8722;12) to 10^(&#8722;17) m/sqrtHz over a frequency range of
10 Hz to 10 kHz. All other external noise sources needed to be suppressed to below
this level. A major noise source was the laser frequency fluctuations. When the
test cavity was locked to the laser, the laser frequency fluctuations dominated the
read out signal. To suppress the frequency fluctuations, the laser was locked to a
rigid long optical reference cavity. This allowed the frequency fluctuations to be
suppressed to below the equivalent thermal noise displacement of the test cavity
over the frequency range of interest.&#182;

Acoustic noise was suppressed by placing the whole experiment inside a vacuum
chamber, and evacuating the air inside the chamber down to a pressure level of
10^(&#8722;4) mbar. A seismic vibration isolation system was used to suppress the seismic
noise in the laboratory to below 10^(&#8722;14) m/sqrtHz at frequencies above 4 Hz.&#182;

With the experimental set up, the thermal noise displacement of the mechanical
flexure resonator has been measured. Due to the degradation of the isolator performance,
measurement of the thermal noise behavior over a wide frequency range of
the mechanical flexure resonator was unsuccessful. By using an analytical curve fitting
routine around the fundamental and first order resonant modes of the resonator, 
a loss factor of (3.5 &#177; 1.5 &#8722; 3.7 &#177; 1.5) &#215; 10^(&#8722;4) for the copper-beryllium mechanical
flexure resonator was obtained and structural damping was inferred.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interferometer</field><field name="subject">gravitational waves</field><field name="subject">optics</field><field name="subject">suspension</field><field name="subject">laser frequency noise</field><field name="subject">laser intenstity noise</field><field name="subject">mechanical resonantor</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20051128.104552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the links between socioeconomic status and health in Australia: a dynamic microsimulation approach</field><field name="creator">Walker, Agnes Emilia</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the modelling of individuals&#146; health over the life course, within the framework set by the now substantial international literature on the relationship between socioeconomic status and health. The focus is on people with long term illnesses and related disabilities, on inequalities in health by socioeconomic status (SES) and on the impact of health on employment.&#182;
The main tool of analysis is a dynamic microsimulation model of the Australian population which tracks the demographic, socioeconomic and financial characteristics of individuals and their families over the life course. Its original form, developed at the National Centre for Socioeconomic Modelling, University of Canberra, is based on a one per cent representative sample of the Australian population (around 150,000 individuals), with a series of life course events simulated for individuals and their families up to 2050 - such as births, deaths, migration, taxes, education, labour force participation, earned income, wealth accumulation and government transfers. The model is written in the C programming language and was initially used on a UNIX system. The dramatic increases in the speed and memory size of PCs over the past five years has led to a PC version now being available.&#182; 
Despite their relatively short existence and long development phases, dynamic microsimulation models are now used in many developed countries &#150; for example, the USA, UK, Canada, France, Sweden, Norway and Italy. In recognition of their ability to analyse distributional and financial issues in considerably greater depth than what is possible with traditional methods, their use by government for policy analysis is rapidly increasing.&#182; 
In this thesis two new modules were added to the original Australian dynamic microsimulation model &#150; namely: a Health_SES module and a Health State Transitions module. The former makes the study of health inequalities across socioeconomic groups possible. The latter provides a link between health status and the ability of individuals to carry out every day activities as the severity of their ill-health increases with age. A major advantage of adding these new modules to an existing main model is that it allows much more comprehensive studies over the life courses of individuals than the alternative would allow &#150; that is the building of two stand-alone models developed exclusively for &#145;health-SES&#146; and &#145;health state transition&#146; types of applications.&#182;
The main data sources used to construct the two new modules were an extract from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare&#146;s Mortality database covering the 1995-97 period, and the Australian Bureau of Statistic&#146;s 1998 survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers. The analysis of the mortality data was handled using EXCEL, and that of the much larger Disability survey unit record dataset - over 40,000 individuals and 100s of variables &#150; using the SAS programming language.&#182; 
While most of the methodologies used in constructing the new modules are in line with what became the norm for dynamic microsimulation model development, the thesis contains several innovations. The main ones are: a quantitative assessment of the suitability of different types of SES indicators for studies of health inequalities; the modelling of the progression of people&#146;s health from illness-free status to mild and severe disability; the development of a methodology for estimating health state transition probabilities from cross-sectional data (in the absence of longitudinal data); and the linking of health status to individual&#146;s ability to stay in the labour force.&#182; 
As with most models, there are a number of limitations. These are discussed in the thesis, together with areas of possible future improvements.&#182;
The thesis also presents two novel and topical &#150; though at this stage illustrative &#150; applications of the enhanced dynamic microsimulation model. The first simulates the impact of a narrowing in health inequalities in Australia as health is lifted nationally to the level currently enjoyed by the most affluent 20% of the population. The findings are that, if such a policy change were implemented, close to half a million fewer Australians would be disabled, around 180,000 life years would be saved, health care costs would be around A$1 billion lower per year and the government could save close to A$700 million on the Disability Support Pension.&#182; 
The second application quantifies the likely impacts of longer working lives in future, which may arise from changes such as: more favourable labour market conditions; government incentives to remain in the labour force longer (eg the lifting of the pension age); and general improvements in health. This application estimates the probability that Australians aged 65-70 would work more than 15 hours per week, had such changes eventuated. The decision to retire is modelled as a function of each individual&#146;s own health, socioeconomic status, age, sex and family composition. The impacts are simulated in a world in which current patterns of health by age, sex and SES remain unchanged over time &#150; the Base case; and a world replicating the narrower health inequalities scenario of the first application. Under the Base case an additional 450,000 persons aged 65-70 years were estimated to remain in the workforce - with the related earnings totalling up to $20 billion in 1998 ($35 billion in 2018) and savings by government on the age pension of around $2 billion ($4 billion in 2018). Under the narrower health inequalities scenario the numbers working, their earnings and the related savings on the age pension were estimated to be around 7% higher.

It necessarily considers Australian atti-tudes towards the Chinese during the 19th century, not least the White Australia Pol-icy. The emergence of that discriminatory immigration policy over the second half of the 19th century until its national implementation in 1901 provides the background to the thesis. Cheong was the leading figure among Chinese-Australian Christians and a prominent figure in the Australian Chinese community and the thesis seeks to iden-tify a man whose contribution has largely been shadowy in other studies or, more commonly, overlooked by the parochialism of colony/state emphasis in many histo-ries of Australia. His role in the Christian church fills a space in Victorian religious history. 
Although Cheong accumulated great wealth he was not part of the Chinese mer-chant class of the huagong/huaquiao traditions of the overseas Chinese diaspora of the 19th and 20th centuries. His wealth was accumulated through property investments following the spectacular collapse of the Victorian banking system during the 1890s. His community leadership role arose through his position in the Christian Church rather than, as was generally the case, through business. His English language skills, resulting from his church association, were the key to his role as a Chinese community spokesman.&#182; 
Cheok Hong Cheong left an archive of some 800 documents in the English lan-guage covering the major people, incidents and concerns of his life and times. His Let-terbooks, together with the archives of the various Christian missions to the Chinese in Australia in the 19th and early 20th centuries, shed light on one person&#8217;s life and more broadly, through his involvements on the complex relationships of Chinese emigrants, with the often unsympathetic majority of Australians.&#182;
This is a case study of a Chinese identity formed outside China and influenced by a wider set of cultural influences than any other Chinese-Australian of his time &#8212;an identity that justifies the description of him as an &#8216;Alien Son&#8217;. Cheong&#8217;s story is a con-tribution to the urban and family history of an important ethnic sub-group within the wider immigrant history of Australia.&#182;
While Cheong remained a Chinese subject his identification with Australia cannot be questioned. All his children were born in Australia and he left just twice after his arrival in 1863. He visited England in 1891-2 and in 1906 he briefly visited China. Identity and culture issues are growing in importance as part of the revived relation-ship between the Chinese of the diaspora and the economic renewal of the People&#8217;s Republic of China and this thesis is offers a contribution to that discussion.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese identity</field><field name="subject">Cheok Hong Cheong</field><field name="subject">Australian attitudes</field><field name="subject">White Australia Policy</field><field name="subject">discriminatory immigration policy</field><field name="subject">Chinese-Australian Christians</field><field name="subject">'Alien Son'</field><field name="subject">Christian Church</field><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="subject">Australian Chinese Community</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20051108.111252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Circuits of migration: a structural analysis of migration in Peninsular Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Young, Mei Ling</field><field name="description">The main thesis of this study is that migration is an integral component of the major processes of structural change in a country.

Child victims of crime have to overcome the difficulties emerging from their victimization as well as those resulting from their participation in the adversarial criminal justice process. Child victims are typically treated by legal systems as either mere witnesses -- prosecutorial instruments -- or as objects of protection. Children's human rights and their needs beyond immediate protection are typically ignored.
&#182;
This thesis combines an examination of children's human rights (articulated largely in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child) with a review of psycho-social literature on children's needs. It integrates the two disciplines thus creating a `needs-rights' model regarding child victims. This model is then used to evaluate the criminal justice process and its successes (and failures) in meeting the needs and rights of child victims. Such an integrated needs-rights evaluation identifies not only the difficulties associated with testifying in court and being interviewed multiple times. It goes beyond these topical issues, and uncovers other shortcomings of the current legal system such as the lack of true participation of child victims in the decision-making process, the neglect of rehabilitative and developmental interests of victimized children, and the inherent inability of the adversarial process to seek proactively the best interests of child victims.
&#182;
The thesis further explores an alternative to the criminal justice process -- that
of restorative justice -- and examines its applicability to child victims. Unlike the
criminal justice paradigm, restorative justice fosters the equal participation of the
stakeholders (in particular victims, offenders and their communities), and focuses
on their emotional and social rehabilitation while respecting their human rights. To explore the suitability of restorative justice for child victims, five restorative justice schemes from New Zealand, Australia and Canada and their evaluation studies are reviewed. Each of these schemes has included child victims, and most of them have dealt with either sexual assaults of children or family violence and abuse. Yet each of the evaluated schemes illuminates different concerns and proposes varying strategies for meeting the needs-rights of child victims.

&#182;
While these schemes demonstrate the significant potential of restorative justice to better address the full scope of the needs and rights of child victims, they uncover emerging concerns as well. Therefore, in the last part of the thesis, the needs-rights model is used once again to derive subsidiary principles for action, to maximize the benefits of restorative justice for child victims and minimize the related risks. A complex set of needs and rights is managed by a method of grouping them into needs-rights clusters and deriving from them simple heuristics for practitioners to follow. This clustering method of needs-rights-heuristics is a methodological contribution of the research to the psychology of law.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">victims of crime</field><field name="subject">child victims</field><field name="subject">restorative justice</field><field name="subject">needs-rights</field><field name="subject">children&#146;s human rights</field><field name="subject">children&#146;s needs</field><field name="subject">adversarial criminal justice</field><field name="subject">Family Group Conference</field><field name="subject">trauma</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20061114.100521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutional safe space and shame management in workplace bullying</field><field name="creator">Shin, Hwayeon Helene</field><field name="description">This study addresses the question of how an individual&#146;s perception of the
safety of his or her institutional space impacts on shame management
skills. Shame has been widely recognised as a core emotion that can readily
take the form of anger and violence in interpersonal relationships if it is
unresolved. When shame is not acknowledged properly, feelings of shame
build up and lead to shame-rage spirals that break down social bonds
between people. Some might consider the total avoidance of shame
experiences as a way to cut the link between shame and violence. However,
there is a reason why we cannot just discard the experience of shame. Shame
is a self-regulatory emotion (Braithwaite, 1989, 2002; Ahmed et al., 2001).
If one feels shame over wrongdoing, one is less likely to re-offend in the
future. That is to say, shame is a destructive emotion on the one hand in
the way it can destroy our social bonds, but on the other hand, it is a
moral emotion that reflects capacity to regulate each other and ourselves.
This paradoxical nature of shame gives rise to the necessity of managing
shame in a socially adaptive way. A group of scholars in the field of shame
has argued that institutions can be designed in such a way that they create
safe space that allows people to feel shame and manage shame without its
adverse consequences (Ahmed et al., 2001). This means that people would
feel safe to acknowledge shame and accept the consequences of their actions
without fear of stigmatisation or the disruption of social bonds. Without
fear, there would be less likelihood of displacing shame, that is, blaming
others and expressing shame as anger towards others. The context adopted
for empirically examining shame management in this study is workplace
bullying. Bullying has become a dangerous phenomenon in our workplace that
imposes significant costs on employers, employees, their families and
industries as a whole (Einarsen et al., 2003a). Teachers belong to a
professional group that is reputed to be seriously affected by bullying at
work. Teachers from Australia and Korea completed self-report
questionnaires anonymously. Three shame management styles were identified:
shame acknowledgement, shame displacement and (shame) withdrawal. The
likely strengths of these shame management styles were investigated in
terms of three factors postulated as contributions to institutional safe
space: that is, 1) cultural value orientations, 2) the salience of
workgroup identity, and 3) problem resolution practices at work. The
present thesis suggests that further consideration should be given to
institutional interventions that support and maintain institutional safe
space and that encourage shame acknowledgement, while dampening the adverse
effect of defensive shame management. The evidence presented in this thesis
is a first step in demonstrating that institutional safe space and shame
management skills are empirically measurable, are relevant in other
cultural contexts and address issues that are at the heart of the human
condition everywhere........ [For the full Abstract, see the PDF files

The area is generally semi-arid to arid undulating to flat terrain covered by sparse vegetation.
&#182;
During the Cretaceous, an extensive sea retreated across vast plains, with rivers draining from the south and east.  After the uplift of the Great Divide associated with opening of the Tasman Sea in the Late Cretaceous, drainage swung to the west, cutting across the Darling River Lineament.  The Murray-Darling Basin depression developed as a depocentre during the Paleogene.  Climates also underwent dramatic change during the Cenozoic, from warm-humid to cooler, more seasonal climates, to the arid conditions prevalent today.  Up until now, there has been very little temporal constraint on the development of this landscape over this time period.  This study seeks to address the timing of various weathering and landscape evolution events in northwestern New South Wales.
&#182;
The application of various regolith dating methods was undertaken.  Palaeomagnetic dating, clay &#948;18O dating, (U+Th)/He and U-Pb dating were all investigated.  Palaeomagnetic and clay dating methods have been well established in Australian regolith studies for the last 30 years.  More recently, (U+Th)/He dating has been successfully trialled both overseas and in Australia.  U-Pb dating of regolith materials has not been undertaken.  Each method dates different regolith forming processes and materials.  Palaeomagnetic and clay dating were both successfully carried out for sites across northwestern New South Wales, providing a multi-technique approach to resolving the timing of weathering events.  Although (U+Th)/He dating was unsuccessful, there is scope for further refinement of the technique, and its application to regolith dating.  U-Pb dating was also unsuccessfully applied to late-stage anatase, which is a cement in many Australian silcretes.
&#182;
Results from this study indicate that the landscape evolution and weathering history of northwestern New South Wales dates back at least 60 million years, probably 100 million years, and perhaps even as far back as 180 million years.  The results imply that northwestern New South Wales was continuously sub-aerially exposed for the last 100 Ma, indicating that marine sedimentation in the Murray-Darling and Eromanga-Surat Basins was separated by this exposed region.  The ages also provide further evidence for episodic deep chemical weathering under certain climatic conditions across the region, and add to the data from across Australia for similar events.  In particular, the palaeomagnetic ages, which cluster at ~60 &#177; 10 Ma and 15 &#177; 10 Ma, are recorded in other palaeomagnetic dating studies of Australian regolith.  The clay ages are more continuous across the field area, but show older clays in the Eromanga Basin sediments at White Cliffs and Lightning Ridge, Eocene clays in the Cobar region, and Oligocene &#150; Miocene clays in the Broken Hill region, indicating progressively younger clay formation from east to west across northwestern New South Wales, in broad agreement with previously published clay weathering ages from around Australia.  
&#182;
These weathering ages can be reconciled with reconstructions of Australian climates from previously published work, which show a cooling trend over the last 40 Ma, following an extended period of high mean annual temperatures in the Paleocene and Eocene.  In conjunction with this cooling, total precipitation decreased, and rainfall became more seasonal.  The weathering ages fall within periods of wetness (clay formation), the onset of seasonal climate (clay formation and palaeomagnetic weathering ages) and the initiation of aridity in the late Miocene (palaeomagnetic weathering ages).

Subgroup size of spider monkeys in Parque Nacional Pico Bonito ranged from 1-23 (n=55) individuals, with a mean subgroup size of 6.93 &#177; 4.53 individuals, which was larger than nearly all subgroup sizes reported in Central and South America. Mean subgroup composition consisted of 1.65 &#177; 1.16 adult males, 2.67 &#177; 1.69 adult females and 1.75 &#177; 1.92 juveniles. Sex ratio of adult males to adult females was 1:1.62, which was consistent with most Central and South American Ateles studies in the literature.&#182;

Of a possible 23 identified food tree species from 15 families, and 7 unidentified tree and vine species, spider monkeys were confirmed to consume fruits, leaves and/or seeds from 8 identified tree species, 1 unidentified tree species, and 1 unidentified vine species. Several of the confirmed genera consumed by Ateles in Parque Nacional Pico Bonito were consistent with other studies conducted in Central and South America, including Dialium, Ficus, and Coccoloba.&#182;

Combining pelage analysis and discriminant analysis of cranial and dental measurements from 140 skins and 253 adult crania, the taxonomy of the Central American Ateles geoffroyi was revised to recognize the taxa Ateles geoffroyi yucatanensis, A. g. vellerosus, A. g. pan, A. g. geoffroyi, A. g. frontatus, A. g. ornatus, and A. g. grisescens, with the recognition of a potential new taxon from northern Honduras, resulting in a revised distribution of Ateles geoffroyi, based on the pelage and cranial analyses.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ateles geoffroyi</field><field name="subject">Atelidae</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Honduras</field><field name="subject">morphometric analysis</field><field name="subject">neotropical primates</field><field name="subject">pelage characteristics</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060530.114859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributed Support for Intelligent Environments</field><field name="creator">Mantoro, Teddy</field><field name="description">This thesis describes research on methods for Ubiquitous/Pervasive Computing to better
suit users in an Intelligent Environment. The approach is to create and equip a computing
environment, such as our Active Office, with technologies that can identify user needs
and meet these need in a timely, efficient and unobtrusive manner.&#182;
The critical issues in the Intelligent Environment are how to enable transparent,
distributed computing to allow continued operation across changing circumstances and
how to exploit the changing environment so that it is aware of the context of user
location, the collection of nearby people and objects, accessible devices and changes to
those objects over time.&#182;
Since the Intelligent Environment is an environment with rapid and rich computing
processing, the distributed context processing architecture (DiCPA) was developed to
manage and respond to rapidly changing aggregation of sensor data. This architecture is a
scalable distributed context processing architecture that provides: 1. continued operation
across changing circumstances for users, 2. the collection of nearby people and objects, 3.
accessible devices and 4. the changes to those objects over time in the environment. The
DiCPA approach focuses on how the Intelligent Environment provides context
information for user location, user mobility and the user activity model. Users are
assumed mobile within the Intelligent Environment and can rapidly change their access to
relevant information and the availability of communications and computational resources.&#182;
Context-Aware Computing is a new approach in software engineering for Intelligent
Environment. It is an approach in the design and construction of a context-aware
application that exploits rapid changes in access to relevant information and the
availability of communication and computing resources in the mobile computing
environment. The goal of Context-Aware Computing is to make user interaction with the
computer easier in the smart environment where technology is spread throughout
(pervasive), computers are everywhere at the same time (ubiquitous) and technology is
embedded (ambient) in the environment. Context-aware applications need not be
difficult, tedious or require the acquisition of new skills on the part of the user. They
should be safe, easy, simple to use and should enable new functionality without the need
to learn new technology. They should provide relevant information and a simple way for
a user to manage.&#182;
The Intelligent Environment requires a context-aware application to improve its
efficiency and to increase productivity and enjoyment for the user. The context awareness
mechanism has four fundamental cores i.e. identity (who), activity (what), location
(where) and timestamp (when). Based on DiCPA architecture, the model of user location
(where), user mobility (where), user activity (what) and Intelligent Environment response
(what) were developed. Prototypes were also developed to proof the Context-Aware
Computing concept in the Intelligent Environment.&#182;
An Intelligent Environment uses the multi-disciplinary area of Context-Aware
Computing, which combines technology, computer systems, models and reasoning, social
aspects, and user support. A &#147;good quality&#148; project for Context-Aware Computing
requires core content and provides iterative evaluation processes, which has two types of
iteration: design and product iteration of the evaluation. The aim of the development of
an evaluation program in Context-Aware Computing is to determine what to test, how to
test and the appropriate metrics to use. This work presents the metrics for a good quality
project in the Context-Aware Computing area, which is followed by the evaluation of the
prototypes of this work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intelligent Environment</field><field name="subject">context aware computing</field><field name="subject">ubiquitouscomputing</field><field name="subject">pervasive computing</field><field name="subject">intelligent sensors</field><field name="subject">location awareness</field><field name="subject">user mobility</field><field name="subject">user activity</field><field name="subject">intelligent responses.</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070123.150814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereoselective intramolecular Michael addition reactions of pyrrole and their application to natural product syntheses</field><field name="creator">Beck, Daniel Antony Speedie</field><field name="description">Chapter one; &#147;(-)-Rhazinilam and (-)-Rhazinal:  Alkaloids with Anti-mitotic Properties Derived from Kopsia teoi&#148;, provides the background information behind the motives that initiated this research project.  The plant alkaloid (-)-rhazinilam [(-)-1] and its naturally-occurring derivative (-)-rhazinal [(-)-13] both exhibit potent anti-mitotic activities and, as such, are interesting targets for total synthesis.  Chapter one is a review of the literature regarding these two compounds and discusses the occurrence, proposed biosynthetic origins, structural elucidation and biological activites of compound (-)-1 and that of its analogues including alkaloid (-)-13.  Previous total syntheses of these two compounds are then examined, concluding with the only reported total synthesis of compound (-)-13. Developed within the Banwell research group, this total synthesis produced the racemic modification of alkaloid (-)-13 due to a lack of any stereocontrol in the key intramolecular Michael addition step.  This unprecedented key step, involving cyclisation of the C2 of pyrrole onto an N-tethered and ?,?-disubstituted acrylate to produce a quaternary-carbon stereogenic centre, would be of greatly enhanced utility if it could be achieved in a catalytic-enantioselective fashion.  The realisation of this goal is the central aim of the research conducted within this thesis.
&#182;
Chapter two; &#147;Investigating Asymmetric Induction in the Intramolecular Michael Addition of pyrrole to N-Tethered Acrylates and Related Species&#148;, introduces the model study used to direct research towards achieving the goal of asymmetric induction in the title process.  The model is a somewhat simplified version of the original process used in the total synthesis of compound (-)-13 involving cyclisation of the C2 of pyrrole onto an N-tethered and ?-monosubstituted Michael acceptor, to produce a tertiary-carbon stereogenic centre.  This simplification allows the rapid synthesis of a broad range of potential substrates for use in the title process, thus enabling the investigation of various different approaches to inducing asymmetry therein.  High levels of asymmetric induction are observed with the use of chiral substrates or catalysts, facilitating the synthesis of both 6- and 7-membered rings annulated to pyrrole with construction of the relevant tertiary-carbon stereogenic centre in enantio-enriched form.  For the reactions producing a 6-membered ring annulated to pyrrole, unambiguous proof of the absolute sense of asymmetric induction observed in the intramolecular Michael addition event is established using a chemical correlation study involving elaboration of a key indolizine-type cyclisation product, to the plant alkaloid of known absolute stereochemistry, (-)-tashiromine [(-)-75]. For the reaction producing a 7-membered ring annulated to pyrrole, the same information is obtained via X-ray crystallographic analyses of a dibrominated derivative of a key pyrroloazepine-type cyclisation product.
&#182;
Chapter three &#147;An Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Alkaloid (-)-Rhazinal:  An Anti-mitotic Agent Isolated from Kopsia teoi.&#148;, focuses on the application of methodology developed in the previous chapter, to the original goal of inducing asymmetry in the intramolecular Michael addition reaction, involving cyclisation of the C2 of pyrrole onto an N-tethered and ?,?-disubstituted acrylate to produce a quaternary-carbon stereogenic centre. This is ultimately achieved in a catalytic-enantioselective fashion, resulting in the first such total synthesis of the anti-mitotic alkaloid (-)-rhazinal [(-)-13].

The acquisition in an enantioselective manner, of an intermediate previously obtained in racemic form, en route to the racemic modification of the natural product (&#177;)-aspidospermidine [(&#177;)-134],  constitutes  a  formal  and  enantioselective  total  synthesis  of (+)-aspidospermidine 
[(+)-134].  
The direct deformylation of (-)-rhazinal [(-)-13], is carried out,  to  produce  the  parent  alkaloid 
(-)-rhazinilam [(-)-1].  
The pyrrole ring present in (-)-rhazinilam [(-)-1] is oxidised, to produce the related natural product (-)-Leuconolam [(-)-12] which has not, hitherto, been prepared by total synthesis.

Bolte, Askin and the Post-War Ascendancy</field><field name="creator">Abjorensen, Norman</field><field name="description">The formation of the Liberal Party of Australia in the mid-1940s heralded a new effort to stem the tide of government regulation that had grown with Labor Party rule in the latter years of World War II and immediately after.   It was not until 1949 that the party gained office at Federal level, beginning what was to be a record unbroken term of 23 years, but its efforts faltered at State level in Victoria, where the party was divided, and in New South Wales, where Labor was seemingly entrenched.   The fortunes were reversed with the rise to leadership of men who bore a different stamp to their predecessors, and were in many ways atypical Liberals: Henry Bolte in Victoria and Robin Askin in New South Wales.   Bolte, a farmer, and Askin, a bank officer, had served as non-commissioned officers in World War II and rose to lead parties whose members who had served in the war were predominantly of the officer class.   In each case, their man management skills put an end to division and destabilisation in their parties, and they went on to serve record terms as Liberal leaders in their respective States, Bolte 1955-72 and Askin 1965-75.  Neither was ever challenged in their leadership and each chose the time and nature of his departure from politics, a rarity among Australian political leaders.   Their careers are traced here in the context of the Liberal revival and the heightened expectations of the post-war years when the Liberal Party reached an ascendancy, governing for a brief time in 1969-70 in all Australian States as well as the Commonwealth.   Their leadership is also examined in the broader context of leadership in the Liberal Party, and also in the ways in which the new party sought to engage with and appeal to a wider range of voters than had traditionally been attracted to the non-Labor parties.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liberal Party of Australia</field><field name="subject">political leadership</field><field name="subject">Sir Henry Bolte</field><field name="subject">Sir Robert Askin</field><field name="subject">Australian States</field><field name="subject">Australian Commonwealth</field><field name="subject">state governments</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">post-war years</field><field name="subject">Liberal revival</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070320.122842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of the Ethnography of Knowledge through an Organisational Ethnography of ActewAGL</field><field name="creator">Dalitz, Tracey Leanne</field><field name="description">This thesis develops and empirically tests the method of the Ethnography of Knowledge in the context of an ethnographic study of the Logistics Branch of ActewAGL, an Australian multi-utility company.
&#182;
The study is based on fieldwork undertaken over an eight and a half month period of participant observation and uses a grounded style of analysis.
&#182;
In trying to understand the knowledge underpinning the social construction of a particular aspect of the field site I have used a confessional ethnographic approach. After analysing and coding the data I then assign knowledge taxonomies to the ethnographic account to understand the knowledge underpinning the social situation. I have called this method the Ethnography of Knowledge. The Ethnography of Knowledge does not follow a piece of knowledge through an organisation or attempt to understand the organisation&#146;s knowledge but uses knowledge as a tool to understand the social construction of the setting, not as the focus itself. The thesis then explores where, when and how the Ethnography of Knowledge is useful in relation to four significant themes from the data; routines, in/formal, change and power.
&#182;
The contributions of the thesis are primarily methodological (the Ethnography of Knowledge), secondarily locational (Australia and ActewAGL) with some incidental theoretical contributions related to the data chapters. The thesis also contributes and assessment of the applicability of viewing various theoretical constructs as knowledge-based. Methodologically, my main contribution is to use participant observation and then in the analysis phase to assign knowledge taxonomies to the ethnographic account in order to gain a greater understanding of the socially constructed knowledge underpinning the actions in the social setting. I then empirically test how useful the application of this method is in relation to the various themes that form the basis of my data chapters. Through testing the method, this study confirms that whilst knowledge is a useful methodological tool in enhancing understanding of the certain aspect of the organisational social setting, it is not equally in all situations. When aspects of the social setting are knowledge-based or locally observable, such as routines and in/formal, the Ethnography of Knowledge is very useful in enhancing an understanding. However as one moves to a more macro view of the organisation, away from the initiation of actions, such as in organisational change or power, the Ethnography of Knowledge is less useful.
&#182;
Locationally I contribute a new site and add to the sparse Australian organisational ethnographic literature. In each chapter I provide incidental theoretical contributions in an ethnographic and empirical study of each particular construct. Most significantly, I am the first to test routines theory as a full participant in organisational routines, adding problem-solving as a characteristic. I also develop and use a model for understanding and analysing how the formal and informal aspects of organisations act and interact in getting things done.

PECVD for Silicon-based Photonics</field><field name="creator">Spooner, Marc</field><field name="description">This thesis presents results on the applications and limitations of plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition for silicon-based photonics, with an emphasis on optical microcavities for the control of light emission from silicon nanocrystals. 
&#182;
Silicon nanocrystals were formed by precipitation and growth within Si-rich oxide layers (SiOx) deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition. The films were found to exhibit strong room temperature photoluminescence, with the optimum emission depending
on the composition and processing of the films. The strongest emission was achieved for films with a silicon content of ~40%, following hydrogen passivation. Hydrogen was introduced into the samples by two different methods: by annealing in forming gas (95% N2: 5% H2) or by annealing with a hydrogenated silicon nitride capping layer. Both methods caused an increase in photoluminescence intensity due to the passivation of defects. In contrast, the presence of low levels of iron and gold were shown to reduce the concentration of luminescent nanocrystals due to the creation of  non-radiative centres.
&#182;
Optical microcavity structures containing silicon nanocrystals were also fabricated by Plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition, using silicon dioxide, silicon nitride and silicon-rich oxide layers. The microcavities consisted of a silicon-rich oxide layer between two distributed Bragg reflectors formed of alternating silicon dioxide/nitride layers. The optical emission from these and related structures were examined and compared with that from individual layers in the structure. This revealed a complex interplay between  defect and nanocrystal luminescence, hydrogen passivation and materials structure. The resulting microcavity structures were shown to be suitable for producing a stop-band over the wavelength range of interest for nanocrystal emission, 500-1000nm, and to produce significant intensity enhancement and spectral narrowing. Quality factors of 50-200 were demonstrated.
&#182;
The application of plasma deposited films was shown to be limited by  stress-induced failure that resulted in cracking and delamination of the films during annealing. The SiOx films thicker than about 600nm failed predominantly by cracking. This was shown to be caused by tensile stress in the film caused by hydrogen desorption during high temperature annealing. The resulting cracks showed preferred alignment depending on the crystallographic orientation of the silicon substrate. For films deposited on (100) silicon, two modes of crack propagation were observed, straight cracks aligned along &lt; 100&gt; directions, and wavy cracks aligned along &lt; 110&gt; directions. For films deposited on (110) silicon, straight cracks were observed along [-1 10] directions, with a lesser number aligned along [001] directions. Cracks were also observed for films on (111) silicon. These showed
3-fold symmetry consistent with crack propagation along &lt; 211&gt; directions due to plastic deformation. Details of these crack geometries and their dependencies are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silicon photonics</field><field name="subject">nanocrystals</field><field name="subject">PECVD</field><field name="subject">cracks</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070315.043442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hemispheric interaction: when and why is yours better than mine?</field><field name="creator">Cherbuin, Nicolas</field><field name="description">The performance of most tasks requires some interaction between the cerebral hemispheres. Despite this fact, research has focused on demonstrating that each hemisphere is specialised for certain processes and has largely neglected this interaction. 
&#182;
Recent research has recognised the need for a better understanding of how resources are shared between the cerebral hemispheres. While these studies have shed light on factors external to the participants being tested, such as the type of task and stimuli used, presentation times, and different measurement methods, they have neglected variables that differ between individuals. The studies reported here focused on factors internal to the participants. They include sex, age, handedness, functional lateralisation, practice, attention, and hemispheric activation, which vary between individuals or within individuals across time, and have been shown to influence the structure and morphology of the corpus callosum which is the main pathway for hemispheric interactions.
&#182;
This thesis examines the relationship of these variables to the efficiency of hemispheric interactions.
&#182;
A literature review of the factors affecting hemispheric interactions and interhemispheric transfer is presented in Chapter 1, and methodological issues relating to the measurement of these variables in Chapter 2. Based upon this research, two tasks, the Poffenberger paradigm and a letter-matching task, were selected to assess interhemispheric transfer time and hemispheric interactions, respectively, and to investigate the relationship between these two variables.
&#182;
Chapters 3 and 4 present the findings of the principal study, using a large sample of participants and regression analysis, which demonstrate that both faster interhemispheric transfer and more extreme left-handedness are associated with greater efficiency of hemispheric interaction. Surprisingly, other factors which were expected to influence hemispheric interactions (age, sex, functional lateralisation, and attention) did not have a significant effect on this variable. 
&#182;
A strong practice effect found in the task used in Chapters 3 and 4 is analysed in Chapter 5. Contrary to previous findings, this practice effect seems not to be due to a shift from sequential, rule-based processing to memory-retrieval, but rather, is a more general practice effect consistent with progressively more efficient use of neural resources.
&#182;
Chapter 6 shows that individuals with dyslexia not only demonstrate an abnormally fast interhemispheric transfer, but also attentional deficits, due probably to decreased efficiency in hemispheric interactions. Because some clinical populations, such as individuals with dyslexia, have been shown to have hemispheric interaction deficits, the study of such clinical samples can provide valuable information about the relationship between hemispheric interactions and other individual variables. 
&#182;
In Chapter 7 it is demonstrated that both latent and induced patterns of lateralised hemispheric activation affect hemispheric interactions. This suggests that assessment of hemispheric activation is important not only in this field, but probably also more generally in neuropsychological research. These findings highlight the need for a simple, inexpensive measure of hemispheric activation that can be applied routinely in cognitive experiments. 
&#182;
Chapter 8 presents a new technique to measure lateralised brain activation in typical psychological experiments using functional tympanic membrane thermometry (fTMT). This measure relies on the measurement of ear membrane temperature as an index of hemispheric activation. The technique is simple and inexpensive, and is shown to be suitable for the assessment of hemispheric activation patterns during typical experiments.
&#182;
In conclusion, individual characteristics such as the efficiency of interhemispheric transfer, handedness, functional lateralisation, attention, and hemispheric activation are important factors to consider when researching hemispheric interactions in both normal and clinical populations. Furthermore, future research will benefit from this newly developed measure, fTMT, by allowing the systematic study of the effects of hemispheric activation in brain processes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hemispheric interactions</field><field name="subject">interhemispheric transfer</field><field name="subject">corpus callosum</field><field name="subject">functional lateralisation</field><field name="subject">individual variability</field><field name="subject">handedness</field><field name="subject">practice</field><field name="subject">hemispheric activation</field><field name="subject">ear temperature</field><field name="subject">dyslexia</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20060317.135525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstructing linguistic history in a dialect continuum: The Kamta, Rajbanshi, and Northern Deshi Bangla subgroup of Indo-Aryan</field><field name="creator">Toulmin, Matthew William Stirling</field><field name="description">This study outlines a methodological framework for reconstructing linguistic history within a dialect continuum and applies this methodology to an under-described, controversial, and complex subgroup of New Indo-Aryan (NIA)&#151;the Kamta, Rajbanshi and Northern Deshi Bangla lects (KRNB).
&#182;
Dialect continua are characterised by non-discrete boundaries between speech communities, and as a result previously divergent lects may undergo common innovations; the result is the familiar picture of overlapping dialectological isoglosses. The sequencing of these innovations and the historical relations between the lects involved are often highly ambiguous. Given the right sociohistorical conditions, a widespread innovation may be more recent than a localised innovation&#151;the very opposite sequencing to that implied by the splits in a family tree.
&#182;
Not surprisingly, discrete application to the NIA continuum of traditional methodologies&#151;including the Comparative Method, etymological reconstruction and dialect geography&#151;has yielded unsatisfactory and at times chronologically distorted results. Historical studies, therefore, have chosen between: (a) only studying the histories of NIA lects with written records; (b) reconstructing using the chronology suggested by the shape of a family tree; or (c) settling for a &#145;flat&#146;, non-historical account of dialect geography.
&#182;
Under the approach developed here, the strengths of each of these traditional methods are synthesised within an overarching framework provided by a sociohistorical theory of language change. This synthesis enables the linguistic history of the KRNB lects to be reconstructed with some detail from the proto-Kamta stage (1250-1550 AD) up to the present day. Innovations are sequenced based on three types of criteria: linguistic, textual and sociohistorical. The old Kamta stage, and its relation to old Bangla and Asamiya, is reconstructed based on linguistic Propagation Events and Speech Community Events&#151;two concepts central to the methodology. The old Kamta speech community and its language became divided into western, central and eastern subsections during the middle KRNB period (1550-1787 AD, dates assigned by attested sociohistorical events). During the same period, KRNB lects also underwent partial reintegration with NIA lects further afield by means of more widely propagated changes. This trend of differentiation at a local level, concurrent with reintegration at a wider level, also characterises the modern KRNB period from 1787 AD to the present.
&#182;
This account of KRNB linguistic history is based on a rigorous reconstruction of changes in phonology and morphology. The result is not only a reconstruction of historical changes, but of the proto-Kamta phoneme inventory, hundreds of words of vocabulary, and specific areas of nominal and verbal morphology. The reconstruction is based on data collected in the field for the purposes of this study. Phonological reconstruction has made use of the WordCorr software program, and the reconstructed vocabulary is presented in a comparative wordlist in an appendix.
&#182;
The methodology developed and applied in this study has been found highly successful; though naturally not without its own limitations. This study has significance for its contribution both to the methodology of historical linguistic reconstruction and to the light shed on the linguistic prehistory of KRNB.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">historical linguistics</field><field name="subject">sociohistorical linguistics</field><field name="subject">dialectology</field><field name="subject">comparative method</field><field name="subject">Indo-Aryan</field><field name="subject">Rajbanshi</field><field name="subject">Kamta</field><field name="subject">Deshi Bhasha</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070411.000201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Institutional Capacity
of Local Government Agencies in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Imbaruddin, Amir</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the capacity of local government agencies in Makassar (Indonesia) to provide services to the public. Besides aiming to understand the institutional capacity of local government agencies, the research also examines the role internal and external factors play in determining the service delivery capacity of public organisations. Internal factors refer to the organisational structure, managerial practices and the management of human resources in public organisations. External factors refer to the degree of bureaucratic and political accountability as well as the level of competition experienced by government agencies.
&#182;
This research will enrich the existing development literature by strengthening our understanding of the ways in which internal and external factors strengthen or weaken the capacity of public sector institutions.
&#182;
Institutional capacity is measured by the quality of services provided by the local government agencies as assessed by their clients through both questionnaires and interviews, whereas the data regarding the role internal and external factors play in determining the institutional capacity of local government agencies were collected by in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with the management and staff in a number of agencies, with high-level bureaucrats, with non-government organisations and business associations, and members of the Makassar parliament.
&#182;
This study concludes that the institutional capacity of local government agencies in the case studies varies, although overall institutional capacity is relatively low or unsatisfactory. Of the four agencies in the case studies, only one agency was able to deliver quality services higher than the level expected by its clients.
&#182;
In general, this research reveals that the degree of accountability of the local government agencies in the case studies is relatively weak. The study infers that the degree of accountability does not have a significant impact on the agencies' performance.

It was found that the competitive or monopolistic environment in which the local government agencies operate does affect the capacity of the agencies to serve their clients. This capacity is also affected by a number of aspects within the organisation and human resource dimensions of the agencies. 
&#182;
This study shows that, in the case of Indonesia, attempts to improve the capacity of government agencies to deliver quality public services by improving the capacity of parliament to politically oversee the executive, as recommended by a number of international agencies and commentators, may not be the best and most effective alternative. Rather than focusing the resources to improve the degree of political accountability, the study suggests that a more effective strategy to develop the capacity of government agencies is to enhance the organisational structure, managerial practices and the management of human resources in the public organizations, and to introduce competition into the delivery of public services.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Makassar</field><field name="subject">local government agencies</field><field name="subject">institutional capacity</field><field name="subject">service delivery capability</field><field name="subject">public organisations</field><field name="subject">accountability</field><field name="subject">competition</field><field name="subject">public sector institutions</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070320.141727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The hydrological flux of organic carbon at the catchment scale: a case study in the Cotter River catchment, Australia</field><field name="creator">Sabetraftar, Karim</field><field name="description">Existing terrestrial carbon accounting models have mainly investigated atmosphere-vegetationsoil
stocks and fluxes but have largely ignored the hydrological flux of organic carbon. It is
generally assumed that biomass and soil carbon are the only relevant pools in a landscape
ecosystem. However, recent findings have suggested that significant amounts of organic carbon
can dissolve (dissolved organic carbon or DOC) or particulate (particulate organic carbon or
POC) in water and enter the hydrological flux at the catchment scale. A significant quantity of
total organic carbon (TOC) sequestered through photosynthesis may be exported from the
landscape through the hydrological flux and stored in downstream stocks.&#182;
This thesis presents a catchment-scale case study investigation into the export of organic carbon
through a river system in comparison with carbon that is produced by vegetation through
photosynthesis. The Cotter River Catchment was selected as the case study. It is a forested
catchment that experienced a major wildfire event in January 2003. The approach is based on an
integration of a number of models. The main input data were time series of in-stream carbon
measurements and remotely sensed vegetation greenness. The application of models to
investigate diffuse chemical substances has dramatically increased in the past few years because
of the significant role of hydrology in controlling ecosystem exchange. The research firstly
discusses the use of a hydrological simulation model (IHACRES) to analyse organic carbon
samples from stream and tributaries in the Cotter River Catchment case study. The IHACRES
rainfall-runoff model and a regionalization method are used to estimate stream-flow for the 75
sub-catchments. The simulated streamflow data were used to calculate organic carbon loads
from concentrations sampled at five locations in the catchment.&#182;
The gross primary productivity (GPP) of the vegetation cover in the catchment was estimated
using a radiation use efficiency (RUE) model driven by MODIS TERRA data on vegetation
greenness and modeled surface irradiance (RS). The relationship between total organic carbon
discharged in-stream and total carbon uptake by plants was assessed using a cross-correlation
analysis.&#182;
The IHACRES rainfall-runoff model was successfully calibrated at three gauged sites and
performed well. The results of the calibration procedure were used in the regionalization method
that enabled streamflow to be estimated at ungauged locations including the seven sampling
sites and the 75 sub-catchment areas. The IHACRES modelling approach was found appropriate
for investigating a wide range of issues related to the hydrological export of organic carbon at

the catchment scale. A weekly sampling program was implemented to provide estimates of
TOC, DOC and POC concentrations in the Cotter River Catchment between July 2003 and June
2004. The organic carbon load was estimated using an averaging method.&#182;

The rate of photosynthesis by vegetation (GPP) was successfully estimated using the radiation
use efficiency model to discern general patterns of vegetation productivity at sub-catchment
scales. This analysis required detailed spatial resolution of the GPP across the entire catchment
area (comprising 75 sub-catchment areas) in addition to the sampling locations. Important
factors that varied at the catchment scale during the sampling period July 2003 &#150; June 2004,
particularly the wildfire impacts, were also considered in this assessment.
&#182;
The results of the hydrologic modelling approach and terrestrial GPP outcome were compared
using cross correlation and regression analysis. This comparison revealed the likely proportion
of catchment GPP that contributes to in-stream hydrological flux of organic carbon. TOC Load
was 0.45% of GPP and 22.5 - 25% of litter layer. As a result of this investigation and giving due
consideration to the uncertainties in the approach, it can be concluded that the hydrological flux
of organic carbon in a forested catchment is a function of gross primary productivity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">terrestrial carbon</field><field name="subject">hydrological flux</field><field name="subject">organic carbon</field><field name="subject">DOC</field><field name="subject">dissolved organic carbon</field><field name="subject">POC</field><field name="subject">particulate organic carbon</field><field name="subject">catchment scale</field><field name="subject">Cotter River Catchment</field><field name="subject">IHACRES</field><field name="subject">hydrological simulation model</field><field name="subject">GPP photosynthesis by vegetation</field><field name="subject">forested catchment</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070502.141450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transportation and Homeric Epic</field><field name="creator">Power, Michael O'Neill</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of transportation &#151; the phenomenon of &#147;being miles away&#148; while receiving a narrative &#151; on audience response.

The ways in which transportation complements and extends some concepts of narrative reception familiar to Homeric studies (the Epic Illusion, Vividness, and Enchantment) are considered, as are the ways in which the psychological theories might be adjusted to accommodate Homeric epic. A major claim is drawn from these theories that
transportation fundamentally affects the audience&#146;s interpretation of and responses to the narrative; this claim is tested both theoretically and empirically in terms of ambiguous characterization of Odysseus and the Kykl&#333;ps Polyph&#275;mos in

applications to electric double layers</field><field name="creator">Meige, Albert</field><field name="description">Inductive plasmas are simulated by using a one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation including Monte Carlo collision techniques (pic/mcc). To model inductive heating, a non-uniform radio-frequency (rf) electric field, perpendicular to the electron motion is included into the classical particle-in-cell scheme. The inductive plasma pic simulation is used to confirm recent experimental results that electric double layers can form in current-free plasmas. These results differ from previous experimental or simulation systems where the double layers are driven by a current or by imposed potential differences. The formation of a super-sonic ion beam, resulting from the ions accelerated through the potential drop of the double layer and predicted by the pic simulation is confirmed with nonperturbative laser-induced fluorescence measurements of ion flow. It is shown that at low pressure, where the electron mean free path is of the order of, or greater than the system length, the electron energy distribution function (eedf) is close to Maxwellian, except for its tail which is depleted at energies higher than the plasma potential. Evidence supporting that this depletion is mostly due to the high-energy electrons escaping to the walls is given. 
&#182;
A new hybrid simulation scheme (particle ions and Boltzmann/particle electrons), accounting for non-Maxwellian eedf and self-consistently simulating low-pressure high-density plasmas at low computational cost is proposed. Results obtained with the &#147;improved&#148; hybrid model are in much better agreement with the full pic simulation than the classical non self-consistent hybrid model. This model is used to simulate electronegative plasmas and to provide evidence supporting the fact that propagating double layers may spontaneously form in electronegative plasmas. It is shown that critical parameters of the simulation were very much aligned with critical parameters of the experiment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plasma</field><field name="subject">current-free double layer</field><field name="subject">particle-in-cell simulation</field><field name="subject">stochastic heating</field><field name="subject">electronegative double layer</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070111.002333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Torres Strait Islanders and Autonomy: a Borderline Case</field><field name="creator">Arthur, William Stewart</field><field name="description">During 1996 and 1997 an Australian parliamentary committee conducted an inquiry into greater autonomy for Torres Strait Islanders, but by 2000 the future of the issue seemed unclear. This thesis explores what the notion of autonomy has meant for Torres Strait and for Torres Strait Islanders in the past, and what it might mean in the future. The thesis uses material from the period before European contact to just after the end of the parliamentary inquiry.
&#182;
Several analytical tools were utilised to explore the concept of autonomy. Major among these to propose and then analyse the relationship between autonomy&#146;s economic and political components. The thesis also introduces the paired concepts of negative and positive autonomy to provide a counterpoint to ideas of welfare colonialism. Cross cutting these economic and political elements is a consideration of both regional and corporate forms of autonomy. The thesis argues that it is necessary to consider the factors which people can use to legitimise a case for autonomy and these are identified and discussed.
&#182;
Although previous research and historical material are utilised, unique parts of the thesis include an analysis of: the formal submissions and hearings associated with the parliamentary inquiry; the Torres Strait&#146;s location between Australia and Papua New Guinea; and the Strait&#146;s small-island make-up. In this latter regard, comparisons are made with models and examples of autonomy found in small island states and territories in the Pacific.
&#182;
The findings include that we must consider two groups of Torres Strait Islanders, those in Torres Strait and those on mainland Australia. Whereas those in the Strait have been able to legitimise a case for a form of autonomy those on the mainland have not. Islanders in the Strait have achieved a degree of regional autonomy; those on the mainland are unable to make a case to be part of this regional autonomy, or to achieve a form of corporate autonomy. The status of Islanders in the Strait is influenced by several factors including the Strait&#146;s location on the border with Papua New Guinea, the associated Treaty with that country, and the nature and the accessibility of the in-shore fishery. A major finding however is that although Islanders have achieved a degree of regional political autonomy, which may be progressed yet further, they have been unable to embrace non-Indigenous people within this. Their present aspiration for regional political autonomy therefore is limited to one that would apply only to Indigenous-specific affairs. This stands in some conflict with their aspiration for regional economic autonomy which would include their control over the entire regional fishery which they presently share with non-Islanders.
&#182;
Though Islanders have achieved some degree of political autonomy, they depend on substantial government financial transfers to the region. Despite this they have also achieved some economic autonomy, particularly through being involved in the region&#146;s fishery. Juxtaposing negative and positive autonomy with political and economic autonomy shows that a dependence on government economic transfers does not preclude gains in political autonomy. This can be contrasted with the notion of welfare colonialism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Torres Straits</field><field name="subject">Torres Strait Islanders</field><field name="subject">political and economic autonomy</field><field name="subject">Torres Strait Treaty</field><field name="subject">small island</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070612.114556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Function and Evolution of Putative Odorant Carriers in the Honey Bee (Apis mellifera)</field><field name="creator">Foret, Sylvain</field><field name="description">The remarkable olfactory power of insect species is thought to be generated by a combinatorial action of G-protein-coupled olfactory receptors (ORs) and olfactory carriers. Two such carrier gene families are found in insects: the odorant binding proteins (OBPs) and the chemosensory proteins (CSPs). In olfactory sensilla, OBPs and CSPs are believed to deliver hydrophobic air-borne molecules to ORs, but their expression in non-olfactory tissues suggests that they also may function as general carriers in other developmental and physiological processes.
&#182;
   Bioinformatics and experimental approaches were used to characterise the OBP and CSP gene families in a highly social insect, the western honey bee (Apis mellifera). Comparison with other insects reveals that the honey bee has the smallest set of these genes, consisting of only 21 OBPs and 6 CSPs. These numbers stand in stark contrast to the 66 OBPs and 7 CSPs in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the 46 OBPs and 20 CSPs in the beetle Tribolium castaneum. The genes belonging to both families are often organised in clusters, and evolve by lineage specic expansions. Positive selection has been found to play a role in generating a greater sequence diversication in the OBP family in contrast to the CSP gene family that is more conserved, especially in the binding pocket. Expression proling under a wide range of conditions shows that, in the honey, bee only a minority of these genes are antenna-specic. The remaining genes are expressed either ubiquitously, or are tightly regulated in specialized tissues or during development. These findings support the view that OBPs and CSPs are not restricted to olfaction, and are likely to be involved in broader physiological functions.
&#182;
   Finally, the detailed expression study and the functional characterization of a member of the CSP family, uth (unable-to-hatch), is reported. This gene is expressed in a maternal-zygotic fashion, and is restricted to the egg and embryo. Blocking the zygotic expression of uth with double-stranded RNA causes abnormalities in all body parts where this gene is highly expressed.
The treated embryos are `unable-to-hatch' and cannot progress to the larval stages. Our ndings reveal a novel, essential role for this gene family and suggest that uth is an ectodermal gene involved in embryonic cuticle formation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Olfaction</field><field name="subject">Odorant Binding Proteins</field><field name="subject">OBP</field><field name="subject">OBPs</field><field name="subject">Chemosensory proteins</field><field name="subject">CSP</field><field name="subject">CSPs</field><field name="subject">insects</field><field name="subject">bee</field><field name="subject">honeybee</field><field name="subject">honey bee</field><field name="subject">chemosensation</field><field name="subject">embryonic development</field><field name="subject">molecular evolution</field><field name="subject">protein families</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070613.144745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Groundwater balance modelling with Darcy's Law</field><field name="creator">Welsh, Wendy Denise</field><field name="description">The sustainability of groundwater resources is important for the environment, the economy and communities where surface water is scarce. It is a hidden resource, but additional information can be extracted by combining groundwater measurements and lithological information with groundwater flow equations in groundwater models. The models convert data and knowledge about the groundwater systems into information, such as relative inflow and outflow rates and water-level predictions that can be readily understood by groundwater managers. 
&#182;
The development of models to effectively inform groundwater management policies is, however, a complex task that presents a fundamental scientific challenge. This thesis presents methods and results for water balances calculated using groundwater flow models. Groundwater flow modelling methods and approaches are discussed, and their capabilities and limitations are reviewed. Two groundwater systems are studied for the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) and for the irrigation area near Bowen, Queensland. Three approaches to water balance modelling are applied in comprehensive model-development frameworks that take into account model objectives, data and knowledge availability and sensitivity analysis techniques. The three models show numerical methods of increasing complexity. The Bowen study area is well-suited to the least-complex method because data collection has been a priority there. As a contrast, the GAB is a large, poorly-monitored basin for which more knowledge of the groundwater system can be gained from its simulation by the steady state and transient groundwater flow models. The Bowen impact assessment model calculates dynamic historical water balances. The GAB aquifer models are high-complexity representations of the groundwater system that include predicted responses of the system to changes in hydrological conditions. These are comprehensive and well-documented attempts to model these systems. They provide a platform for scenario investigation and future improvements. 
&#182;
Darcy&#146;s Law was used in a GIS (Geographic Information System) to calculate dynamic water balances for an aquifer near the Queensland town of Bowen. This is the first time this approach has been applied to generate a complete groundwater balance. Over the period 1989-1997 the model estimates average total inflows to be 87 % groundwater recharge by rainfall and irrigation return flow, 12 % river recharge and 1 % inflow across the study area boundary. Outflows are estimated to be 66 % evapotranspiration, 28 % water bore discharge, 4 % discharge to the ocean and 2 % groundwater loss to rivers. Analyses show that evapotranspiration is the most uncertain parameter value. The GIS method was found to be useful for calculating water balances more accurately than analytical methods, because of their simplifying assumptions, and less time consuming than the more complex numerical models developed for the GAB aquifer. 
&#182;
For the GAB, a steady state numerical model was developed and tested and predictive scenarios were run. The purpose of this modelling was both to gain a better understanding of the water balance of the GAB and to provide a tool that could predict water level recoveries under different bore rehabilitation scenarios. The model complexity is greater than in any previous numerical groundwater model of the GAB. In particular, the model uses more data, extends over a larger area and uses a generally finer discretisation than previous models. For the nearest surface artesian aquifer in 1960 the model estimates total inflows to be 60 % groundwater recharge and 40 % diffuse vertical inter-aquifer leakage. The model estimates outflows to be 53 % diffuse vertical leakage, 43 % water bore discharge, 3 % spring discharge and 1 % discharge to the ocean. Analyses show that the model is most sensitive to changes in horizontal hydraulic conductivity and recharge. The model-predicted heads match field measurements with a Scaled RMS error of 0.8 %, which is well within the guideline error of 5 %. The predictive scenarios show net vertical leakage into the aquifer decreasing and net vertical leakage out of the aquifer increasing, as bore flows are reduced. These estimates of inflows and outflows complement other studies of the Basin and add to our understanding of its hydrodynamics. In this way the water balance helps provide a sound basis for the development of GAB groundwater management plans and policies. Through its water level recovery predictions, the model has also been used to support the GAB Sustainability Initiative. 
&#182;
A transient numerical model of the GAB was also developed and tested, and predictive scenarios were run. This model builds on the steady state model, and is more complex, with a calibration period (1965-1999) that is longer than in any previous GAB model. During calibration the model observations were expressed and weighted so that the minimisation of the objective function reflected the relative importance of the model&#146;s potential uses, these being respectively: to simulate the impact of changing bore flows, to more generally inform water management plans and to provide an estimate of the water balance. It was found that the 1960 steady state assumption was not correct. Discluding anthropogenic discharge, the model is most sensitive to recharge and hydraulic conductivity. The model-predicted heads match field measurements with a Scaled RMS error of 2.7 %, which is well within the guideline error of 5 %, but the increased data requirements of the transient model highlighted deficiencies in the data available for the modelling. In particular, the uneven spread of the groundwater measurements over both time and space, the questionable accuracy of measurements from both high temperature and pressure bores, and corroded bores, and the type of discharge measured (for example, maximum yield or flow-as-found), became evident during the calibration of the model. Insights and the value of this work indicates for the first time that at the start of 2005 outflows were estimated to exceed inflows by 266 GL/year, or 62 % of total inflows, and, assuming that inflows through the aquifer&#146;s boundary will not be reduced due to climate change, it will be possible to recover some of the lost groundwater pressure if all stock and domestic bores are rehabilitated and new extractions are limited. In this case the modelling estimates that inflows could exceed outflows by up to 40 % of total outflows.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">numerical modelling</field><field name="subject">Great Artesian Basin</field><field name="subject">Darcy's Law</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070703.165654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#145;To Take Each Other&#146; : Bugis Practices of Gender, Sexuality and Marriage</field><field name="creator">Idrus, Nurul Ilmi</field><field name="description">This thesis is an ethnography of Bugis marriage. It is concerned with aspects of gender, sexuality and marriage in a bilateral, highly competitive, hierarchical society.  
&#182;
I examine the fundamental concept of siri&#146; in relation to gender socialisation, courtship, the importance of kinship and status in marriage, how sexuality is regulated between the sexes, sex within marriage, and the dynamics of marriage, divorce, and reconciliation. The analysis considers how Islam combines with local custom (adat) in everyday practices, and how Bugis cultural specificities are affected within the national ideology of contemporary Indonesia.	
&#182;
This ethnography explores an interpretation of Bugis social and sexual experience through examination of the construction of gender identities and how they are manifested in marriage. The thesis explores the complementarity of gender for the Bugis. Despite the ideal of feminine passivity, I demonstrate that women exercise agency in a number of circumstances, including how they manage the sexuality of their husbands, defending siri&#146;, the arrangement of marriage, remarrying, money management, divorce, and violent situations. I also examine the practices of illegal marriage (kawin liar) and illegal divorce (cerai liar) at local and personal levels. I analyse local and national debates on the legitimation of what is popularly known in Indonesia as &#145;marriage based on religion&#146; (nikah secara agama) as part of the examination of Bugis marriage and marital relations.
&#182;
My thesis contributes to the understanding of Bugis notions of sexuality, gender and social location, and how these interact with siri&#146;. I explore how and why violence occurs within marriage.

Australia, 1981 to 2001</field><field name="creator">Baxter, Jennifer Anne</field><field name="description">The employment rate of young partnered women and partnered mothers increased considerably over the 1980s, while there was less change in the 1990s. This thesis explores these changes, with a focus on partnered mothers with young children. The objectives are to describe what the changes in female employment were, and to analyse why they might have occurred.  
&#182;
The analyses were primarily quantitative, although they were put into context with extensive reviews of Australian and, where relevant, international literature. The primary source of data was Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census data. Other data used included those from the ABS Child Care Surveys, Negotiating the Life Course Survey and the National Social Science Survey.  
&#182;
Many changes in maternal employment were identified. The most notable change was the increase in the number and proportion of partnered mothers working part- time hours. Job characteristics also changed, with these women in full-time or part- time jobs more likely to be working in higher skilled professional and para- professional jobs in 2001, compared to 1981. For partnered mothers with a child aged less than one, the proportion working increased, but there was also evidence that more women were making use of maternity leave.  
&#182;
Coinciding with these changes were a number of compositional changes, as women of succeeding birth cohorts were more educated, and more likely to delay marriage and childbearing. Attitudinal change was also evident, as people became more accepting of working wives. Attitudes to working mothers with young children changed less, with a strong preference for mothers to be at home when their children were young. Also over this period, there were many changes in infrastructure, policy and the labour market generally that had impacts on female employment opportunities and conditions. These changes are explored in detail, and their relationship to employment change examined. 
&#182;
Because there were so many changes in these factors occurring over this period, the exact causes of employment change were difficult to identify. Also, an analysis of employment change is complicated because the causality of certain effects does not run in only one direction &#150; there are more complex links between education, childbearing and employment that should be accounted for in explaining changes over time. Similarly, changes in supply of labour are difficult to disentangle from changes in demand for labour.
&#182; 
Compositional changes were certainly important in explaining the growth in the proportion working, especially for younger women. These women were not only more highly educated in 2001, they were less likely to have children. For working mothers, the effect of increased education levels could be seen in the greater numbers working in higher status occupations.  
&#182;
The analyses of infrastructure and policy change, particularly that of changes in income support and child care provision which were covered in some detail, did suggest that certain aspects of these broader changes were associated with changes in employment, at least for some sections of the population. Income support changes may have enabled more mothers, particularly those in low-income households, to stay at home with young children. This might be part of the reason for the slower growth in female employment in the 1990s, as payments to single-income families increased.  
&#182;
The increased availability of formal child care was likely to have enabled more mothers to work, although the use of informal care, and parental-care only also grew over the 1980s and 1990s. The cost of care continues to be prohibitive for some families.  
&#182;
Increases in part-time work continued even when the overall rate of employment slowed down. Changes in industrial relations, through award restructuring and the introduction of enterprise bargaining, were associated with an increased availability of part-time jobs. This sustained use of part-time work was congruent with the employment preferences of working mothers with young children. Also, the evidence presented shows that part-time work has grown in higher status as well as lower status jobs. 
&#182;
Overall, while it was not possible to identify the exact causes of employment change, the compositional (education and childbearing changes in particular), attitudinal and broader infrastructure/policy changes were no doubt related.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">mothers</field><field name="subject">part-time work</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">transitions</field><field name="subject">child care</field><field name="subject">income support</field><field name="subject">demographics</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070716.112159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Political Triage: Health and the State in Myanmar (Burma)</field><field name="creator">Rudland, Emily</field><field name="description">In 1988, the military government in Myanmar abandoned the socialist ideology and isolationism that had shaped the state since independence, embarking on a transition to an open economy and engagement of the international community. 
&#182;
Where socialism had failed, economic development and partnerships with former insurgent groups became the new strategy to advance the military&#146;s security agenda. The primary goal of the security agenda is to promote state consolidation based on a unitary state structure, and according to military values and interests. However, the military&#146;s goals are antagonistic to much of the country&#146;s population, especially its ethnic minority groups. Consequently, the military lacks moral authority, and is preoccupied with maintaining its power and seeking legitimacy. The state is oriented to regime maintenance rather than policy implementation, leaving the regime without autonomy to pursue policy goals outside of its security agenda. 
&#182;
The changing nature of the state, and state-society relations during the period of transition is revealed by trends in social development. Specifically, this thesis explores these issues through a case study of the health system. One impact of the economic transition and the military&#146;s new nation-building strategy has been the abandonment of social equity as an ideological goal of the state. Even under socialism, state capacity to promote health was weak. In the transitional state, weak state capacity is now combined with a political incapacity of the regime to make public health a priority. In the quest for performance legitimacy, the military government is pursuing a narrow conception of development that values economic growth. Putting the state&#146;s scarce resources into social development does not fit into this development strategy. Government expenditure on health has declined steadily since 1988, and health bureaucrats struggle to implement government policy. Standards in the public health system are very low, and most people seek health care in the private and informal health sectors. 
&#182;
Therefore, the military regime&#146;s inability to achieve state consolidation, which leaves it preoccupied with its own legitimacy crisis, is a significant factor in the inability of the Myanmar state to promote social development. The process of economic transition from a socialist economy has exacerbated this through the withdrawal of the state from financing and delivery of social services, resulting in increasing inequity of access to these services.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myanmar</field><field name="subject">Burma</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">state</field><field name="subject">society</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070719.123952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Classical and Quantum Field Theory of Bose-Einstein Condensates</field><field name="creator">Wuester, Sebastian</field><field name="description">We study the application of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) to simulations of phenomena across a number of disciplines in physics, using theoretical and computational methods.

Collapsing condensates as created by E. Donley et al. [Nature 415, 39 (2002)] 
exhibit potentially useful parallels to an inflationary universe. To enable the exploitation of this analogy, we check if current quantum field theories describe collapsing condensates quantitatively, by targeting the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical values for the time to collapse. To this end, we couple the lowest order quantum field correlation functions to the condensate wavefunction, and solve the resulting Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations numerically. Complementarily, we perform stochastic truncated Wigner simulations of the collapse. Both methods also allow us to study finite temperature effects.
&#182;
We find with neither method that quantum corrections lead to a faster collapse than is predicted by Gross-Pitaevskii theory. We conclude that the discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values of the collapse time cannot be explained by Gaussian quantum fluctuations or finite temperature effects. 
Further studies are thus required before the full analogue cosmology potential of collapsing condensates can be utilised.
&#182;
As the next project, we find experimental parameter regimes in which stable three-dimensional Skyrmions can exist in a condensate. We show that their stability in a harmonic trap depends critically on scattering lengths, atom numbers, trap rotation and trap anisotropy.  In particular, for the Rb87  |F=1,m_f=-1&gt;, |F=2,m_f=1&gt; hyperfine states, stability is sensitive to the scattering lengths at the 2% level. We find stable Skyrmions with slightly more than 2*10^6 atoms, which can be stabilised against drifting out of the trap by laser pinning.
&#182;
As a stepping stone towards Skyrmions, we propose a method for the stabilisation of a stack of parallel vortex rings in a Bose-Einstein condensate. The method makes use of a ``hollow'' laser beam containing an optical vortex, which realises an optical tunnel for the condensate. Using realistic experimental parameters, we demonstrate numerically that our method can stabilise up to 9 vortex rings. 
&#182;
Finally, we focus on analogue gravity, further exploiting the analogy between flowing condensates and general relativistic curved space time. We compare several realistic setups, investigating their suitability for the observation of analogue Hawking radiation. We link our proposal of stable ring flows to analogue gravity, by studying supersonic flows in the optical tunnel. We show that long-living immobile condensate solitons generated in the tunnel exhibit sonic horizons, and discuss whether these could be employed to study extreme cases in analogue gravity. 
&#182;
Beyond these, our survey indicates that for conventional analogue Hawking radiation, 
simple outflow from a condensate reservoir, in effectively one dimension, has the best properties. We show with three dimensional simulations that stable sonic horizons exist under realistic conditions.  However, we highlight that three-body losses impose limitations on the achievable analogue Hawking temperatures. These limitations vary between the atomic species and favour light atoms. 
&#182;
Our results indicate that Bose-Einstein condensates will soon be useful for interdisciplinary studies by analogy, but also show that the experiments will be challenging.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bose-Einstein condensates</field><field name="subject">Quantum-Field Theory</field><field name="subject">Analogue gravity</field><field name="subject">Skyrmions</field><field name="subject">Collapsing</field><field name="subject">Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov</field><field name="subject">Truncated Wigner</field><field name="subject">Analogue Hawking radiation</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070802.161045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colonial Modernity across the Border: Yaeyama, the Ryukyu Islands, and Colonial Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Matsuda, Hiroko</field><field name="description">Contemporary scholars of imperialism and colonialism studies have revealed how different imperial spaces were malleable, and they constantly shift through negotiations between diverse agencies.  Whereas most existing studies investigate change of imperial space from the view of &#145;metropolitan centre&#146;, this thesis attempts to decentralise the dominant view of existing Japanese imperialism studies, and explores the Japanese imperial expansion with a particular focus on people&#146;s subjectivities and agencies on the national border zone.  The thesis particularly focuses on the border/boundary between the Yaeyama Archipelago of the Ryukyu Islands and colonial Taiwan. 
The first chapter explores the boundary between Yaeyama and Taiwan in representation and discourse after Yaeyama was annexed to Japan.  I discuss how &#145;Yaeyama&#146; came to appear as a historical subject in the Japanese colonial discourse, by distinguishing itself from the colonised subject as well as criticising the dominance of the main island of Okinawa.  In critically examining the previous Yaeyama Studies, I suggest reconstructing Yaeyama&#146;s history in the East Asian regional framework.  The second chapter explores how civilians actively committed themselves to defining the national territory during the late nineteenth century.  The chapter also aims to reconsider the dominant discourse of Okinawa&#146;s modern history, which tends to focus on conflicts between the Japanese government and the former samurai class of Okinawa prefecture.
Chapters 3 further discusses how people on the border zone constructed the boundary between Japan and Taiwan, but I argue that the border between Yaeyama and Taiwan did not only demarcate the &#145;metropolitan nation&#146; and the &#145;colony&#146;, but also demarcated the &#145;rural&#146; and the &#145;urban&#146; areas.  In other words, the third chapter considers how the national border had different implications to people on the border zone. I explore how new settlers dominated the newly emerging economy of Yaeyama and developed trade links with colonial Taiwan.  Furthermore, I discuss how while Yaeyama native farmers were marginalised from the local economy and industry, they also crossed the border in a form of rural-urban migration.  
Chapters 5 and 6 examine Yaeyama migrants&#146; experiences in Taiwan.  Firstly, I explore in what social and cultural conditions Yaeyama migrants lived and worked during the 1920s to the 1940s.  I argue that the distinction between &#145;Japanese&#146; and &#145;Taiwanese&#146; was not instantly determined by the colonial authority, but continuously constructed and negotiated by social agents.  In Chapter 6, I examine how Yaeyama migrants shaped their Japanese identity by distinguishing themselves from the colonised subjects.  
The southern border between the Inner Territory and the Outer Territories were constituted through the interaction between ensembles of practices in the local &#145;place&#146; and the wider imperial networks and &#145;space&#146;. Yaeyama people&#146;s experiences of constructing and crossing the boundary effectively demonstrates how the determination of the Japanese national border was incorporated into colonialism, and how Japanese colonialism was associated with the emergence of modernity in East Asia.  With a particular focus on the border islands of Yaeyama, this thesis presents an alternative view to Japanese colonial history, East Asian social history as well as Okinawa&#146;s modern history.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Imperialism</field><field name="subject">Nationalism</field><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="subject">Minority</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Space and Place</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070906.193727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does it pay to go to school? The benefits of and participation in education of Indigenous Australians</field><field name="creator">Biddle, Nicholas Grahame</field><field name="description">Those who have finished high school and/or obtained non-school qualifications experience a range of positive outcomes throughout their lives. Despite these benefits being likely to apply to the Indigenous Australian population, current as well as past participation in education is substantially lower than that of the non-Indigenous population. Some reasons for this relatively low participation may be locational and monetary disadvantage, household overcrowding and a curriculum that is not always relevant. How Indigenous Australians form their expectations about the benefits of education and what these expectations might be (accurate or otherwise) may also influence educational participation. 

This thesis looks at the education outcomes of Indigenous Australians. There are two main research questions are examined. The first is what are the relative benefits of education for the Indigenous population? The main outcomes that are focussed on are employment and income; however, there is also analysis of the extent to which those with higher education levels report better health outcomes or more favourable health behaviour. 

The second main research question is what factors are associated with the decision to attend high school? That is, does the Indigenous population respond to the economic incentives to undertake education as estimated in this thesis? In addition, other factors at the individual, household and area level are likely to influence the social costs and benefits of education, as well as geographic and financial access. The extent to which these are associated with high school participation is also examined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Human Capital</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Australians</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20071008.152249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobility Metrics for Routing in MANETs</field><field name="creator">Xu, Sanlin</field><field name="description">A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes forming a temporary network without the need for base stations or any other pre&#150;existing network infrastructure. In a peer-to-peer fashion, mobile nodes can communicate with each other by using wireless multihop communication. Due to its low cost,
high flexibility, fast network establishment and self-reconfiguration, ad hoc networking has received much interest during the last ten years. However, without a fixed infrastructure, frequent path changes cause significant numbers of
routing packets to discover new paths, leading to increased network congestion and transmission latency over fixed networks. Many on-demand routing protocols have been developed by using various routing mobility metrics to choose the most reliable
routes, while dealing with the primary obstacle caused by node mobility.
&#182;
In the first part, we have developed an analysis framework for mobility metrics in random mobility model. Unlike previous research, where the mobility metrics were mostly studied by simulations, we derive the analytical expressions of mobility
metrics, including link persistence, link duration, link availability, link residual time, link change rate and their path equivalents. We also show relationships between the different
metrics, where they exist. Such exact expressions constitute precise mathematical relationships between network connectivity and node mobility.
&#182;
We further validate our analysis framework in Random Walk Mobility
model (RWMM). Regarding constant or random variable node velocity, we construct the transition matrix of Markov Chain Model through the analysis of the PDF of node separation after one epoch. In addition, we present intuitive and simple expressions for the link residual time and link duration, for the RWMM, which relate them directly to the ratio between transmission range and node speed. We also illustrate the relationship between link change rate and link duration. Finally, simulation results for all mentioned mobility metrics are reported which match well the proposed analytical framework.
&#182;
In the second part, we investigate the mobility metric applications on caching strategies and hierarchy routing algorithm. When on-demand routing employed, stale route cache
information and frequent new-route discovery in processes in MANETs generate considerable routing delay and overhead. This thesis proposes a practical route caching strategy to minimize routing delay and/or overhead by setting route cache timeout to a mobility metric, the expected path residual time. The strategy is independent of network traffic load and adapts to various
non-identical link duration distributions, so it is feasible to implement in a real-time route caching scheme. Calculated results
show that the routing delay achieved by the route caching scheme is only marginally more than the theoretically determined minimum. Simulation in NS-2 demonstrates that the end-to-end delay from DSR routing can be remarkably reduced by our caching scheme. By using overhead analysis model, we demonstrate that the minimum routing overhead can be achieved by increasing timeout to around twice the expected path residual time, without significant increase in routing delay.
&#182;
Apart from route cache, this thesis also addresses link cache strategy which has the potential to utilize route information more efficiently than a route cache scheme. Unlike some previous link cache schemes delete links at some fixed time after they enter the cache, we proposes using either the expected path duration or the link residual time as the link cache timeout. Simulation results in NS-2 show that both of the proposed link caching schemes can improve network performance in the DSR by reducing dropped data packets, latency and routing overhead, with the link residual time scheme out-performing the path duration scheme.
&#182;
To deal with large-scale MANETs, this thesis presents an adaptive k-hop clustering algorithm (AdpKHop), which selects clusterhead (CH) by our CH selection metrics. The proposed CH selection criteria enable that the chosen CHs are closer to the cluster centroid and more stable than other cluster members with respect to node mobility. By using merging threshold
which is based on the CH selection metric, 1-hop clusters can merge to k-hop clusters, where the size of each k-hop cluster adapts to the node mobility of the chosen CH. Moreover, we propose a routing overhead analysis model for k-hop clustering
algorithm, which is determined by a range of network parameters, such as link change rate (related to node mobility), node degree and cluster density. Through the overhead analysis, we show that an optimal k-hop cluster density does exist, which is
independent of node mobility. Therefore, the corresponding optimal
cluster merging threshold can be employed to efficiently organise k-hop clusters to achieve minimum routing overhead, which is highly desirable in large-scale networks.
&#182;
The work presented in this thesis provides a sound basis for future research on mobility analysis for mobile ad hoc networks, in aspects such as mobility metrics, caching strategies and k-hop clustering routing protocols.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MANETs</field><field name="subject">mobile ad hoc networks</field><field name="subject">mobility metrics</field><field name="subject">Markov chain model</field><field name="subject">route caching</field><field name="subject">link caching</field><field name="subject">cache timeout</field><field name="subject">minimum routing overhead</field><field name="subject">hierarchy routing</field><field name="subject">k-hop clustering</field><field name="subject">clusterhead selectionmetric</field><field name="subject">optimal cluster density</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070621.212401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Reading Lines in Shifting Sands: making organisational culture relevant</field><field name="creator">Britton, Garth Murray</field><field name="description">Despite the ubiquity of the term &#145;organisational culture&#146; in both popular and scholarly management literature, it remains an ambiguous concept, whose practical application is recognised as being far from universally successful. Models which seem to be preferred by practitioners are often criticised as being static or mechanistic, while more dynamic scholarly approaches tend to discount the possibility of deliberately influencing organisations at the cultural level. This dissertation, instead of focussing on culture as some sort of objective or unchanging attribute of an organisation, treats it as a phenomenon emerging from social interaction and individual sense-making. It draws on, and extends, George Kelly&#146;s Personal Construct Psychology to build a framework for understanding the production of meaning by individuals in their social context, and how this contributes to the establishment of the collective boundaries between which cultural effects are observed. This framework is applied to the case of a business school attached to a large university, which is first absorbed into its Commerce Faculty, and then dissolved into a new Department, as the overall university structure is modified. Grounded Theory methodology is used to develop an approach to the description of the cultural interaction and changes that occur, and to generate theory that goes some way to explaining how and why they do. The theory gives insight into how latent cultural distinctions become, or are made, salient and the different means by which divisions may be resolved or superseded, sometimes resulting in conflict. Implications are explored for the management of organisations undergoing change, particularly where this involves merging or restructuring organisational units, and for the training and development of managers who are to be involved in such activities.
&#182;
At a theoretical level, building on a constructivist and processual ontological base, the dissertation makes contributions to the understanding of behaviour in organisations and draws on pragmatic epistemologies such as those advanced by George Herbert Mead. It brings concepts from psychology, sociology and management disciplines to bear on the problem of cultural interaction, and suggests that integrating them in this way may enhance their value in this context.
&#182;
By focussing on culture as a phenomenon produced at the interface of collective constructions, the dissertation proposes that it be viewed as fundamentally dynamic once eloquently described as &#145;multiple cross-cutting contexts&#146; &#150; but, nevertheless, explains how it may be recognised more through its apparent intractability than its fluidity. Whilst rejecting managerialist approaches which would suggest that culture and, through it, people, can be manipulated at will to reliably produce desired effects, the dissertation suggests ways in which insight into cultural interactions might be generated for those who are participating in them, and options developed to influence these interactions that might otherwise not have been available. It therefore has potentially valuable implications for management practice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organizational culture</field><field name="subject">corporate culture</field><field name="subject">culture change</field><field name="subject">change management</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural management</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20071105.161653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Space-Time Coding and Space-Time Channel Modelling for Wireless Communications</field><field name="creator">Lamahewa, Tharaka Anuradha</field><field name="description">In this thesis we investigate the effects of the physical
constraints such as antenna aperture size, antenna geometry and
non-isotropic scattering distribution parameters (angle of
arrival/departure and angular spread) on the performance of coherent
and non-coherent space-time coded wireless communication systems.
First, we derive analytical expressions for the exact pairwise error
probability (PEP) and PEP upper-bound of coherent and non-coherent
space-time coded systems operating over spatially correlated fading
channels using a moment-generating function-based approach. These
analytical expressions account for antenna spacing, antenna
geometries and scattering distribution models. Using these new PEP
expressions, the degree of the effect of antenna spacing, antenna
geometry and angular spread is quantified on the diversity advantage
(robustness) given by a space-time code. It is shown that the number
of antennas that can be employed in a fixed antenna aperture without
diminishing the diversity advantage of a space-time code is
determined by the size of the antenna aperture, antenna geometry and
the richness of the scattering environment.
&#182;

In realistic channel environments the performance of space-time
coded multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems is significantly
reduced due to non-ideal antenna placement and non-isotropic
scattering. In this thesis, by exploiting the spatial dimension of a
MIMO channel we introduce the novel use of linear spatial precoding
(or power-loading) based on fixed and known parameters of MIMO
channels to ameliorate the effects of non-ideal antenna placement on
the performance of coherent and non-coherent space-time codes. The
spatial precoder virtually arranges the antennas into an optimal
configuration so that the spatial correlation between all antenna
elements is minimum. With this design, the precoder is fixed for
fixed antenna placement and the transmitter does not require any
feedback of channel state information (partial or full) from the
receiver. We also derive precoding schemes to exploit non-isotropic
scattering distribution parameters of the scattering channel to
improve the performance of space-time codes applied on MIMO systems
in non-isotropic scattering environments. However, these schemes
require the receiver to estimate the non-isotropic parameters and
feed them back to the transmitter.
&#182;

The idea of precoding based on fixed parameters of MIMO channels is
extended to maximize the capacity of spatially constrained dense
antenna arrays. It is shown that the theoretical maximum capacity
available from a fixed region of space can be achieved by power
loading based on previously unutilized channel state information
contained in the antenna locations. We analyzed the correlation
between different modal orders generated at the transmitter region
due to spatially constrained antenna arrays in non-isotropic
scattering environments, and showed that adjacent modes contribute
to higher correlation at the transmitter region. Based on this
result, a power loading scheme is proposed which reduces the effects
of correlation between adjacent modes at the transmitter region by
nulling power onto adjacent transmit modes.
&#182;

Furthermore, in this thesis a general space-time channel model for
down-link transmission in a mobile multiple antenna communication
system is developed.  The model incorporates deterministic
quantities such as physical antenna positions and the motion of the
mobile unit (velocity and the direction), and random quantities to
capture random scattering environment modeled using a bi-angular
power distribution and, in the simplest case, the covariance between
transmit and receive angles which captures statistical
interdependency.  The Kronecker model is shown to be a special case
when the power distribution is separable and is shown to
overestimate MIMO system performance whenever there is more than one
scattering cluster. Expressions for space-time cross correlations
and space-frequency cross spectra are given for a number of
scattering distributions using Gaussian and Morgenstern's family of
multivariate distributions. These new expressions extend the
classical Jake's and Clarke's correlation models to general
non-isotropic scattering environments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">space-time coding</field><field name="subject">space-time channel modelling</field><field name="subject">MIMO</field><field name="subject">channel capacity</field><field name="subject">spatial precoding</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070816.152647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Burmese Buddhist Imagery of the Early Bagan Period (1044-1113)</field><field name="creator">Galloway, Charlotte Kendrick</field><field name="description">Buddhism is an integral part of Burmese culture. While Buddhism has been practiced in Burma for around 1500 years and evidence of the religion is found throughout the country, nothing surpasses the concentration of Buddhist monuments found at Bagan. Bagan represents not only the beginnings of a unified Burmese country, but also symbolises Burmese 'ownership' of Theravada Buddhism. 
&#182;
While there is an abundance of artistic material throughout Burma, the study of Burmese Buddhist art by western scholars remains in it infancy due to historical events. In recent years, opportunities for further research have increased, and Bagan, as the region of Buddhism's principal flowering in Burma, is the starting point for the study of Burmese Buddhist art. To date, there has been no systematic review of the stylistic or iconographic characteristics of the Buddhist images of this period. This thesis proposes, for the first time, a chronological framework for sculptural depictions of the Buddha, and identifies the characteristics of Buddha images for each identified phase. The framework and features identified should provide a valuable resource for the dating of future discoveries of Buddhist sculpture at Bagan. 
&#182;
As epigraphic material from this period is very scant, the reconstruction of Bagan's history has relied heavily to this point in time on non-contemporaneous accounts from Burma, and foreign chronicles. The usefulness of Bagan's visual material in broadening our understanding of the early Bagan period has been largely overlooked. This is addressed by relating the identified stylistic trends with purported historical events and it is demonstrated that, in the absence of other contemporaneous material, visual imagery is a valid and valuable resource for both supporting and refuting historical events. 
&#182;
Buddhist imagery of Bagan widely regarded to represent the beginnings of 'pure' Theravada practice that King Anawrahta, the first Burman ruler, actively encouraged. This simplistic view has limited the potential of the imagery to provide a greater understanding of Buddhist practice at Bagan, and subsequently, the cross-cultural interactions that may have been occurring. In this light the narrative sculptural imagery of the period is interrogated against the principal Mahayana and Theravada texts relating to the life of Gotama Buddha. This review, along with the discussion regarding potential agencies for stylistic change, reveals that during the early Bagan period, Buddhism was an eclectic mix of both Theravada and Mahayana, which integrated with pre-existing spiritual traditions. Towards the end of the early Bagan period, trends were emerging which would lead to a distinctly Burmese form of Buddhist practice and visual expression.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Burma</field><field name="subject">Buddhist sculpture</field><field name="subject">Bagan</field><field name="subject">Buddhist art</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20071112.160557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heavy-Ion-Irradiation-Induced Disorder in Indium Phosphide and Selected Compounds</field><field name="creator">Khalil, Ali Saied</field><field name="description">Indium phosphide (InP) is an important III-V compound, with a variety of applications, for example, in light emitting diodes (LED), InP based photonic crystals and in semiconductor lasers, heterojunction bipolar transistors in integrated circuit applications and in transistors for microwave and millimeter-wave systems. The optical and electrical properties of this compound can be further tailored by ion implantation or prospectively by swift heavy ion beams. 
&#182;
Thus knowledge of ion-induced disorder in this material is of important fundamental and practical interest. However, the disorder produced during heavy ion irradiation and the subsequent damage accumulation and recovery in InP is far from being completely understood. In terms of the damage accumulation mechanisms, the conclusions drawn in the numerous studies performed have often been in conflict with one another. A factor contributing to the uncertainties associated with these conflicting results is a lack of information and direct observation of the &#147;building blocks&#148; leading to the ultimate damage created at high ion fluences as an amorphous layer. These building blocks formed at lower fluence regimes by single ion impacts can be directly observed as isolated disordered zones and ion tracks for low energy and swift heavy ion irradiation, respectively. 
&#182;
The primary aim of this work has thus been to obtain a better understanding of the disorder in this material through direct observations and investigation of disorder produced by individual heavy ions in both energy regimes (i.e. elastic and inelastic energy deposition regimes) especially with low ion fluence irradiations. In this thesis the heavy ion induced disorder introduced by low energy Au ions (100 keV Au+) and high energy Au (200 MeV Au+16) ion irradiation in InP were investigated using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS/C) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). 
&#182;
The accumulation of damage due to disordered zones and ion tracks is described and discussed for both low energy and swift ion irradiation respectively. 
&#182;
The in-situ TEM annealing of disordered zones created by 100 keV Au+ ion irradiation shows that these zones are sensitive to electron beam irradiation and anneal under electron energies not sufficient to elastically displace lattice atoms, i.e. subthreshold energies for both constituent atoms In and P. 
&#182;
Ion tracks due to swift heavy ion irradiation were observed in this material and the interesting track morphology was described and discussed. The surface nanotopographical changes due to increasing fluence of swift heavy ions were observed by AFM where the onset of large increase in surface roughness for fluences sufficient to cause complete surface amorphization was observed.  
&#182;
In addition to InP, the principle material of this project, a limited amount of TEM observation work has been performed on several other important compounds (apatite and monazite) irradiated by 200 MeV Au+ ions for comparative purposes. Again the observed segmental morphology of ion tracks were shown and possible track formation scenario and structure were discussed and similarities were drawn to the previously observed C60 cluster ion tracks in CaF2 as more knowledge and data base exist about defect dynamics and formation in that material.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disordered Zones</field><field name="subject">Ion Tracks</field><field name="subject">Swift Heavy Ions</field><field name="subject">Transmission Electron Microscopy</field><field name="subject">Atomic Force Microscopy</field><field name="subject">Electron-Beam-Induced Annealing</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20070716.140841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meeting Urban Water Needs:  Exploring Water Governance and Development in Tagbilaran City, the Philippines</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Karen Toni</field><field name="description">Water is subject to uncertainty of supply (quantity) and quality, which affects decisions determining allocation, use and management for human and environmental functions.  Tensions concerning water and its allocation reflect conflicting ideologies influencing development.  Focusing on water governance enables the allocation and management of environmental resources and tensions in development to be explored.
&#182;
This research has as its central argument the notion that water governance is conceptualised differently at different scales and as discourses become localised, hybrid forms emerge.  Place-specific hybrid governance systems which are cognisant of transformations in the local political economy and environmental characteristics can be useful in managing risks and uncertainty about water supply.  This is particularly so where local knowledge about formal institutions regulating water governance and environmental conditions is low.  This is because hybrid systems are more likely to be responsive to local needs than national or supra-national discourse allows.  However, there are limitations with hybrid systems, particularly in terms of allocating responsibility and risk, which require effective coordination.
&#182;
The aim of this research is to uncover local perspectives and knowledge about water governance and hybridity in urban environments which can be used to shape and influence urban water management.  I explore the hybridisation of water governance by considering the problem of ensuring urban water supply in a developing country context.  The research was undertaken as an inductive, qualitative inquiry comprising a case study in Tagbilaran City, Bohol, the Philippines.  Tagbilaran is a small sized city with a population of approximately 87,000 people.  The city is experiencing relatively rapid population growth along with urban development and expansion in which water demand already outstrips water supply.  Ethnographic, interpretive techniques were used to distil local perspectives about water governance which are juxtaposed with official policy and discourse.  Research methods included participant observation, semi-structured interviews with government employees, government officials and key informants from other organisations.  Other methods included structured household surveys and the use of documentary sources.
&#182;
This research reveals how formal approaches to urban water governance systems have been shaped by international development thinking and discourse.  Current strategies to manage water emphasise an integrated approach which encompasses environmental, social and economic domains.  At the same time neoliberal discourse exerts a powerful influence over how urban water is conceptualised and managed, and who should be responsible for its provision.  The case study allows for the exploration of the ways in which development and water governance discourse have been articulated and the consideration of the local factors which have enabled the emergence of hybrid water supply services embedded in a localised hybrid governance system.
&#182;
I show how water governance in Tagbilaran is hybrid because of the global-local dialectic that informs policy and practice, public-private engagement in water provision, and inter-jurisdictional water sharing.  I also demonstrate how households&#146; experiences of water supply and their physical environment influence decisions about household allocation and perceptions about human-environment interactions and water security.  As a consequence, knowledge about water governance held at the household level emerges as localised and specific in which everyday experience shapes ideas around responsibility and agency such that local forms of government and engagement have more meaning for households than national and supra-national discourse.  The juxtaposition of formal, bureaucratic governance institutions with household knowledge exposes multiple understandings of water governance and water supply in Tagbilaran.
&#182;
The findings of this research reveal that household conceptions of water governance are divorced from formal conceptions of water governance.  There is a risk, therefore, that an over-emphasis on network expansion without due consideration of water resource management may lead to greater levels of consumption.  This will continue to place pressure on resources and may ultimately lead to water insecurity.  This is because local knowledge of the formal political, economic, and administrative institutions is limited at the household level.  Therefore, this research argues that local perspectives and knowledge need to be incorporated more into management and policy decision making.  Alternatively, greater effort needs to be made to communicate formal policy to the household level.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban water</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">environmental knowledge</field><field name="subject">hybrid governance</field><field name="subject">urbanisation</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20061221.100356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long-Range Dependence of Markov Processes</field><field name="creator">Carpio, Kristine Joy Espiritu</field><field name="description">Long-range dependence in discrete and continuous time Markov
chains over a countable state space is defined via embedded
renewal processes brought about by visits to a fixed state. In the
discrete time chain, solidarity properties are obtained and
long-range dependence of functionals are examined.  On the other
hand, the study of LRD of continuous time chains is defined via
the number of visits in a given time interval. Long-range
dependence of Markov chains over a non-countable state space is
also carried out through positive Harris chains. Embedded renewal
processes in these chains exist via visits to sets of states
called proper atoms.

Examples of these chains are presented, with particular attention
given to long-range dependent Markov chains in single-server
queues, namely, the waiting times of GI/G/1 queues and queue
lengths at departure epochs in M/G/1 queues.  The presence of
long-range dependence in these processes is dependent on the
moment index of the lifetime distribution of the service times.
The Hurst indexes are obtained under certain conditions on the
distribution function of the service times and the structure of
the correlations. These processes of waiting times and queue sizes
are also examined in a range of M/P/2 queues via simulation (here, P denotes a Pareto distribution).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">long-range dependence</field><field name="subject">Markov chains</field><field name="subject">Harris chains</field><field name="subject">queues</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20061024.131933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the offshore petroleum negotiations between Australia, the U.N. and East Timor</field><field name="creator">Munton, Alexander J.</field><field name="description">In this thesis I investigate the process of international negotiation to resolve a serious dispute between Australia and East Timor over offshore oil and gas, which arose after East Timor&#146;s transition to independence in 1999.

White Australia was central to the making of the Australian working class, to the shaping of Australian nationalism, and the development of federal political institutions. It has long been understood as a product of labour movement mobilising, but this thesis rejects that approach, arguing that the labour movement lacked the power to impose such a fundamental national policy, and that the key decisions which led to White Australia were demonstrably not products of labour movement action.
&#182;
It finds three great ruling class agendas behind the decisions to exclude Chinese immigrants, and severely limit the use of indentured &#147;coloured labour&#148;. Chinese people were seen as a strategic threat to Anglo-Australian control of the continent, and this fear was sharpened in the mid-1880s when China was seen as a rising military power, and a necessary ally for Britain in its global rivalry with Russia. The second ruling class agenda was the building of a modern industrial economy, which might be threatened by industries resting on indentured labour in the north. The third agenda was the desire to construct an homogenous people, which was seen as necessary for containing social discontent and allowing &#147;free institutions&#148;, such as parliamentary democracy.
&#182;
These agendas, and the ruling class interests behind them, challenged other major ruling class interests and ideologies. The result was a series of dilemmas and conflicts within the ruling class, and the resolution of these moved the colonial governments towards the White Australia policy of 1901. The thesis therefore describes the conflict over the use of Pacific Islanders by pastoralists in Queensland, the campaign for indentured Indian labour by sugar planters and the radical strategy of submerging this into a campaign for North Queensland separation, and the strike and anti-Chinese campaign in opposition to the use of Chinese workers by the Australasian Steam Navigation Company in 1878. The first White Australia policy of 1888 was the outcome of three separate struggles by the majority of the Anglo-Australian ruling class&#151;to narrowly restrict the use of indentured labour in Queensland, to assert the right of the colonies to decide their collective immigration policies independently of Britain, and to force South Australia to accept the end of Chinese immigration into its Northern Territory. The dominant elements in the ruling class had already agreed that any serious move towards federation was to be conditional on the building of a white, predominantly British, population across the whole continent, and in 1888 they imposed that policy on their own societies and the British government.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White Australia Policy</field><field name="subject">racism</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Marxism</field><field name="subject">colonial</field><field name="subject">settler state</field><field name="subject">Parkes</field><field name="subject">Griffith</field><field name="subject">McIlwraith</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">slavery</field><field name="subject">unfree labour</field><field name="subject">Pacific Islanders</field><field name="subject">Kanakas</field><field name="subject">coolies</field><field name="subject">indentured labour</field><field name="subject">conservative</field><field name="subject">liberal</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">imperialism</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080101.181655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Empirical insights into the black box of decision-making in new ventures : a study based on biotechnology companies in Australia and India</field><field name="creator">Sardana, Deepak</field><field name="description">Abstract not supplied</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">entrepreneurial decision-making</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">new business ventures</field><field name="subject">business management</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080115.153853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural resilience and prosperity : the relevance of government and community networks</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Kathryn Janet (Lamb)</field><field name="description">Dominant &#145;society centred&#146; interpretations of social capital in Australia are
inadequate to explain the economic fortunes and social prosperity of rural
Australian communities. Given the continued contention over interpretations and
measurement of social capital, this research sought to assess the relationship
between different interpretations of social capital and rural communities&#146; resilience
and prosperity.
&#182;
Utilising both quantitative and qualitative techniques to establish the relative
levels of social capital in two communities of divergent growth, the primary
objective was to test the association asserted between levels of social capital and
prosperity and resilience in the rural Australian context.
&#182;
The research findings highlight three notable issues. Surveying social capital with
current instruments is only effective in establishing the well being of rural
communities which appears related to their resilience, not their ability to prosper.
Secondly, the operational frameworks and responsibilities for social capital
adopted by governments dictate the manner in, and degree to which they deem
bridging and linking networks necessary and appropriate. This significantly affects
the role social capital is perceived to play in communities. Lastly, while
interpretations of social capital regard it as a normative factor in social life, rather
than being comprised of different and dynamic elements affecting communities&#146;
ability to prosper, the concept will remain unable to effectively contribute to the
policy domain.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">rural communities</field><field name="subject">community prosperity</field><field name="subject">community resilience</field><field name="subject">linking networks</field><field name="subject">government policy</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080115.173131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artificial biomineralisation
and metallic soaps</field><field name="creator">Corkery, Robert</field><field name="description">In this thesis, geometry is used as a basis for conducting experiments aimed at growing
and arranging inorganic minerals on curved interfaces. Mineralisation is directed using
crystalline and liquid-crystalline metallic soaps and surfactant/water systems as
templates.&#182;
A review of the history, syntheses, structure and liquid crystallinity of metallic soaps
and other amphiphiles is presented as a foundation to understanding the interfacial
architectures in mesostructured template systems in general.&#182;
In this study, a range of metallic soaps of varying chain length and cation type are
synthesised and characterised to find potentially useful templates for mineral growth.
These include alkaline-earth, transition metal, heavy metal and lanthanide soaps. These
are systematically characterised using a variety of analytical techniques, including
chemical analyses, x-ray diffraction (XRD) infrared spectroscopy (IR) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC). Their molecular and crystal structures are studied using
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryo-TEM, electron diffraction (ED), electron
paramagnetic spin resonance (EPR), absorption spectroscopy (UV-VIS), high resolution
laser spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron dispersive x-ray analysis
(EDXA), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and magnetic measurements. Models for
the molecular and crystal structures of metallic soaps are proposed. The soaps are
predominantly lamellar crystalline or liquid crystalline lamellar rotor phases with tilted
and/or untilted molecular constituents. These display evidence of varying degrees of
headgroup organisation, including superstructuring and polymerisation. A single crystal
structure is presented for a complex of pyridine with cobalt soap. Simple models for
their structure are discussed in terms of their swelling properties in water and oils.
Experiments are also presented to demonstrate the sorbent properties of aluminium
soaps on oil spills.&#182;
The thermotropic liquid crystallinity of alkaline earth, transition metal, heavy metal and
lanthanide soaps is investigated in detail. This is done to assess their suitability as
templates, and to document their novel thermotropic behaviour, particularly the
relatively unknown lanthanide soaps. Liquid crystalline behaviours are studied using
high-temperature XRD (HTXRD), hot-stage optical microscopy and DSC. Models for a
liquid crystalline phase progression from crystals to anisotropic liquids are discussed in
terms of theories of self-assembly and interfacial curvature. The terminology required
for this is drawn from various nomenclature systems for amphiphilic crystals and liquid
crystals. General agreement with previous studies is reported for known soaps, while
liquid crystallinity is demonstrated in the lanthanide and some non-lanthanide soaps for
the first time. A general phase progression of crystalline lamellar through liquid
crystalline lamellar to non-lamellar liquid crystalline is discussed in terms of models
concerned with the molecular and crystal structures of the soaps and their phase
transitions via headgroup and chain re-arrangements.&#182;
Experiments aimed at guiding growth of metal sulfides using metallic soaps as
templates are described, and a model for this growth is discussed. Metal sulfides have
been successfully grown by reacting crystalline and liquid crystalline transition metal
and heavy metal soaps with H2S gas at room temperature and at elevated temperature.
These have been characterised using XRD, TEM, ED and IR. Sulfide growth is
demonstrated to be restricted and guided by the reacting soap template architecture.
Zinc, cadmium, indium and lead soaps formed confined nanoparticles within the matrix
of their reacting soap template. In contrast, curved and flat sheet-like structures, some
resembling sponges were found in the products of sulfided iron, cobalt, nickel, copper,
tin and bismuth soaps. A model to explain this behaviour is developed in terms of the
crystal and liquid crystal structures of the soaps and the crystal structures of the metal
sulfide particles.&#182;
Liquid crystalline iron soaps have been subjected to controlled thermal degradation
yielding magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Some XRD and TEM evidence has been
found for formation of magnetic mesostructures in heat-treated iron soaps. Models for
the molecular and liquid crystalline structure of iron soaps, their thermotropic phase
progression and eventual conversion to these magnetic products are discussed.
Systematic syntheses of mesoporous silicates from sheeted clays are discussed.&#182;The
templates that have been used are cationic surfactants and small, organic molecular
salts. Experiments are reported where a cooperative self-assembly of
surfactant/water/kanemite plus or minus salt and oils yields 'folded sheet materials'
(FSM'S). Templating of kanemite has also been achieved using cobalt cage surfactants.
A theoretical prediction of the specific surface areas and specific volumes of
homologous sets of FSM's gave excellent agreement with measured values. The
geometry and topology of the mesostructures are discussed. A theoretical model is also
discussed regarding the curvature found in the sheets of natural clays , and results of
templating clays and silica using metallic soaps are presented. Experiments and a model for low temperature nucleation and growth of microporous silicalite-1 are described in
terms of silica templating by water clathrates.&#182;
Finally, the problem of finding minimal surface descriptions of crystal networks is
addressed. Combinatoric methods are used to disprove the existence of possible
embeddings of type I and II clathrate networks in non-self intersecting periodic minimal
surfaces. The crystal network of the clathrate silicate, melanophlogite is successfully
embedded in the WI-10 self-intersecting surface. Details of a previously unreported,
genus-25 periodic surface with symmetry Im3m are discussed.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomineral</field><field name="subject">metal soap</field><field name="subject">metallic soap</field><field name="subject">curvature</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="subject">self-assembly</field><field name="subject">lipid</field><field name="subject">lanthanide</field><field name="subject">fatty acid</field><field name="subject">liquid crystal</field><field name="subject">mesophase</field><field name="subject">nanoparticle</field><field name="subject">quantum dot</field><field name="subject">metal sulfide</field><field name="subject">transmission electron microscopy</field><field name="subject">x-ray diffraction</field><field name="subject">differential scanning calorimetry</field><field name="subject">metal oxide</field><field name="subject">kanemite</field><field name="subject">mesoporous</field><field name="subject">FSM-16</field><field name="subject">clay</field><field name="subject">talc</field><field name="subject">minimal surface</field><field name="subject">cubic</field><field name="subject">lamellar</field><field name="subject">hexagonal</field><field name="subject">hyperbolic</field><field name="subject">saddle</field><field name="subject">template</field><field name="subject">interface</field><field name="subject">silica</field><field name="subject">surfactant</field><field name="subject">Langmuir-Blodgett</field><field name="subject">zeolite</field><field name="subject">silicalite</field><field name="subject">zsm-5</field><field name="subject">amphiphile</field><field name="subject">differential geometry</field><field name="subject">topology</field><field name="subject">mesostructured</field><field name="subject">nanostructured</field><field name="subject">nanoporous</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080124.190014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in the Geographic Dispersion of Urban Employment in Australia</field><field name="creator">Hunter, Boyd Hamilton</field><field name="description">This thesis is an empirical investigation of the concentration of employment in Australian cities since 1976.  In 1976, Australians shared the same access to employment irrespective of where they lived.  However, by 1991 the employment&#150;population ratios varied systematically by socio-economic status.  The purpose of this thesis is to use a variety of basic statistical techniques to discern whether it matters where one lives.&#182;  
A panel of 9384 small urban areas is constructed from the last four censuses to enable us to fully document the increasing spatial employment inequality in urban areas and to analyse the possible causes and effects of this increase.  The first two chapters describe the overall changes in employment inequality in the urban panel using several summary indexes.  Group averages from deciles ranked by socio-economic status are used to illustrate the nature of the problem.&#182; 
The more formal analysis of the causes of increasing inequality commences with a shift share analysis of the changes in employment levels.  The results show that national changes in industry structure play an important role in determining the intra-urban distribution of employment.  The index of sectoral change also varies systematically within Australian cities, with sectoral change being concentrated in low status areas.  The apparent importance of industry structure in determining the geographic dispersion of employment points to employment demand being a significant part of the story.&#182;  
Basic regression techniques and principal component analysis are also used to shed light on several possible inter-related causes and effects of the increasing inequality of employment&#150;population ratios including: increased concentrations of personal characteristics, spatial mismatch, neighbourhood effects and the development of an underclass.&#182; 
There are three main findings about the causes and effects of neighbourhood employment inequality.  Firstly, spatial mismatch within or between Australian cities is not an important explanation of the changes in the geographic dispersion of employment.  Outside Sydney the location of workers vis-&#224;-vis firms does not influence neighbourhood employment&#150;population ratios.  However, even in Sydney, spatial mismatch provides a very limited explanation of neighbourhood inequality.&#182;  
Secondly, substantial neighbourhood-specific effects on employment&#150;population ratios are apparent in the bottom decile(s) of urban neighbourhoods ranked by socio-economic status.  These neighbourhood effects explain between one and two-thirds of the differential between the top and bottom decile.  The rest of the differential can be explained by differences in endowments of personal characteristics such as human capital variables.&#182;  
Finally, there is convincing evidence that class, and perhaps even an Australian underclass, are important determinants of the distribution of employment outcomes.  The underclass in Australia, as measured using techniques similar to US studies, is still very small but is increasing at an alarming rate.  However, the sensitivity analysis shows that the underclass, so measured, is closely related to a more general concept of class captured in standard socio-economic status indexes.&#182;  
The scope of this thesis is limited by the regional aggregates supplied in all four censuses.  Regional aggregates prevent us from asking subtle questions about who is being affected by the observed changes.  The lack of adequate individual-level migration data for neighbourhoods means that it is not possible to directly test any hypothesis about social mobility.  This thesis is merely a preliminary analysis of whether the local social environment is important.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban inequality</field><field name="subject">spatial mismatch</field><field name="subject">underclass</field><field name="subject">neighbourhood effects</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080215.102127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representing the complexity, diversity and particularity of the doctoral enterprise in Australia</field><field name="creator">Cumming, Jim</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the need to reconceptualise the doctoral experience at a time when the boundaries between education, training, research, work and career development are becoming increasingly blurred. It does so by means of a detailed analysis of what candidates do and how they operate in a variety of disciplinary, employment and other contexts.&#182;
In order to synthesise and interpret the outcomes of that analysis a broader concept of the doctoral enterprise is developed within which the lived experience is embedded. It is argued that effective representation of the doctoral enterprise is as important as its reconceptualisation, and that both processes are required to generate in-depth understanding of the complexity, diversity and particularity of this phenomenon.&#182;
Case narratives incorporating the perspectives of candidates&#151;as well as those whom they deem to be influencing their research and learning&#151;are employed to portray distinctive elements of doctoral work and its associated outcomes. Quantitative data and analysis derived from a national survey of doctoral candidates are combined subsequently with this qualitative material in order to generate further insight regarding doctoral activities and the entities that are integral to their enactment.&#182;
Drawing on theories of practice, an integrative model of the doctoral enterprise is then presented. This comprises two basic components, one of which is a set of doctoral practices classified in terms of curriculum, pedagogy, research and work. The other is a set of doctoral arrangements that reflect configurations of entities inclusive of the participants, the academy and the community.&#182;
The purpose of the model is to increase understanding of the dynamic and evolving nature of the doctoral enterprise and the interrelationships involving practices and arrangements. This model has implications for candidates and others involved directly in the doctoral enterprise, regardless of their sector, role or status.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">doctoral research</field><field name="subject">theses</field><field name="subject">doctoral candidates</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="subject">university education</field><field name="subject">university research</field><field name="subject">career development</field><field name="subject">academic disciplines</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080304.115824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data Editing and Logic: The covering set method from the perspective of logic</field><field name="creator">Boskovitz, Agnes</field><field name="description">Errors in collections of data can cause significant problems when those data are used.  Therefore the owners of data find themselves spending much time on data cleaning.  This thesis is a theoretical work about one part of the broad subject of data cleaning - to be called the covering set method.   More specifically, the covering set method deals with data records that have been assessed by the use of edits, which are rules that the data records are supposed to obey. The problem solved by the covering set method is the error localisation problem, which is the problem of determining the erroneous fields within data records that fail the edits. In this thesis I analyse the covering set method from the perspective of propositional logic. I demonstrate that the covering set method has strong parallels with well-known parts of propositional logic.  The first aspect of the covering set method that I analyse is the edit generation function, which is the main function used in the covering set method.  I demonstrate that the edit generation function can be formalised as a logical deduction function in propositional logic.  I also demonstrate that the best-known edit generation function, written here as FH (standing for Fellegi-Holt), is essentially the same as propositional resolution deduction.  Since there are many automated implementations of propositional resolution, the equivalence of FH with propositional resolution gives some hope that the covering set method might be implementable with automated logic tools.  However, before any implementation, the other main aspect of the covering set method must also be formalised in terms of logic.  This other aspect, to be called covering set correctibility, is the property that must be obeyed by the edit generation function if the covering set method is to successfully solve the error localisation problem.  In this thesis I demonstrate that covering set correctibility is a strengthening of the well-known logical properties of soundness and refutation completeness.  What is more, the proofs of the covering set correctibility of FH and of the soundness / completeness of resolution deduction have strong parallels: while the proof of soundness / completeness depends on the reduction property for counter-examples, the proof of covering set correctibility depends on the related lifting property.  In this thesis I also use the lifting property to prove the covering set correctibility of the function defined by the Field Code Forest Algorithm. In so doing, I prove that the Field Code Forest Algorithm, whose correctness has been questioned, is indeed correct. The results about edit generation functions and covering set correctibility apply to both categorical edits (edits about discrete data) and arithmetic edits (edits expressible as linear inequalities). Thus this thesis gives the beginnings of a theoretical logical framework for error localisation, which might give new insights to the problem.  In addition, the new insights will help develop new tools using automated logic tools.  What is more, the strong parallels between the covering set method and aspects of logic are of aesthetic appeal.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data editing</field><field name="subject">data cleaning</field><field name="subject">propositional logic</field><field name="subject">propositional resolution</field><field name="subject">Fellegi-Holt</field><field name="subject">Field Code Forest Algorithm</field><field name="subject">error localisation</field><field name="subject">reduction property for counter-examples</field><field name="subject">lifting property</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080314.163155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable development or resource cursed? An exploration of Timor-Leste's institutional choices.</field><field name="creator">Drysdale, Jennifer</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the institutional choices available to Timor-Leste to manage their natural resource wealth wisely and avoid the resource curse. Timor-Leste is a poor country and its challenge is to use its large per capita resource wealth to alleviate poverty and enable  sustainable development. This research examines the Petroleum Fund Law, and other mechanisms to manage petroleum revenue that the Government of Timor-Leste has established. These mechanisms appear to be resilient, but remain untested. Based on field interviews in Timor-Leste, the study offers insights into the opinions of East Timorese and foreign advisers about how Timor-Leste&#180;s petroleum revenue should be managed, and how a poor country can  raise the living standards of its people.&#182;A framework that identifies human and social capital as essential to the quality of institutions is developed in this research, which proposes that the pre-condition of institutions affects the management of natural resource revenue. As a result of history (not its natural resource wealth) Timor-Leste&#180;s productive institutions are weak and destructive institutions, such as corruption, are strong. The preferences of the research participants, identified using semi-structured interviews and multi-criteria decision analysis, revealed that what petroleum revenue is spent on is the most important petroleum revenue management decision. Further, health and education were regarded the highest spending priorities. Petroleum revenue management decisions that may affect Timor-Leste&#180;s economic, social and political independence were also important to participants.&#182;Timor-Leste&#180;s sustainable development depends on continued assistance in the form of foreign advisers to address its lack of human capital. A commitment to transparency should counteract the lack of trust between government and civil society. Timor-Leste will also need to invest more in people, and recognise that the wise management of its petroleum revenue depends as much on good governance as the mechanisms designed to manage it. The people of Timor-Leste&#180;s fierce determination to overcome the challenges they face, against all odds, may help Timor-Leste to avoid the resource curse.&#182;</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Timor-Leste</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">Petroleum revenue management</field><field name="subject">poor country</field><field name="subject">East Timorese people</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">resource curse</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080408.145700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Atmospheric pressure Radio Frequency discharges, diagnostic and numerical modeling</field><field name="creator">Balcon, Nicolas</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to investigate the properties of a Radio Frequency capacitive discharge at atmospheric pressure in argon. In these conditions where the pressure x distance product is around 150 Torr.cm, the discharge usually consists of several locally hot filaments. By pulsing the RF generator with an appropriate width and period, it was found possible to control the filament to glow transition in order to obtain a diffused and stable plasma.&#182;
The 2 mm gap between the electrodes is open to the ambient air and fed with argon via one hundred submillimetric holes regularly spread on the surface of the top electrode. This configuration allows &#147;on-line&#148; surface treatment of polymer films without having to turn the discharge off between successive samples. An important and lasting improvement of the polymer wettability is quickly obtained without risk of damage.
The plasma diagnostic methods are emission spectroscopy and electric measurements. The Stark broadening of the Balmer &#946; transition line of atomic hydrogen is measured to determine a plasma density of 10^15/cm3 in the filamentary mode. The glow mode density estimation was based on power balance yielding a density of 5&#215;10^11/cm3. Emission line ratios between neutrals and Ar+ ions are used in the Saha equation to calculate the electron temperature. It results in an approximation of 1.3 eV for the glow mode and 1.7 eV for the filaments.&#182;
A unidimensional self-consistent fluid model is developed to gain insight into the homogeneous discharge behaviour. Poisson&#146;s equation for the electric field is coupled to the first moments of the Boltzmann equation (continuity equation, drift-diffusion equation and energy equation). Transport and reaction coefficients are obtained from the mean energy of the electrons.&#182;
The model is applied to a reduced argon kinetic with the main ionization and excitation processes. Simulation results are in agreement with experimental measurements. The atmospheric pressure RF discharge is similar to a lower pressure RF discharge for which the ionization occurs mainly inside the oscillating sheaths where electrons are the most energetic</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radio frequency discharges &#150; atmospheric pressure plasma &#150; dielectric barrier discharges &#150; fluid model &#150; polymer surface treatment &#150; optical diagnostic &#150; Stark broadening &#150; partial local Saha equilibrium</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080318.234936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pushing the boundaries of condensed matter electron momentum spectroscopy</field><field name="creator">Bowles, Cameron Michael Albert</field><field name="description">An electron momentum spectrometer at the Australian National University has been used to study various aspects of different solid state systems.

This thesis is divided into seven chapters, the first chapter is an introduction into the field of electron momentum spectroscopy, highlighting what has been measured before and how the technique has progressed to its present state. Some comparisons to other experimental techniques will be made.&#182;

The second chapter describes the ANU EMS spectrometer in detail. The technique requires some technical and advanced equipment that is often used in novel ways. The production of thin (20 nm) free standing targets will be detailed, along with the experimental chamber and electronics used to run the apparatus and collect data. The determination of the energy and momentum resolution of the experiment is also described.&#182;

The third chapter will detail the design and construction of the new spin polarised electron source. The results of commissioning and characterizing the new source will be presented.&#182;

Chapters four through six will present the measured results. The fourth chapter will detail the single crystalline measurements for the group eleven noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au). Each sample was measured along three high symmetry directions and compared to a DFT calculation using the LDA and a FP-LMTO basis. The fifth chapter will include the results from samples that were in disordered states, a measurement which is unique to the EMS technique. The polycrystalline and amorphous states of the Si and Ge semiconductors are presented and conclusions are made to the degree of difference in the results and to which theoretical approach to the unique amorphous state of the semiconductors best matches the EMS results. The sixth chapter includes results of ferromagnetic iron, measured using the spin polarised electron source. The spectrometer was used to measure spin-polarised electron-energy-loss-spectroscopy (SPEELS) and magnetic electron-Compton profiles. A theoretical investigation is also presented in chapter six which details the advancements required in the spin polarised electron gun to measure an accurate spin-polarised EMS spectra of a ferromagnetic Fe sample.&#182;

Chapter 7 includes the summary of all the results presented and conclusions reached from the comparison of the measured EMS spectra and various theoretical calculations. A discussion is presented about the future directions and possibilities of the EMS technique.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EMS</field><field name="subject">(e</field><field name="subject">2e)</field><field name="subject">semiconductors</field><field name="subject">spin polarised</field><field name="subject">spectral function</field><field name="subject">electron spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Cu</field><field name="subject">Ag</field><field name="subject">Au</field><field name="subject">Si</field><field name="subject">Compton profiles</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080409.193948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer Modelling and Simulations of Enzymes and their Mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Alonso, Hernan</field><field name="description">Although the tremendous catalytic power of enzymes is widely recognized, their exact mechanisms of action are still a source of debate. In order to elucidate the origin of their power, it is necessary to look at individual residues and atoms, and establish their contribution to ligand binding, activation, and reaction. Given the present limitations of experimental techniques, only computational tools allow for such detailed analysis. During my PhD studies I have applied a variety of computational methods, reviewed in Chapter 2, to the study of two enzymes: DfrB dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and methyltetrahydrofolate: corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein methyltransferase (MeTr).
&#182;
The DfrB enzyme has intrigued microbiologists since it was discovered thirty years ago, because of its simple structure, enzymatic inefficiency, and its insensitivity to trimethoprim. This bacterial enzyme shows neither structural nor sequence similarity with its chromosomal counterpart, despite both catalysing the reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) using NADPH as a cofactor. As numerous attempts to obtain experimental structures of an enzyme ternary complex have been unsuccessful, I combined docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations to produce a reliable model of the reactive DfrB&#149;DHF&#149;NADPH complex. These results, combined with published empirical data, showed that multiple binding modes of the ligands are possible within DfrB.
&#182;
Comprehensive sequence and structural analysis provided further insight into the DfrB family. The presence of the dfrB genes within integrons and their level of sequence conservation suggest that they are old structures that had been diverging well before the introduction of trimethoprim. Each monomer of the tetrameric active enzyme presents an SH3-fold domain; this is a eukaryotic auxiliary domain never found before as the sole domain of a protein, let alone as the catalytic one. Overall, DfrB DHFR seems to be a poorly adapted catalyst, a &#145;minimalistic&#146; enzyme that promotes the reaction by facilitating the approach of the ligands rather than by using specific catalytic residues.
&#182;
MeTr initiates the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of anaerobic CO2 fixation. It catalyses the transfer of the N5-methyl group from N5-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3THF) to the cobalt centre of a corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein. For the reaction to occur, the N5 position of CH3THF is expected to be activated by protonation. As experimental studies have led to conflicting suggestions, computational approaches were used to address the activation mechanism.
&#182;
Initially, I tested the accuracy of quantum mechanical (QM) methods to predict protonation positions and pKas of pterin, folate, and their analogues. Then, different protonation states of CH3THF and active-site aspartic residues were analysed. Fragment QM calculations suggested that the pKa of N5 in CH3THF is likely to increase upon protein binding. Further, ONIOM calculations which accounted for the complete protein structure indicated that active-site aspartic residues are likely to be protonated before the ligand. Finally, solvation and binding free energies of several protonated forms of CH3THF were compared using the thermodynamic integration approach. Taken together, these preliminary results suggest that further work with particular emphasis on the protonation state of active-site aspartic residues is needed in order to elucidate the protonation and activation mechanism of CH3THF within MeTr.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computational biology</field><field name="subject">molecular dynamics</field><field name="subject">docking</field><field name="subject">free energy</field><field name="subject">protonation</field><field name="subject">drug resistance</field><field name="subject">protein flexibility</field><field name="subject">ligand binding</field><field name="subject">dihydrofolate reductase</field><field name="subject">methyl transferase</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20061212.161155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The World Wide Web and Environmental Communication: A study into current practices in the Australian Minerals Industry</field><field name="creator">Lodhia, Sumit</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the factors that influence the extent to which the World Wide Web
(henceforth web) is utilised by corporations in an environmentally sensitive industry to
communicate with their stakeholders in relation to environmental issues. The study
initially establishes, in theory, the communication potential of the web and possible
factors which can impact on the extent to which this potential is utilised for
environmental communication. Subsequently, it examines the use of the web by specific
companies in the Australian minerals industry for communicating environmental issues
to their stakeholders over time. Explanations for current practices are established
through an analysis of the impact of the factors established in theory on web based
environmental communication in the Australian minerals industry.&#182;
A model was established to guide the research process for this study. Drawing upon
media richness theory (Daft &amp; Lengel, 1984, 1986; Sproull, 1991; Valacich et al.,
1993), the Media Richness Framework was developed to provide criteria for assessing
the communication potential of the web. It was also posited that the extent to which this
potential is utilised in practice is dependent on management&#146;s web based
communication needs. These needs incorporate timeliness, accessibility, presentation
and organisation, and interaction. Contextual factors, which include limitations of web
based technologies, economic, internal organisational and external stakeholder issues,
influence these needs.&#182;
Case study research (Hagg &amp; Hedlund, 1979; Yin, 2003a, 2003b; Scapens, 2004) was
used as the methodological approach for this thesis in order to obtain an in-depth
understanding of current web based environmental communication practices. An
evaluation of the websites of mining companies was used as the basis for selecting three
companies as cases. These cases involved a triangulation of approaches towards data
collection: monitoring corporate websites on a regular basis; interviewing appropriate
personnel in these organisations; and evaluating documents related to the companies&#146;
environmental communication practice. Data gathered from interviews, websites and
documents were analysed for individual cases and then through cross-case comparisons.
The intention was to confirm the research model and to potentially extend it through a
consideration of other factors not identified in theory but evident in current practices.&#182;

The findings of this research indicate that even though the web has the potential to
enhance environmental communication in an environmentally sensitive industry that is
subject to extensive stakeholder pressures, there is variation in its use by companies in
the Australian minerals industry. An evaluation of the practices of the three chosen
companies highlighted that while the web is used extensively by these companies in
comparison with other corporations in the industry, the case study companies were at
different stages of web based environmental communication.&#182;
Management&#146;s web based environmental communication needs and the influence of
contextual factors on these needs explained the variation in web based environmental
communication across all three companies. Moreover, two other factors emerged from
the field; these are referred to as the double-edged sword and change in management
philosophy. These findings from the field highlight that the need for communication
through the web could have unintended consequences while a change in management
could alter the current approach towards web based environmental communication.&#182;
This study into the use of the web in the Australian minerals industry highlights that the
medium has an impact on environmental communication practice. Further research
could assess the communication potential of the various media used for environmental
communication in order to extend the explanatory power of the current study. This
study also outlines arguments in support of extending theorisation in environmental
communication. Existing theories for social and environmental accounting, such as
stakeholder and legitimacy theory (Roberts, 1992; Lindblom, 1993; Deegan, 2002) need
to be accompanied by other theoretical perspectives in order to capture a range of
potential factors that could impact environmental communication practices. Such
insights could provide a comprehensive understanding of environmental communication
in different contexts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental communication</field><field name="subject">Environmental Reporting</field><field name="subject">Web based Environmental Communication</field><field name="subject">Communication Medium</field><field name="subject">Stakeholder Engagement</field><field name="subject">Media Richness Theory</field><field name="subject">Legitimacy Theory</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">and Australian Minerals Industry.</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080506.164718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability Bound? A study of interdisciplinarity and values in universities.</field><field name="creator">Sherren, Katherine Dove (Kate)</field><field name="description">The United Nations declared 2005 to 2014 to be the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development. This agenda is being implemented enthusiastically in university facilities management and operations, and while research in sustainability is increasingly common, tertiary curriculum has not experienced a similar push. This thesis undertakes to explore the expressions of sustainability in the academic activities of universities, and to determine what sort of change (if any) is appropriate. It also seeks to mediate what has become a polarised debate between idealists and pragmatists around the implementation of EFS. Two key features of the work are: 1) the investigation of sustainability in the aggregate student experience, rather than individual subjects; and 2) returning to first principles to avoid a normative stance a priori.&#182;
A range of methods is employed adaptively through the process of this alternately broad and deep exploratory study, including: participant observation, interviews, content analysis, questionnaires, social network analysis, bibliometrics, and data clustering. A systemic approach to Canadian and Australian case work captures the diversity of institutional roles and academic motivations at play in adaptation to the EFS agenda.&#182;
A stasis exists between the literature around higher education curriculum for sustainability and its implementation. The problem is exacerbated by the lack of pedagogical training in most university academics. A long-standing utilitarian sectoral culture and an increasingly job-focused student market further challenge such public-good concepts as sustainability in the academy. Four simple ideas sit at the heart of 35 years of environmental and sustainability education literature, despite changes in jargon: liberal education and broad foundations; interdisciplinarity in problem-solving; cosmopolitan philosophies; and civic action. Relevant disciplinary content includes biology, environmental science, policy, philosophy, human society, economics, and culture. Most of these elements are rare in the Australian sector, which instead offers science and technology-focused environmental programs with flexible requirements. A transition to the human realm is evident in programs targeting sustainability.&#182;
Curriculum cannot be viewed in isolation, however, as it concerns only one of a university&#146;s many constituencies, and one facet of academic staff scholarship. For example, even in higher education sectors more sympathetic to a diversity of university niches and curricular models, like Canada&#146;s, sustainability offerings operate at a tension from low-cost and low-effort teaching models. So-called &#145;umbrella&#146; networking structures on cross-cutting topics must walk a careful line to be comprehensive yet non-competitive. They present great opportunities for sustainability teaching but are almost uniformly research-focused. A distinct sense emerges that the erosion of the collective identity and activities of academe has weakened the ability of universities to respond to new information and challenges in anything but corporate, isomorphic ways.&#182;
Two detailed Australian cases of research, research training and curriculum development activities around sustainability paint a rich picture of the agenda. The intractability of fragmentation between disciplines is evident, even in so-called interdisciplinary units. Problem-based topics often do not have an established social network or committee structure, and priorities can differ by budget unit. Disciplines provide identity, peers and cohesive research directions that can be compelling for individual academics. The most fascinating pattern that arises during the mapping of research co-authorship and co-supervisory relationships around sustainability is the bi-directional orientation: academics collaborate outside their departmental home on papers, but within that home to mentor research students. This combination unifies two contrasting theories of social capital transmission &#150; those preferring dense and sparse networks, respectively &#150; and may be ideal. Students then receive consistent messages while gaining access to the largest (non-redundant) set of human and technical resources via their supervisors&#146; personal networks. This hypothesis should be explored further: if supported, it would have major impacts on the rhetoric around collaboration in interdisciplinary units in particular.&#182;
Curriculum design processes in utilitarian universities are subject to the same fallibilities in adapting to sustainability as other institutions and the wider society. Change is motivated and moderated by financial imperatives and the scale of thought is often coincident with budgets. Engagement processes are often incomplete or undemocratic, hampered by inadequate leadership and shifting membership. Group learning via research, experimentation or vigorous debate is surprisingly rare. Finally, ad-hoc or project-based academic teams are rarely mandated to tackle the causes of problems, some of which can be intractable, and are limited to treating the symptoms. Incremental pragmatism may be a necessary element to university adaptation for EFS.&#182;
A number of recommendations are offered to improve interdisciplinarity and university values more generally. Individual academics should: offer additive alternatives to metrics and incentive schemes that maintain existing functions; act on common ground to rebuild a community of scholars; wield to the fullest the freedom in the classroom, and the opportunity to reflect, that university teaching allows; and, continue to debate ideas with passion and rigour, avoiding &#145;academic correctness&#146;. University management can contribute by: establishing a clear academic identity for the university beyond &#145;excellence&#146;, and supporting firm foundations for students based on that particular vision; taking a proactive view of course review and development and facilitating experimentation in those settings; intentionally fostering interdisciplinary units differently to disciplinary ones; and, establishing and recognising equivalence across a range of successful academic career archetypes.&#182;
This methodologically innovative work also suggests opportunities for extending the research, including: refining and testing the sustainability canon developed here; better understanding collaborative behaviour and the impact of various models of supervisory teams on student career paths; and, finding better ways of defining, modelling and evaluating interdisciplinary scholarship. Sustainability is likeliest to emerge from a healthy and independent tertiary sector, than one operating as an overt policy instrument.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">adaptation</field><field name="subject">education for sustainability</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">liberal education</field><field name="subject">cosmopolitanism</field><field name="subject">civics</field><field name="subject">interdisciplinarity</field><field name="subject">social network analysis</field><field name="subject">bibliometrics</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">collegiality</field><field name="subject">audit</field><field name="subject">questionnaire</field><field name="subject">interview</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Canada</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080507.100919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Green Pythons</field><field name="creator">Wilson, David John Dowling</field><field name="description">The green python Morelia viridis is a most striking animal. Individuals are born either brick red or bright yellow and both colours change to green as adults. These colours and the remarkable colour change have long made them of interest to biologists
and in demand for the pet trade. Despite this interest nothing is known of their distribution, biology or ecology in the wild. Here I address this knowledge gap by presenting results from the first detailed study of the species, at Iron Range on eastern Cape York Peninsula, Australia.&#182;

Individual growth was described by the von Bertalanffy growth curve, with a
maximum predicted size of 1.35 metres snout-vent length. Males matured at 2.4 years and females at 3.6 years, and growth was indeterminate after approximately 12 years. The colour change from yellow to green occurs at 55 centimetres, which corresponds to
individuals approximately a year old. There was no sexual dimorphism in adults,
however juvenile females had larger heads than juvenile males. Adult sized individuals
comprised ~50% of the population.&#182; Females had a home range of 6.2 &#177; 1.9 ha (mean &#177; SE), which was positively correlated with their snout-vent length. Males adopted a roaming strategy through suitable habitat while juveniles were restricted to areas where more light reached the ground. There was overlap between multiple female home ranges, and between female home ranges and the movement paths of males. There were no differences in the distances moved by males and females of any size, although the variation in movement distances was greater in the dry season than the wet season.&#182;

Green pythons are obligate ambush predators which eat a variety of prey. They show an ontogenetic shift from invertebrates and terrestrial, diurnal reptiles to birds and terrestrial, nocturnal mammals. This diet change is concurrent with a shift in the time of hunting, and the location and characteristics of ambush sites. Yellow individuals were
usually found within ten metres of the ground, while green individuals used the full vegetation strata and were often found in the canopy.&#182;

The three colour morphs of the green python appear to be adaptive for
camouflage rather than intraspecific communication, as conspicuousness of each morph was always greater to a predator than to that of a conspecific. Using advanced light analysis techniques I show that each colour morph is adaptive for camouflage from visually orientated avian predators under different environmental conditions. Yellow and red morphs are half as conspicuous as green individuals would be in locations near the ground where juveniles hunt during the day. Green was the least conspicuous
morph in only the canopy, where it was half as conspicuous as either the red or yellow morph. In both leafy and non-leafy sub-canopy environments green individuals were more conspicuous than both yellow and red morphs. Red morphs were least conspicuous in only the non-leafy sub-canopy environment. The conspicuousness of green males decreased with age, but this was not the case with green females. Predation of plasticine models of the three colour morphs showed that red models were ten times more likely to be predated than either green or yellow morphs, however the model colours did not always match the real morph colours.&#182;

There is a large predicted global distribution in Papua New Guinea, including some offshore islands, however the Australian range is restricted to small areas of eastern Cape York Peninsula. In Australia green pythons occurred in nine regional ecosystems, with most records for the closed semi-deciduous mesophyll vine forest ecosystem. A mark-recapture study at Iron Range captured 101 individuals 147 times over two wet seasons, which equates to a population size of 227 &#177; 81 individuals in the study area of 51 hectares. Based on the known population structure at this site only 114
(or 50%) of these individuals are adult. Although green pythons have a high density at the one intensely studied site and are predicted to occur over a large geographic area, my data are insufficient to conclude that the species is not vulnerable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morelia viridis</field><field name="subject">snake</field><field name="subject">ontogenetic colour change</field><field name="subject">tropics</field><field name="subject">rainforest</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080527.111542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Studies of Magnetic Islands, Configurations and Plasma Confinement in the H-1NF Heliac</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Santhosh Tekke Athayil</field><field name="description">Rational   magnetic   flux  surfaces   in  fusion  (toroidal   plasma confinement) devices can break  the magnetic field lines and reconnect
them  in the  form of  magnetic islands. Formation of  these magnetic islands can have a serious impact on the plasma confinement properties of  the device.  Islands can  in  general degrade  the confinement  by
mixing up  different regions  of the plasma.   However there  has been experimental  evidence of  confinement improvement  by  island induced transport barriers, under certain  conditions. Even though there are a
large number of theoretical and experimental works on magnetic islands to  date,  there  is  clearly  a paucity  of  convincing  experimental
understanding on  the nature of  behaviour of islands in  plasma. This thesis  reports detailed  experimental  studies conducted  on the  H-1NF heliac  stellarator, to  gain  an in-depth  understanding of  magnetic islands and their influence in plasma confinement.&#182;

Work reported in  this thesis can be mainly  divided into three parts: (a)  high  resolution imaging  of  vacuum  magnetic  islands and  flux surfaces  of  H-1NF, (b)  accurate  computer  modeling  of H-1NF  magnetic
geometry and  (c) detailed experiments  on magnetic islands  in plasma configurations.&#182;

Electron-beam wire-tomography  in the H-1NF  has been used for  the high resolution   mapping   of    vacuum   magnetic   flux  surfaces   and islands.  Point-to-point  comparison   of  the  mapping  results  with
computer tracing, in conjunction  with an image warping technique, has enabled  systematic exploration  of magnetic  islands and  surfaces of interest.   A  fast  mapping   technique  has  been  developed,  which
significantly  reduced  the  mapping  time  and  made  this  technique suitable for mapping at higher magnetic fields.&#182;

Flux  surface  mapping  has  been  carried  out  at  various  magnetic configurations  and field  strengths.   The extreme  accuracy of  this technique has been exploited to understand the nature of error fields,
by  point-by-point matching  with computer  tracing results.  This has helped  in developing  a best-fit  computer model  for  H-1NF magnetic configurations,  which  can predict  rotational  transform correct  to
three  decimal places.  Results  from plasma  experiments on  magnetic configuration studies are best explained by the new model.&#182;

Experiments with  low order magnetic islands  in plasma configurations yielded  some new results.  It has  been observed  that the  low order magnetic islands  (m = 2) near  the core of the  plasma serve as pockets   of   improved    confinement   region   under   favourable conditions.   This  results   in  significant   profile  modifications including enhancement of the radial  electric field near the core to a large positive value.  The characteristics of islands are  found to be
dependent on the plasma collisionality and the island width.&#182;

Experiments  with a  magnetic configuration  which exhibits  no vacuum islands, but the core  rotational transform very close to
low order rational value, show  a spontaneous transition of the radial electric field near  the core to a large positive  value (nearly 5
kV/m), with  a strong electric  field shear (nearly 700  kV/m2) and localised improvement  in confinement, during  the discharge. Evidence indicates that the transition is driven by the excitation of low order magnetic islands  near the axis during  the plasma discharge, due to the  modification of rotational transform profile by toroidal  plasma  currents.  The  situation  is similar  to  the  Core Electron-Root Confinement (CERC)  observed during high temperature ECH
plasma discharges  on other helical devices.  This  result provides an experimental evidence for the hypothesis that the threshold conditions for observing  CERC can be  reduced by exciting magnetic  islands near
the core of the plasma.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Magnetic Islands</field><field name="subject">Wire Tomography</field><field name="subject">Radial Electric Field</field><field name="subject">Core Electron-Root</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080611.171513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Both borrowers and lenders: Time banks and the aged in Japan</field><field name="creator">Miller, Elizabeth Jill</field><field name="description">The rapid ageing of Japan&#146;s population is occurring in the midst of accelerating social change, causing a rethinking about what it means to grow old. Some older Japanese are pioneering new models for ageing through their involvement in groups known as time banks. These are non-profit organisations which trade time, a universal possession, rather than conventional currency for services. Time given in volunteering is banked for future redemption as assistance for the giver, with points paid per hour. This first study of the impact of time banks on the lives of older Japanese members aims to chart how such groups can help both their senior members and society as a whole.&#182;

Time banks now exist across the globe but the world&#146;s first time bank was established in 1973 by a Japanese woman. She aspired to create a new form of currency that could give people greater control of their lives and foster warmer community links. The benefits that older time bank members derive include formation of new friendship networks to replace those lost by retirement and the chance to use old skills and learn new ones. Time banks can generate a new form of social capital that fosters traditional Japanese reciprocity and has ikigai or &#145;sense of meaning in life&#146; as one of its main pillars.&#182;

This research is based on both three-months of fieldwork in Japan and an extensive literature review in Japanese, English and Chinese. It has been by aided by accessibility to the thoughts of the founders of four major time banks through their books and also by their group web sites. My study follows on from an MPhil thesis that compared ageing in China and Japan and draws on my experience living in Japan for 10 years between 1979 and 1991 in both Kansai and Kanto.&#182;

The literature indicates that social participation is a crucial component for maintaining both psychological and physical health in the later years. While this is a qualitative study and there is yet to be a qualitative review of the effects of time banks in Japan, feedback I received from older members of the first time bank shows that time banks can foster a meaningful later life. &#182;

The 21st century has been dubbed that of the aged as greater mass longevity boosts their numbers to unprecedented levels. This thesis questions whether organizations such as time banks can make a significant difference to the quality of life that older people enjoy in this new era. The theoretical framework examines whether the social exchange that these groups nurture can enhance the social capital of their communities, creating a positive image for ageing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time banks</field><field name="subject">ageing in Japan</field><field name="subject">volunteering</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080618.143218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of Continuous Spatial Models in Multiple Antenna Signal Processing</field><field name="creator">Glenn, Dickins</field><field name="description">This thesis covers the investigation and application of continuous spatial models for multiple antenna signal processing. The use of antenna arrays for advanced sensing and communications systems has been facilitated by the rapid increase in the capabilities of digital signal processing systems. The wireless communications channel will vary across space as different signal paths from the same source combine and interfere. This creates a level of spatial diversity that can be exploited to improve the robustness and overall capacity of the wireless channel. Conventional approaches to using spatial diversity have centered on smart, adaptive antennas and spatial beam forming. Recently, the more general theory of multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) systems has been developed to utilise the independent spatial communication modes offered in a scattering environment.&#182;
Underlying any multiple antenna system is the basic physics of electromagnetic wave propagation. Whilst a MIMO system may present a set of discrete inputs and outputs, each antenna element must interact with the underlying continuous spatial field. Since an electromagnetic disturbance will propagate through space, the field at different positions in the space will be interrelated. In this way, each position in the field cannot assume an arbitrary independent value and the nature of wave propagation places a constraint on the allowable complexity of a wave-field over space. To take advantage of this underlying physical constraint, it is necessary to have a model that incorporates the continuous nature of the spatial wave-field. &#182;This thesis investigates continuous spatial models for the wave-field. The wave equation constraint is introduced by considering a natural basis expansion for the space of physically valid wave-fields. This approach demonstrates that a wave-field over a finite spatial region has an effective finite dimensionality. The optimal basis for representing such a field is dependent on the shape of the region of interest and the angular power distribution of the incident field. By applying the continuous spatial model to the problem of direction of arrival estimation, it is shown that the spatial region occupied by the receiver places a fundamental limit on the number and accuracy with which sources can be resolved. Continuous spatial models also provide a parsimonious representation for modelling the spatial communications channel independent of specific antenna array configurations. The continuous spatial model is also applied to consider limits to the problem of wireless source direction and range localisation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telecommunications</field><field name="subject">wireless</field><field name="subject">multiple antenna</field><field name="subject">spatial channel</field><field name="subject">wave field</field><field name="subject">spatial field</field><field name="subject">multiple input multiple output</field><field name="subject">MIMO</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080702.222814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Underwater Piano: A Resonance Theory of Cochlear Mechanics</field><field name="creator">Bell, James Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis takes a fresh approach to cochlear mechanics. Over the last
quarter of a century, we have learnt that the cochlea is active and highly tuned,
observations suggesting that something may be resonating. Rather than accepting the standard traveling wave interpretation, here I investigate whether a resonance theory of some kind can be applied to this remarkable behaviour.&#182;

A historical survey of resonance theories is first conducted, and advantages
and drawbacks examined. A corresponding look at the traveling wave theory
includes a listing of its short-comings.&#182;

A new model of the cochlea is put forward that exhibits inherently high
tuning. The surface acoustic wave (SAW) model suggests that the three rows of outer hair cells (OHCs) interact in a similar way to the interdigital transducers of an
electronic SAW device. Analytic equations are developed to describe the conjectured interactions between rows of active OHCs in which each cell is treated as a point source of expanding wavefronts. Motion of a cell launches a wave that is sensed by the stereocilia of neighbouring cells, producing positive feedback. Numerical calculations confirm that this arrangement provides sharp tuning when the feedback gain is set just below oscillation threshold.&#182;

A major requirement of the SAW model is that the waves carrying the feedback have slow speed (5-200 mm/s) and high dispersion. A wave type with the
required properties is identified - a symmetric Lloyd-Redwood wave (or squirting wave) - and the physical properties of the organ of Corti are shown to well match those required by theory.&#182;
The squirting wave mechanism may provide a second filter for a primary
traveling wave stimulus, or stand-alone tuning in a pure resonance model. In both, cyclic activity of squirting waves leads to standing waves, and this provides a physical rendering of the cochlear amplifier.
In keeping with pure resonance, this thesis proposes that OHCs react to the
fast pressure wave rather than to bending of stereocilia induced by a traveling wave. Investigation of literature on OHC ultrastructure reveals anatomical features consistent with them being pressure detectors: they possess a cuticular pore (a small compliant spot in an otherwise rigid cell body) and a spherical body within (Hensens
body) that could be compressible. I conclude that OHCs are dual detectors, sensing displacement at high intensities and pressure at low. Thus, the conventional traveling wave could operate at high levels and resonance at levels dominated by the cochlear
amplifier. &#182;

The latter picture accords with the description due to Gold (1987) that the cochlea is an &#145;underwater piano&#146; - a bank of strings that are highly tuned despite immersion in liquid.&#182;
An autocorrelation analysis of the distinctive outer hair cell geometry shows
trends that support the SAW model. In particular, it explains why maximum
distortion occurs at a ratio of the two primaries of about 1.2. This ratio also produces near-integer ratios in certain hair-cell alignments, suggesting that music may have a cochlear basis.&#182;
The thesis concludes with an evaluation and proposals to experimentally test
its validity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mechanotransduction</field><field name="subject">outer hair cell</field><field name="subject">surface acoustic wave</field><field name="subject">squirting wave</field><field name="subject">pressure wave</field><field name="subject">traveling wave</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080706.141018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspect-Oriented Thinking - An approach to bridging the disciplinary divides</field><field name="creator">Flint, Shayne</field><field name="description">Engineering is often described as the application of scientific and technical knowledge to solve problems. In this thesis, I support a more general view that engineering should be treated as a continuous process of learning and action that aims to make well understood improvements within dynamically complex environments of co-evolving social, man-made and natural systems. I argue that this can only be achieved by adopting an approach that systematically develops, manages and integrates the knowledge and expertise of many disciplines to conceive, develop, modify, operate and retire systems. A novel implementation of such an approach, called Aspect-Oriented Thinking, is presented.
&#182;
Aspect-Oriented Thinking begins with the development and verification of a set of domain Models. Each Domain Model represents knowledge about a separate, autonomous and possibly discipline specific concern or view within a given context. Domain models are developed by engineers, scientists, sociologists, psychologists, lawyers, philosophers, economists and others, using languages and techniques with which they are familiar. Knowledge captured in a set of Domain Models is then woven together, in accordance with a set of separately developed patterns and rules, to construct, modify, operate and retire systems, including models, hardware, software, processes and simulations. This is a continuous process which, in the first instance, involves those systems used to learn about a given context and to make decisions regarding required changes. Later, the process involves those systems used to implement and evaluate the impact of these decisions.
&#182;
The significance of Aspect-Oriented Thinking lies in its broad applicability to any situation in which the expertise and knowledge of diverse disciplines is required to understand and make improvements within complex multifaceted
environments such as those that involve sustainable development and national security.
&#182;
A proof-of-concept within the context of software engineering is provided to demonstrate the mechanics and viability of Aspect-Oriented Thinking. The results
of this demonstration are used to support an argument for future experimentation
aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of Aspect-Oriented Thinking in a more
general interdisciplinary environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">software engineering</field><field name="subject">systems engineering</field><field name="subject">model-driven engineering</field><field name="subject">multi-disciplinary</field><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">systems thinking</field><field name="subject">modeling</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080731.204756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contested Belonging: East Timorese Youth in the Diaspora</field><field name="creator">Crockford, Fiona</field><field name="description">This research explores East Timoreseness as a complex and evolving identity in which Timorese 'frontiers', both physical and psychic, have been drawn and redrawn over time and through space. It deals specifically with the sense of displacement and ambiguity that underpins the social identities of young East Timorese living in Australia during a period of intense political transformation in East Timor&#146;s recent history (1997-1999). 
&#182;
Acknowledging the diversity of experience among diasporic youth, the study focuses primarily on young &#145;nineties&#146; Timorese, that is, those who were in their teens or early twenties when they fled East Timor in the wake of the Dili Massacre in 1991. It considers the ways in which they negotiated their experiences of displacement and the immensity of a highly politicised Timorese identity, often framed by young people themselves in terms of an embodied &#145;weight&#146; and a viscerally deep, and occasionally overwhelming, sense of moral responsibility. In the diaspora, the evocation of traumatic memory has been central to the preservation of a uniquely East Timorese identity and its reconstitution in a breached world. Memory has thus been called upon to legitimate a very specific and homogenous East Timorese identity and to reconstruct it through public ritual. Yet an over-determination of such a monological discourse threatens to subsume the heterogeneous experiences and possible alterities of young Timorese and the diversity of Timorese cultural expression. This study explores the interplay between a monological discourse that articulates a cohesive public identity that implies an &#145;authentic&#146; East Timoreseness and a dialogical discourse through which more ambiguous and hybrid identities emerge. 
&#182;
I begin by tracing the strands of history, culture, myth and power that combine to produce totalising representations of East Timoreseness and youth as patriotic and self-sacrificing collectivities. I argue that the exigencies of the struggle for independence from Indonesian occupation depended upon a very specific enactment of youth within East Timor through which East Timorese youth acquired a potent and heroic role. Yet the potency of this politicised identity has always been unstable and provisional, both within and outside of East Timor. As well, such an identity is both enabling and confining for young Timorese since its performance is always infused with power structures and relations that are both socially and spatially contingent. 
&#182;
I then explore processes of identity formation and re-evaluation among young diasporic East Timorese in depth. Removed from the immediacy of struggle, the 'doing' of youth among young diasporic East Timorese inevitably shifts according to the different knowledge formations that frame and produce 'youth' and particularly 'migrant youth' in host countries. While young Timorese often feel caught between apparently contradictory practices and constructions of youth, and discourses that oppose 'Timoreseness' and 'Australianness' (as well as &#145;Timoreseness&#146; and &#145;Indonesianness&#146;), there is always room for slippage. Thus, I draw upon examples of their cultural negotiations in the world of the arts to show how young East Timorese sought to engage in meaningful forms of social action and deployed various forms of testimonial as a self-affirming and identity-validating practice. Through practices of music, poetry and theatre young East Timorese, in different ways and with varying force, deploy cultural strategies that are not necessarily inimical or unsympathetic to the concerns and political imperatives of older generation Timorese. The everyday narratives of young Timorese, however, reveal that their identities are entangled in the complex interplay of a number of divergent and interdependent structuring dispositions: the personal and the collective; the global and local; difference and continuity; freedom and constraint. The management of these tensions, as well as the uncertainties of their legal status in Australia and political upheavals within East Timor itself, required the creation of strategies of identity that drew upon both existing and new cultural referents and resources. The experiences of young diasporic East Timorese thus highlight the dialectical and contingent character of intercultural experience and social identities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">East Timorese youth</field><field name="subject">diaspora</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">belonging</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080803.140946</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and Applications of Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics</field><field name="creator">Meglicki, Zdzislaw</field><field name="description">Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is analysed as the weighted residual method.  In particular the analysis focuses on the collocation aspect of the method.  Using Monte Carlo experiments we demonstrate that SPH is highly sensitive to  node disorder, especially in its symmetrised energy and momentum conserving form.  This aspect of the method is related to low [Beta] MHD instabilities observed by other authors.  A remedy in the form of the Weighted Differences Method is suggested, which addresses this problem to some extent, but at a cost of losing automatic conservation of energy and momentum.
&#182;
The Weighted Differences Method is used to simulate propagation of Alfven and magnetosonic wave fronts in [Beta] = 0 plasma, and the results are compared with data obtained with the NCSA Zeus3D code with the Method of Characteristics (MOC) module.
&#182;
SPH is then applied to two interesting astrophysical situations: accretion on to a white dwarf in a compact binary system, which results in a formation of an accretion disk, and gravitational collapse of a magnetised vortex.  Both models are 3 dimensional.
&#182;
The accretion disk which forms in the binary star model is characterised by turbulent flow: the Karman vortex street is observed behind the stream-disk interaction region.  The shock that forms at the point of stream-disk interaction is controlled by the means of particle merges, whereas Monaghan-Lattanzio artificial viscosity is used to simulate Smagorinsky closure.
&#182;
The evolution of the collapsing magnetised vortex ends up in the formation of an expanding ring in the symmetry plane of the system.  We observe the presence of spiralling inward motion towards the centre of attraction.  That final state compares favourably with the observed qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the circumnuclear disk in the Galactic Centre.  That simulation has also been verified with the NCSA Zeus3D run.
&#182;
In conclusions we contrast the result of our Monte Carlo experiments with the results delivered by our production runs.  We also compare SPH and Weighted Differences against the new generation of conservative finite differences methods, such as the Godunov method and the Piecewise Parabolic Method.  We conclude that although SPH cannot match the accuracy and performance of those methods, it appears to have some advantage in simulation of rotating flows, which are of special interest to astrophysics.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">SPH</field><field name="subject">Weighted Differences Method</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo experiments</field><field name="subject">NCSA Zeus3D code</field><field name="subject">astrophysics</field><field name="subject">accretion disk</field><field name="subject">magnetised vortex</field><field name="subject">tokamak</field><field name="subject">Maschke-Perrin solution</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080901.114053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Groundwater-River Interactions for
Assessing Water Allocation Options</field><field name="creator">Ivkovic, Karen Marie-Jeanne</field><field name="description">The interconnections between groundwater and river systems remain poorly understood in many catchments throughout the world, and yet they are fundamental to effectively
managing water resources. Groundwater extraction from aquifers that are connected to river systems will reduce river flows, and this has implications for riverine ecosystem
health, water security, aesthetic and cultural values, as well as water allocation and water management policies more generally. The decline in river flows as a consequence
of groundwater extractions has the potential to threaten river basin industries and communities reliant on water resources.
&#182;
In this thesis the connectivity between groundwater and river systems and the impact that groundwater extractions have on river flows were studied in one of Australia&#146;s most developed irrigation areas, the Namoi River catchment in New South Wales.
&#182;
Gauged river reaches in the Namoi River catchment were characterised according to three levels of information: 1) presence of hydraulic connection between aquifer-river
systems; 2) dominant direction of aquifer-river flux; and 3) the potential for groundwater extraction to impact on river flows. The methods used to characterise the river reaches included the following analyses: 1) a comparison of groundwater and river
channel base elevations using a GIS/Database; 2) stream hydrographs and the application of a baseflow separation filter; 3) flow duration curves and the percentage of
time a river flows; 4) vertical aquifer connectivity from nested piezometer sites; and 5) paired stream and groundwater hydrographs.
&#182;
The theoretical responses for gaining, losing and variably gaining-losing river reaches were conceptualised along with the processes that operate in these systems. Subsequently, a map was prepared for the Namoi River catchment river reaches
indicating aquifer-river connectivity and dominant direction of flux. Large areas of the Upper Namoi River catchment were found to have connected aquifer-river systems,
with groundwater extraction bores located in close proximity to the rivers. Accordingly, the potential for groundwater extraction to impact on river flows in these areas was
considered significant. The Lower Namoi was assessed as having mostly disconnected aquifer-river systems.
&#182;
In order to investigate the impacts of groundwater extraction on river flows in
connected aquifer-river systems, a simple integrated aquifer-river model entitled IHACRES_GW was developed for use at the catchment scale. The IHACRES_GW model includes a dynamic, spatially-lumped rainfall-runoff model, IHACRES, combined with a simple groundwater bucket model that maintains a continuous water
balance account of groundwater storage volumes for the upstream catchment area relative to the base of the stream, assumed to be the stream gauging station. The IHACRES_GW model was developed primarily: 1) to improve upon existing water
allocation models by incorporating aquifer-river interactions; 2) to quantify the impacts of groundwater extraction on river flows within unregulated, connected aquifer-river
systems; 3) to inform water policy on groundwater extraction; and 4) to be able to utilise the model in future integrated assessment of water allocations options at the catchment scale.
&#182;
The IHACRES_GW model was applied within the Cox&#146;s Creek subcatchment in order to test its validity. The model was used to simulate a range of extraction scenarios which enabled the impacts of groundwater extractions on river flows to be assessed. In
particular, the historical impacts of groundwater extraction on the timing, magnitude and frequency of baseflow events were quantified over a 15-year (1988-2003) simulation period. The IHACRES_GW model was also used to evaluate the implications of water sharing plans for the Cox&#146;s Creek subcatchment.
&#182;
A spatially-lumped modelling approach in the management of water resources has a number of limitations, including those arising from the lack of spatial considerations. However, it offers a number of advantages including facilitating a better understanding
of large-scale water management issues, assessing the impacts of water allocation and groundwater extraction on river flows at the catchment scale, and informing water sharing plans. In particular, this type of modelling approach lends itself to integrated
assessments of water allocation options in which hydrological, ecological and socioeconomic
data sets are combined, and where data is commonly aggregated to a larger scale of interest in response to the requirements of policy makers. The research findings from this thesis provide some insights into how to better manage the impacts of
groundwater extraction in connected aquifer-river systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">groundwater-river interactions</field><field name="subject">water allocation</field><field name="subject">hydrological model</field><field name="subject">baseflow</field><field name="subject">extraction impacts</field><field name="subject">top-down</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080901.134545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the flexural behaviour of Aluminium Foam Sandwich Structures</field><field name="creator">Styles, Millicent</field><field name="description">Aluminium foam has a range of properties that are desirable in many applications.  These properties include good stiffness and strength to weight ratios, impact energy absorption, sound damping, thermal insulation and non combustibility.  Many of these characteristics are particularly attractive for core materials within sandwich structures.  The combination of aluminium foam cores with thermoplastic composite skins is easily manufactured and has good potential as a multifunctional sandwich structure useful in a range of applications.  This thesis has investigated the flexural behaviour of such structures using a combination of experimental and modelling techniques.  The development of these structures towards commercial use requires a thorough understanding of the deformation and strain mechanisms of the structure, and this will, in turn, allow predictions of their structural behaviour in a variety of loading conditions.
&#182;
The experimental research involved the use of an advanced 3D optical measuring technique that produces realtime, full-field strain evolution during loading.  This experimental characterisation of strain evolution in this class of sandwich structure under flexural loading is the first of its kind in the world.  The experimental work studied the sandwich structure undergoing four-point bend testing.  Initial studies compared the behaviour of the aluminium foam structure with a more traditional polymer foam sandwich structure.  The aluminium foam structure was found to have equivalent or improved mechanical properties including more ductile deformation and an enhanced energy absorption.  An investigation was conducted on the effect of core and skin thickness on the metal structure and a range of flexural behaviours were observed.  Analysis of the strain distribution showed a complex development including localised effects from the non-uniform cellular structure of the material.  An understanding of the variation with size is important in establishing design methods for utilising these structures.  In particular, it is desirable that finite element simulations can be used to predict behaviour of these structures in a diverse range of loading conditions.  This aspect was considered in the second half of this study.  An existing constitutive model for aluminium foam, developed for use in compression energy absorption studies, was used to investigate finite element simulations of the flexural behaviour of the sandwich structure.  The FE model was able to predict the general deformation behaviour of the thinner skinned structures although the magnitude of the load-displacement response was underestimated.  It is suggested this may be related to the size effect on the input parameter characterisation.  The strain distribution corresponded well with the experimental strain measurements.  It was found a simple increase in the material model input parameters was able to more closely match the magnitude of the load-displacement response while maintaining the appropriate strain distribution.  The general deformation shape of the model with the thicker skin corresponded reasonably well with the experimental observations.  However, further work is necessary on the element failure criterion to capture the shear cracking observed.  The strain distributions of the model predicted this failure with high strain concentrations matching those of the experimental contours.  The last part of the thesis describes a parametric study on the effect of the foam material model input parameters on the flexural behaviour of the sandwich structure model.  An important conclusion of this work is that this material model for aluminium foam can, with some development, be utilized to provide a viable method for simulating aluminium foam composite sandwich structures in flexural loading situations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminium foam</field><field name="subject">Sandwich structure</field><field name="subject">Finite element modelling</field><field name="subject">flexural loading</field><field name="subject">strain distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20080813.170807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biologically Inspired Vision and Control for an Autonomous Flying Vehicle</field><field name="creator">Garratt, Matthew Adam</field><field name="description">This thesis makes a number of new contributions to control and sensing for unmanned vehicles. I begin by developing a non-linear simulation of a small unmanned helicopter and then proceed to develop new algorithms for control and sensing using the simulation. The work is field-tested in successful flight trials of biologically
inspired vision and neural network control for an unstable rotorcraft. The techniques are more robust and more easily implemented on a small flying vehicle than previously attempted methods.&#182; 
Experiments from biology suggest that the sensing of image motion or optic
flow in insects provides a means of determining the range to obstacles and terrain. This biologically inspired approach is applied to control of height in a helicopter, leading to the World&#146;s first optic flow based terrain following controller for an unmanned helicopter in forward flight. Another novel optic flow based controller is developed for the control of velocity in hover. Using the measurements of height from other sensors, optic flow is used to provide a measure of the helicopters lateral and longitudinal velocities relative to the ground plane. Feedback of these velocity measurements enables automated hover with a drift of only a few cm per second, which is sufficient to allow a helicopter to land autonomously in gusty conditions
with no absolute measurement of position.&#182;
New techniques for sensor fusion using Extended Kalman Filtering are developed to estimate attitude and velocity from noisy inertial sensors and optic flow measurements. However, such control and sensor fusion techniques can be computationally
intensive, rendering them difficult or impossible to implement on a small
unmanned vehicle due to limitations on computing resources. Since neural networks can perform these functions with minimal computing hardware, a new technique of control using neural networks is presented. First a hybrid plant model consisting of exactly known dynamics is combined with a black-box representation of the unknown dynamics. Simulated trajectories are then calculated for the plant using an optimal controller. Finally, a neural network is trained to mimic the optimal controller. Flight test results of control of the heave dynamics of a helicopter confirm
the neural network controller&#146;s ability to operate in high disturbance conditions and suggest that the neural network outperforms a PD controller. Sensor fusion and control of the lateral and longitudinal dynamics of the helicopter are also shown to
be easily achieved using computationally modest neural networks.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Helicopter</field><field name="subject">optic flow</field><field name="subject">neural network</field><field name="subject">terrain following</field><field name="subject">sensor fusion</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090116.154822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The detection of 2D image features using local energy</field><field name="creator">Robbins, Benjamin John</field><field name="description">Accurate detection and localization of two dimensional  (2D)  image features  (or  'key-points') is important for vision tasks such as structure from motion, stereo matching, and line labeling.   2D image features are ideal for these vision tasks because  2D image features are high in information and yet they occur sparsely in typical images.  Several methods for the detection of  2D image features have already been developed.  However, it is difficult to assess the performance of these methods because no one has produced an adequate definition of corners that encompasses all types of  2D luminance variations that make up  2D image features.  The fact that there does not exist a consensus on the definition of  2D image features is not surprising given the confusion surrounding the definition of  1D image features.  The general perception of 1D image features has been that they correspond to 'edges' in an image and so are points where the intensity gradient in some direction is a local maximum.  The Sobel [68], Canny [7] and Marr-Hildreth [37] operators all use this model of 1D features, either implicitly or explicitly.  However, other profiles in an image also make up valid 1D features, such as spike and roof profiles, as well as combinations of all these feature types.  Spike and roof profiles can also be found by looking for points where the rate of change of the intensity gradient is locally maximal, as Canny did in defining a 'roof-detector' in much the same way he developed his 'edge-detector'.  While this allows the detection of a wider variety of 1D features profiles, it comes no closer to the goal of unifying these different feature types to an encompassing definition of 1D features.  The introduction of the local energy model of image features by Marrone and Owens [45] in 1987 provided a unified definition of 1D image features for the first time.  They postulated that image features correspond to points in an image where there is maximal phase congruency in the frequency domain representation of the image.  That is, image features correspond to points of maximal order in the phase domain of the image signal. These points of maximal phase congruency correspond to step-edge, roof, and ramp intensity profiles, and combinations thereof.  They also correspond to the Mach bands perceived by humans in trapezoidal feature profiles.  This thesis extends the notion of phase congruency to  2D image features.  As 1D image features correspond to points of maximal 1D order in the phase domain of the image signal, this thesis contends that 2D image features correspond to maximal 2D order in this domain.  These points of maximal 2D phase congruency include all the different types of 2D image features, including grey-level corners, line terminations, blobs, and a variety of junctions.  Early attempts at  2D feature detection were simple 'corner detectors'  based on a model of a grey-level corner in much the same way that early 1D feature detectors were based on a model of step-edges.  Some recent attempts have included more complex models of 2D features, although this is basically a more complex a priori judgement of the types of luminance profiles that are to be labeled as  2D features.  This thesis develops the  2D local energy feature detector based on a new, unified definition of  2D image features that marks points of locally maximum  2D order in the phase domain representation of the image as  2D image features.  The performance of an implementation of  2D local energy is assessed, and compared to several existing methods of  2D feature detection.  This thesis also shows that in contrast to most other methods of  2D feature detection,  2D local energy is an idempotent operator.  The extension of phase congruency to  2D image features also unifies the detection of image features.  1D and 2D image features correspond to 1D and 2D order in the phase domain respresentation of the image respectively.  This definition imposes a hierarchy of image features, with  2D image features being a subset of  1D image features.  This ordering of image features has been implied ever since 1D features were used as candidate points for  2D feature detection by Kitchen [28] and others.  Local energy enables the extraction of both 1D and 2D image features in a consistent manner;  2D image features are extracted from the 1D image features using the same operations that are used to extract 1D image features from the input image.  The consistent approach to the detection of image features presented in this thesis allows the hierarchy of primitive image features to be naturally extended to higher order image features.  These higher order image features can then also be extracted from higher order image data using the same hierarchical approach.  This thesis shows how local energy can be naturally extended to the detection of 1D (surface) and higher order image features in  3D data sets.  Results are presented for the detection of 1D image features in 3D confocal microscope images, showing superior performance to the  3D extension of the Sobel operator  [74].</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer vision</field><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On evolving modular neural networks</field><field name="creator">Salama, Rameri</field><field name="description">The basis of this thesis is the presumption that while neural networks are useful structures that can be used to model complex,  highly non-linear systems,  current methods of training the neural networks are inadequate in some problem domains.  Genetic algorithms have been used to optimise both the weights and architectures of neural networks,  but these approaches do not treat the neural network in a sensible manner.  In this thesis,  I define the basis of computation within a neural network as a single neuron and its associated input connections.  Sets of these neurons,  stored in a matrix representation,  comprise the building blocks that are transferred during one or more epochs of a genetic algorithm.  I develop the concept of a Neural Building Block and two new genetic algorithms are created that utilise this concept.  The  first genetic algorithm utilises the micro neural building block  (micro-NBB);   a unit consisting of one or more neurons and their input connections.  The micro-NBB is a unit that is transmitted through the process of crossover  and hence requires the introduction of a new crossover operator.   However the micro NBB can not be stored as a reusable component  and must exist only as the product of the crossover operator.  The macro neural building block  (macro-NBB)  is utilised in the second genetic algorithm,  and encapsulates the idea that  fit neural networks contain  fit sub-networks, that need to be preserved across multiple epochs.  A macro-NBB is a micro-NBB that exists across multiple epochs.  Macro-NBBs must exist across multiple epochs,  and this necessitates the use of a genetic store,  and a new operator to introduce macro-NBBs back into the population at random intervals.  Once the theoretical presentation is completed the newly developed genetic algorithms are used to evolve weights for a variety of architectures of neural networks to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.  Comparison of the new genetic algorithm with other approaches is very favourable on two problems: a multiplexer problem  and a robot control problem.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Genetic algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The origin and early development of the intrinsic innervation in the foetal mouse lung</field><field name="creator">Tollet, Cecilia Jenny</field><field name="description">In this study, the origin and development of the intrinsic innervation in the foetal mouse lung is described and experimental evidence is provided to support the involvement of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the guidance of nerves and neuronal precursors in the developing lung. Antibodies were used to stain for neuronal precursors, neurones, nerve fibres, primordial epithelium and smooth muscle. These structures were revealed in whole mounts of foetal mouse lungs by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, and their spatial and temporal distribution was mapped from the onset of lung development and through the pseudoglandular period. The results showed that neuronal precursors, positive for neural crest cell markers, were present in the vagal tract of the foregut at embryonic day 10 (E10), the time of the evagination of the lung buds. These neural crest-derived cells (NCC) migrated into the lung at E11, along nerve processes directed from the vagus to the smooth musclecovered trachea and emerging lobar bronchi. During E11-E14, a network of nerves and ganglia became established along the dorsal trachea, and large ganglia formed a plexus at the ventral hilum. Nerve trunks issued from these ganglia, travelled along the smooth muscle-covered bronchi, providing a pathway for migrating NCC. To investigate the role of GDNF in the innervation of the lung, an in vitro model of left lung lobes was established. Lung growth and tubule branching was comparable to that in vivo, and neural tissue and smooth muscle continued to grow and thrive. A significant increase in nerve growth occurred when explants were cultured with GDNF compared to controls. Nerves extended, and NCC migrated towards GDNF-impregnated beads suggesting that GDNF may be the molecule guiding nerve fibres and NCC in the lung. The migrating NCC were negative for GDNF-family receptor &#945;1 (GFR&#945;1) during their migration into the lung while the nerves were positive. Since GDNF needs to be associated with its binding receptor, GFR&#945;1, for cellular signalling, GDNF may induce the migration of the NCC if they migrate along the GFR&#945;1-positive nerve fibres. It is concluded that neural tissue and smooth muscle become integral components of the lung shortly after the onset of lung development. The results show that the migration of neural crest-derived cells into the lung and the establishment of the innervation requires coordinated cross-talk between NCC, nerves and smooth muscle throughout development.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lungs -- Innervation</field><field name="subject">Fetal nerve tissue</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Nervous system</field><field name="subject">Confocal microscopy</field><field name="subject">Organ culture</field><field name="subject">Lung development</field><field name="subject">Foetal mouse</field><field name="subject">Neural crest cells</field><field name="subject">Neural development</field><field name="subject">Airway smooth muscle</field><field name="subject">GDNF</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Classical instrumental musicians : educating for sustainable professional practice</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Dawn Elizabeth</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This study extends understanding of the careers of classical instrumental musicians within the cultural industries, and ascertains the extent to which professional practice is reflected within current classical performance-based music education and training. Little is known about the careers of classically trained instrumental musicians in terms of the activities in which they engage and the skills and attributes used to sustain their professional practice, and there is also widespread lack of understanding about the music industry and the wider cultural industries. The extent to which education and training reflects the careers of music performance graduates has gained heightened exposure at the same time as higher education institutions have become increasingly accountable for the employability of graduates, and yet much of the available literature has only tangential relevance and there remains a shortage of literature relating to the complex area of creative practice. The research approach for the study bridges both the interpretive and normative paradigms. Using survey and interview methods, the study employs three distinct but interrelated data collections to investigate sustainable professional practice through analysis of musicians&#8217; careers, performance-based education and training, and the cultural industries. The study identifies the longitudinal characteristics of musicians&#8217; professional practice and presents in a conditional matrix the intrinsic and extrinsic influences that impact upon it. The study proposes a practitioner-focussed Arts Cultural Practice (ACP) framework that consists of four practitioner-focussed, non-hierarchical groups which were determined through analysis of the major foci characterising roles within the cultural industries. As such, the ACP framework represents a new paradigm of sustainable practice that circumvents existing barriers; submitting a non-hierarchical view of cultural practice that clearly indicates the potential for an exciting diversity of holistic practice often not considered by practitioners. The ACP curricular model posits the collaborative delivery of generic skills across artforms. This study substantiates the generic skills used by artists throughout the cultural industries, and confirms the rationale for education and training which considers the sustainability of music graduates&#8217; careers as arts cultural practitioners. Thus, individual strengths and talents should be developed according to the intrinsic and extrinsic influences which drive the passion for arts practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Musicians -- Training of -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Musicians -- Employment -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Music -- Vocational guidance -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The haemostatic defect of cardiopulmonary bypass</field><field name="creator">Linden, Matthew D.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass is a complex procedure that results in significant changes to blood coagulation, fibrinolytic biochemistry, platelet number and function, and the vasculature.

There are various surgical techniques for stress incontinence; however, minimally invasive operations are increasingly being chosen by surgeons and their patients. Of these procedures, tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) has a cure rate of approximately 90% and is now perceived as the standard technique for stress incontinence. Reported complications of TVT include arterial laceration, bladder perforation, bowel perforation, de novo urgency, dyspareunia, excessive blood loss, haematoma, nerve injuries, urethral erosion, urge incontinence, urinary tract infection, vascular injury, vaginal mesh erosion, voiding dysfunction and death. Suprapubic urethral support sling (SPARC) is a very similar minimally invasive operation and early indications suggested that the success rate for treating stress incontinence was expected to be identical or better than those obtained with the earlier TVT approach, with possibly fewer adverse perioperative events. Our trial sought to establish equivalence between TVT and SPARC in relation to short-term complications and efficacy. OBJECTIVES The primary outcome was bladder perforation. Secondary outcomes were blood loss, voiding difficulty, urgency, and cure of stress incontinence symptoms. METHOD A randomised controlled one-sided equivalence trial (RCT) was conducted in Perth, Western Australia during 2003 and 2004 by researchers in the School of Population Health, University of Western Australia (UWA) and King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEMH). Patients were recruited from the public Urology/Urogynaecology Clinic at the primary women's hospital and the consultant surgeons' private practices. ... However, acute urinary retention requiring a return to theatre to loosen the tape (TVT 0%, SPARC 6.5%; OR: [infinity], 95% CL: 2.2, [infinity]; p=0.002) and subjective short-term cure (TVT 87.1%, SPARC 76.5%; OR: 2.07, 95% CL: 1.13, 3.81; p=0.03) were statistically significantly different. CONCLUSIONS The results are consistent with clinical equivalence between TVT and SPARC in relation to the incidence of bladder perforation. No statistically significant difference was found between TVT and SPARC in blood loss, urgency or short-term objective cure of stress incontinence at the six week post-discharge visit to the surgeon. However, the tapes were more difficult to adjust correctly in SPARC procedures and a statistically significant number of patients required a return to theatre for loosening of the tape (TVT 0/147, 0% and SPARC 10/154, 6.5%, p=0.002). Compared with SPARC, TVT was statistically significantly higher for subjective short-term cure. In ii relation to vaginal mesh erosion, TVT was lower than SPARC, though not statistically significantly. Overall, voiding difficulty (loosening of the tape), urgency and vaginal mesh erosion were the most important clinical problems. This randomised controlled trial demonstrates the importance of testing new devices which appear to be similar, but which may have clinically relevant differences. A follow up study to assess the long-term efficacy of tension-free vaginal tape and suprapubic urethral support sling and associated complications is planned.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urinary stress incontinence</field><field name="subject">Clinical trials</field><field name="subject">Genitourinary organs -- Surgery -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Randomised controlled trial</field><field name="subject">Minimally invasive sling surgery</field><field name="subject">Urinary incontinence</field><field name="subject">Complications</field><field name="subject">Stress urinary incontinence</field><field name="subject">TVT and SPARC</field><field name="subject">Erosion</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0086</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on lipoprotein kinetics in obesity and the metabolic syndrome : impact of dietary weight loss and statin therapy</field><field name="creator">Ng, Wai</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Dyslipidaemia in obesity and the metabolic syndrome is typically characterized by elevated plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein (apo) B and chylomicron remnants, and low apoA-I levels. This may account for the increased risk of cardiovascularrelated diseases. Although the precise mechanisms whereby visceral obesity confers the onset of dyslipidaemia have not been fully established, it may relate chiefly to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance leads to increased hepatic secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) apoB, as well as impaired catabolism of VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and chylomicron remnants, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) apoA-I. This thesis tests the unifying hypothesis that lipoprotein metabolism, in particular apoB, chylomicron remnants and apoA-I, is abnormal in the metabolic syndrome, and that medical intervention can correct for these abnormalities. The primary objectives were to examine firstly, the kinetics of apoB and apoA-I by stable isotope technology and secondly, chylomicron remnant kinetics by using an indirect assessment of a new breath test. Six observational statements and related hypotheses were constructed and derived from the unifying hypothesis that examine the kinetics of lipoprotein metabolism, adipose tissue mass compartments and liver fat accumulation, as well as the impact of plasma adipocytokines in subjects with visceral adiposity and features of the metabolic syndrome. The first four observational statements related to cross-sectional studies of lipoprotein kinetics, adipose tissue mass distribution and liver fat accumulation as well as plasma adipocytokines in both obese and non-obese men. The latter two observational statements related to the effect of statin therapy and dietary weight loss on the improvement of lipoprotein kinetics in obesity. The findings from these studies collectively support the unifying hypothesis. The kinetics of apoB in VLDL, IDL and LDL, and apoA-I in HDL were assessed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry following either a primed-constant infusion of 13C-leucine or an intravenous bolus injection of d3-leucine. ... This is the first study to examine the effects of dietary weight loss on LDL and HDL metabolism and the relationships with adipocytokines in men with the metabolic syndrome. The data support the unifying hypothesis that medical intervention with dietary weight loss could correct the kinetic abnormalities in VLDL, LDL and HDL. The aforementioned studies showed that plasma lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities in visceral obesity are chiefly regulated by the combination of hepatic over-secretion of VLDL particles, and catabolic defects in apoB and chylomicron remnants as well as apoA-I-containing lipoprotein particles. These kinetic defects may also relate to low and high plasma adiponectin and RBP-4 levels, respectively. The data arising from the thesis are consistent with the unifying hypothesis and support the role of dietary intervention and pharmacotherapy as a recommended treatment in correcting the abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism within the metabolic syndrome.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lipoprotein kinetics</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome</field><field name="subject">Weight loss</field><field name="subject">Statin</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music video auteurs : the directors label DVDs and the music videos of Chris Cunningham, Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze</field><field name="creator">Fidler, Tristan</field><field name="description">Music video is an intriguing genre of television due to the fact that music drives the images and ideas found in numerous and varied examples of the form. Pre-recorded pieces of pop music are visually written upon in a palimpsest manner, resulting in an immediate and entertaining synchronisation of sound and vision. Ever since the popularity of MTV in the early 1980s, music video has been a persistent fixture in academic discussion, most notably in the work of writers like E. Ann Kaplan, Simon Frith and Andrew Goodwin. What has been of major interest to such cultural scholars is the fact that music video was designed as a promotional tool in their inception, supporting album sales and increasing the stardom of the featured recording artists. Authorship in music video studies has been traditionally kept to the representation of music stars, how they incorporate post-modern references and touch upon wider cultural themes (the Marilyn Monroe pastiche for the Madonna video, Material Girl (1985) for instance). What has not been greatly discussed is the contribution of music video directors, and the reason for that is the target audience for music videos are teenagers, who respond more to the presence of the singer or the band than the unknown figure of the director, a view that is also adhered to by music television channels like MTV.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cunningham, Chris</field><field name="subject">Gondry, Michel</field><field name="subject">Jonze, Spike</field><field name="subject">Advertising -- Production and direction</field><field name="subject">Documentary films</field><field name="subject">DVDs</field><field name="subject">Music videos -- Production and direction</field><field name="subject">Auteur theory</field><field name="subject">Directors label</field><field name="subject">Music videos</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical investigations of Natural Products from Australian Marine Sponge-Derived Fungi</field><field name="creator">Li, Hang</field><field name="description">This thesis described the chemical investigations of natural products from Australian marine sponge-derived fungi. Sponge samples were collected from the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia, by Queensland Museum. The thesis is divided into eight chapters and can be devided into two major parts. The first three chapters comprised the first part of the thesis: Chapter 1 outlined the research background, literature review of marine fungal secondary metabolites; Chapter 2 introduced fungal culture and storage background knowledge, and the list of isolated marine fungal strains. Chapter 3 introduced the background of the thrombin inhibition assay and assay results.

The second part (Chapter 4 to 7) of this thesis is focused on chemical isolation and structure elucidation of secondary metabolites from isolated fungal strains, mostly active strains against thrombin. An unidentified fungal strain, FS-G315858 (T)-Y, isolated from the frozen sponge sample Dysidea sp.1400 produced five peptide compounds (chapter 4, 16-20). Compound 16 is a polypeptide which features the same relative configuration with a known compound unguisine A, and compounds 17-20 are diketopiperazines.

Active fungal strains FS-G315695 (T)-Y and FDPS-61732-YB were isolated from different sponge samples. However, they were identified to be the identical fungal strain Eurotium rubrum; the chemical isolation of FS-G315695 (T)-Y from its mycelia EtOAc extract resulted in three compounds (chapter 5, 17-19). Compounds 18 and 19 were identified to be flavoglaucin and iso-dihydroauroglaucin. Compound 17 was identified to have the same relative configuration with a known compound neo-echinulin A. The chemical isolation of FDPS-61732-YB from its broth EtOAc extract resulted in several diketopiperazines (chapter 5, 27-29).

Another active fungal strain FS-G315695 (T)-WY was identified as Aspergillus ochraceous, the chemical isolation of its mycelia EtOAc extract resulted in one benzodiazepine compound (chapter 6, 18), together with two fatty acids (chapter 6, 16-17). The structure of compound 18 was elucidated and identified to have same relative configuration with the known compound circumdatin E.

Media comparison for active fungal strain FS-G315695 (T)-Y was conducted and this work resulted in producing several neo-echinulin analogues (chapter 7, 1-3). The isolation and structure elucidation of these compounds were reported in chapter 7.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural products</field><field name="subject">Australian marine sponge derived fungi</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">chemical investigation</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20081103.091038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lived experience of gay men 
caring for others with HIV/AIDS
: living, loving and dying
 in the era of HIV/AIDS</field><field name="creator">Munro, Ian</field><field name="description">This thesis explored gay male carers&#146; experience of caring for their partner, brother or friend who had HIV/AIDS. Through using phenomenological methodology (van Manen, 1990), the day-to-day caring experiences were uncovered. The data gathered were then analysed through a nursing &#145;lens&#146;, with the concept of stigma as an anchoring point. The dual stigmas of homophobia and AIDS phobia impacted on the daily lives of these men as they cared for their loved one. The research identified six themes. These were: 1) the relationship; 2) coping with HIV and AIDS; 3) the corporal impact of HIV/AIDS; 4) experiences of carers including the absence of others; 5) living daily with the virus: Demands of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); and 6) saying goodbye, but wanting to keep the memory alive. 

The caring these men undertook, for which they were frequently unprepared, was intensive and complex, but because of their commitment and love they battled on. Because of a sense of shame associated with AIDS phobia on the part of the PLWHA, the carer often had to undertake this care in isolation, without support from family, friends or home health care agencies. 

The carers struggled with not only the demands of day-to-day care, but also with non-acceptance from family, both of the nature of the relationship with their partner and of their homosexuality. Family members were forced, often with great difficulty, to acknowledge the close commitment the men had to each other. Recognition that one had a terminal disease, HIV/AIDS was also required. The fear of potential transmission was high among carers, friends and family members. Notably, there was an absence of blame on the part of the carer towards his partner for contracting HIV/AIDS.

The physical decline and marking of the body further stigmatised the PLWHA, which added to carers&#146; burdens. They endeavoured to minimise the physical decline in their partner, so he could continue to pass as healthy, and attempted to make the day-to-day living as normal as possible. The methods of combating weight loss and opportunistic infections meant frequent medical appointments, complex intensive medical procedures and help with personal care, which was undertaken at home largely without support from health care staff. Carers frequently struggled also with their partner&#146;s denial of being ill. 

One strategy all carers used was to escape with their partners from their everyday life in Melbourne and attempt metaphorically to leave the HIV/AIDS behind; this was a time when they could rekindle their life together as it was before HIV/AIDS came into their lives. Some carers chose to holiday without their partner, to give themselves a break from the day-to-day caring, while others planned and took holidays with their partner. The decline of the health in the PLWHA meant that family members had to recognise and accept both the nature of the relationship and the presence of the disease. This recognition and acceptance often came only when the partner was very ill, even at the point of dying. 

Carers and their partners discussed the potential use of euthanasia, as a means of ending the final phase of life with some dignity. One carer and his partner used euthanasia, despite its illegal status. The main concern for all carers was providing comfort and a reduction in the pain associated with HIV/AIDS for the partner.

The widespread grief associated with HIV/AIDS was evident amongst these carers. All had known other gay men who had died, some carers own partner had died, or was about to die. There was an overwhelming sense of grief, which at times was repressed as a means of coping day-to-day. All carers felt it was important and necessary to remember those lost to HIV/AIDS through the various public memorials, as they did not want their partner to be just another faceless person lost to this disease. 
 
This phenomenological study of carers&#146; experience highlights the need for health care workers to be aware of the differing strategies that gay men use to cope with HIV/AIDS. While it may seem that the carers are coping with care of their partner, the outer fa&#231;ade is not always an accurate portrayal of the true situation. Health care workers should enquire as to the assistance these carers need from health care services in order to continue to care for their loved one. Such assistance can be the simple recognition of the partner and acceptance of them as part of the PLWHA&#146;s network; this inclusion and acceptance is half the battle.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">carers</field><field name="subject">gay men</field><field name="subject">stigma</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20020913.150027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STUDENT SUPPORT: BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN STUDENTS AND THE UNIVERSITY</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Zillur</field><field name="description">Bangladesh introduced open and distance learning as a means of providing education for people in isolated and remote locations through the establishment of the Bangladesh Open University (BOU). The broad aim of the BOU is to provide flexible and needs-based education to those unable or not wishing to enter conventional educational institutions. The BOU is presently the only university in Bangladesh to provide mass education and also to provide continuing education and professional and technical education to support the existing educational system. The BOU has a mission that encompasses secondary and higher levels of education. 

BOU operates its programs through a centralised academic and administrative staff, and regional and local offices throughout Bangladesh that organise local tutorials and distribute information and materials. BOU has adult students in all parts of the country, and most of the students live in rural areas. They need support that is appropriate to their local circumstances. 

Using an interpretive approach, this research examines the support needs of students studying for the Secondary School Certificate and the Bachelor of Education, assesses the effectiveness of current support services and explores alternatives to the current system. The underlying assumption is that support needs to be appropriate to the country&#146;s culture and circumstances, and useful and feasible from the perspectives of students, staff, administrators and senior university officials. 

To investigate the appropriate support for distance education students, this research was conducted in four sample regions. Two were selected from areas of sparse population where the terrain makes transport difficult and two from areas that are more densely populated and where transport is easier. A questionnaire survey and focus groups were conducted with students, focus groups with local staff and interviews with Regional Directors within the four sample regions. Interviews were also undertaken with central University senior staff to get their perspectives on current and future policies for student support.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">distance education</field><field name="subject">student support</field><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="subject">open learning</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20030206.130122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Mercantilist Cinderella: Deakin University and the Distance Education Student in the Postmodern World</field><field name="creator">Zeegers, Margaret</field><field name="description">This is a thesis presented on the position of the distance education student at a distance education university in the present era. Traditionally, the distance education student has been a sort of Cinderella: marginalised, being constructed as some form of lesser version of the on campus one. A largely invisible part of the higher education system in Australia since 1911, the distance education student has really only come to be foregrounded in university education discourses from 1983 onwards. It was not until then that the distance education student emerged from &#145;hidden pools&#146; identified by Karmel (1975), and since then the construction of this student has undergone a number of modifications, mapped in this thesis. At the same time university education itself has undergone a series of modifications, not least of which has been its taking on mercantilist overtones as investments made by students in their own careers and professional development. The modifications, also mapped in this thesis, have progressed to the stage where the construction of the old distance education student is now one of a flexible learner in a mercantilist system of university education. The notion of distance education and the distance education student has undergone significant shifts, redefinitions and constructions, which are tracked in this thesis. My research has focussed on a number of pertinent questions, based on a study of Deakin University and its practice since its establishment. 

The thesis draws on a number of works which have been informed by those of Foucault, and I have framed my research questions accordingly. I have asked why and how Deakin University came into being as a distance education provider at tertiary level. What were the conditions of its establishment and progression in relation to the political events, economic practices and communication technology in use over time? 

To consider such questions, I needed to analyse the changes that I had seen occurring in the context of wider restructurings in university education. These had occurred in the context of government forging a closer interconnectedness between education and national economic aims and objectives at the same time as it demanded greater productivity in the face of commercial and industrial sector pushes for applied knowledge. 

Poststructuralist philosophical developments offer tools to explore not only questions of power, but the practical outcomes of questions of power, and how the complicity of individuals is established. This thesis explores ways in which such considerations helped to shape the changing constructions of the distance education student from a marginalised, disadvantaged and under-represented participant in higher education to a privileged, well catered for and advantaged learner. These same considerations are used to explore ways in which they have helped to shape university distance education courses from a perceived second-rate form of higher education to a prototype that better captures the essential elements of learning for what has been styled in a postmodern world as the Information Age. Overlaid on these considerations is a changing view of the economics of such provision of higher education.

It is anticipated that this thesis will contribute to developing new understandings of the construction of subjectivities in relation to the distance education university student specifically, and to the university student generally, in the postmodern world. The implications of this examination are not inconsiderable for students and academics in a self-styled Information Society.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">distance education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">mercantilism</field><field name="subject">flexible learning</field><field name="subject">Deakin University</field><field name="subject">Michel Foucault</field><field name="subject">restructuring</field><field name="subject">government policy</field><field name="subject">post-structuralism</field><field name="subject">post-modernism</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20030404.161615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General Practitioner and the Control of Sexually Transmissible Infections</field><field name="creator">Temple-Smith, Meredith Jane</field><field name="description">Sexually transmissible infections (STIs), one of the major preventable health problems affecting the Australian population, are often asymptomatic and, if undetected, can cause sub-fertility, infertility and chronic morbidity. In addition to these significant and costly consequences, STIs increase the risk of transmission of  HIV. Given that 80% of Australian patients attend their General Practitioner (GP) each year, GPs are well placed to have a significant impact on STI transmission by diagnosing and treating both asymptomatic and symptomatic disease. 

Good professional practice would suggest that all GPs will undertake certain actions when they are consulted by a patient who either has symptoms of an STI or who appears to be at risk of acquiring an STI. This expectation is based on the premise that all GPs share the same detailed knowledge of STI risk factors and symptoms. It assumes that they will have no difficulty in eliciting such information from the patient, that the patient will comply with STI testing and treatment and that the patient will return for follow-up, to ensure that they and their sexual partners have been adequately treated. 

Given the constraints of the real world in which general practice exists, the sensitive nature of sexual health, and the stigma associated with STIs, there are many barriers to achieving such an outcome. My own previous research has highlighted some of the difficulties experienced by GPs in the area of STI control. This study has used data from four different sources (policy and stakeholder documents, literature, key informant interviews and my own past research) to examine ideal practice and actual practice in the prevention and treatment of STIs. A number of discrepancies were identified, and from these arose a series of recommendations for ways of making STI control in general practice less complex. To ensure that the results of the study were firmly embedded in the reality of general practice, comments on the recommendations were sought from GPs employed in a variety of practice settings, including those with low STI caseloads. These comments were used to modify the recommendations to ensure they would offer a practical and effective contribution to STI control in Victoria.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sexually Transmitted Infections</field><field name="subject">GPs</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">general practioners</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20030414.151829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EXTERNAL PUBLIC PIANO EXAMINATIONS

SIGNIFICANCE</field><field name="creator">Ross, Valerie</field><field name="description">The thesis investigated the social and symbolic significance of acquiring a 'music education' through the taking of piano tuition and external public music examinations. It aimed to discover why the learning of the piano and the certification of musical attainment are so prevalent and revered among Malaysian music students. Its purpose was to unravel the socio-cultural raison d'etre of this approach to music education through the creation of a metatheoretical schema, which is premised upon the theories of symbolic interactionist, George Herbert Mead, music analyst, Heinrich Schenker and social theorist, George Ritzer.
Central to the argument in this instance is the symbolic significance associated with the act of playing the piano. The investigation attempted to determine if this 'act' conveyed a symbolic meaning that is peculiar to a specific cultural vista. It further examined the degree to which this practice represented both a validation and a sense of conformity to social norms in the continuity and stability of an expanding middle class society in Malaysia.
The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) is the largest of the five main external public music examination boards that operate in Malaysia. Since 1948, over one million candidates have enrolled for ABRSM examinations in Malaysia and a team of approximately thirty ABRSM examiners visit Malaysia for three months every year. The majority of the candidates are pianists. Given such large numbers of piano candidates, one might expect a healthy development of musical talent in the country with aspiring pianists eager to demonstrate their musical prowess. However, this does not seem to be the case. On the contrary, there appears to be a curious lacuna between the growing number of students who enrol for external public music examinations and the seemingly lack of interest in public music making and the honing of general musicianship skills. The thesis hence examined the symbolic meaning of this socio-rausicological phenomena.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music education</field><field name="subject">piano tuition</field><field name="subject">external public music</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">metatheoretical schema</field><field name="subject">social and symbolic interaction</field><field name="subject">George Herbert Mead</field><field name="subject">Heinrich Schenker</field><field name="subject">George Ritzer.</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031028.140256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SYPHILIS AND AIDS: HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL
COMPARISONS</field><field name="creator">Parsonson, Ian Malcolm</field><field name="description">Drawing on the literatures of history, sociology, epidemiology, and microbiology, this thesis compares syphillis with human immunodeficiency virus, with special reference to the social and historical factors likely to be relevant to the control or eradication of acquired imune dificiency syndrom (AIDS).

The sudden appearance of a new disease causing suffering and death in a community, engenders apprehension and fear which is often manifested as hysteria against, and vilification of, those who have the disease.  This fear is greatly increased should the disease be sexually-transmitted.

Syphilis in a venereal form, occured in Europe toward the end of the 15th Century.  Initially it was an acute, fulminating disease which rapidly spread through Europe and Asia.  Attempts to control the disease have gone through periods of either partial successes or massive failures and have ended in frustration for the authorities.

When the syndrome of acquired immune deficiency (AIDS) was first reported, it was seen in Western countries in homosexual men.  However, as non-homosexual community members and children became infected, it became apparent to authorities that a pandemic was accurring.  Within a few years, the disease was identified worldwide.  Isolation of the virus (HIV-1), and development of test for detection of carriers, plus restoration of clean blood and blood-product supplies, have reassured the community to some extent.

The history of syphilis shows that neither the epidemiological medical, nor the economic political approaches to disease control work, although there are positive aspects resulting from both.  It is social responses that will offer the most hope in the long term for the control of AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">syphilis</field><field name="subject">acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)</field><field name="subject">sexually transmitted diseases</field><field name="subject">Europe</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">15th Century</field><field name="subject">homosexual</field><field name="subject">non-homosexual</field><field name="subject">(HIV-1)</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031118.111824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DOING JUSTICE:
STORIES OF EVERYDAY LIFE IN
DISADVANTAGED SCHOOLS AND
NEIGHBOURHOODS</field><field name="creator">Thomson, Patricia Lorna</field><field name="description">I worked as a school administrator in 'disadvantaged schools' for many years. In this study I asked colleagues from sixteen schools in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide to co - theorise about changes in their neighbourhood, school populations and programs, now that their schools are no longer recognised by policy as 'disadvantaged1.
I explore the use of narrative method and arts based approaches by constructing a 'literary' research text that uses conventional sociological forms together with images, poetry and personal stories.
I use anthropological and geographical theoretical constructs to look at the changing material, economic, cultural and social landscapes and the mosaic of inequalities in the city of Adelaide. I suggest that this is not a simple binary polarisation, although large numbers of people are similarly positioned by de-industrialisation and the diminishing social wage. After examining the literature on poverty in Australia, I am eventually prepared to call this space class, understanding that this is a sociological metaphor.
Through a theorisation of each school as a 'place' within a specific neighbourhood, I look at the similarities and differences across sites. I suggest that 'disadvantaged schools' are similarly positioned as sites for the mediation of social inequalities, and that this can be readily seen in the time consuming 'housework' of discipline and welfare. I indicate how each school is differently able to 'do more with less', because of their unique neighbourhood and its narratives, knowledges, histories, teleologies and people. I show that the common coercive regimes of market devolution, new public management and the 'distributive curriculum' frame the work of teachers, students and administrators in ways that are not conducive to 'doing justice', despite the policy rhetoric of equity and community. I provide evidence that the neoliberal imaginary of context free schooling enshrined in effective schools literatures is Utopian and irrational. I argue that the capacity of the school to 'generate context' is always paradoxically dependent on 'context derived'.
I discuss the notion of 'doing justice' and the benefits of 'disadvantaged schools' having a local set of principles that guide their decisions and actions and provide evidence that the school administrator's understandings of 'doing justice' are important. I also suggest that, despite being increasingly isolated and hindered by policy directions, the majority of the sixteen schools continue to work for and with principles of justice and equity, drawing on a range of emotional and intellectual resources and deep, longstanding commitments.
I conclude by speculating on the kinds of policy and research agendas that might take account of both the commonalities and differences amongst 'disadvantaged schools', and what might be included in a comprehensive and systematic approach to 'doing justice'.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disadvanteged schools</field><field name="subject">Adelaide</field><field name="subject">anthropological theory</field><field name="subject">geographical theory</field><field name="subject">inequality</field><field name="subject">narratives</field><field name="subject">justice</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031119.101136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intersection of autonomy and social control: Negotiating teenage motherhood</field><field name="creator">Hanna, Barbara Anne</field><field name="description">Contrary to popular belief, teenage mothers are a declining proportion of birthing women; however they receive much negative public attention. Of particular public concern is the high cost of supporting teenage mothers, in terms of financial, health and welfare resources. Historically, the typical founding mother of white Australia was single, but post-war changes in the family structure incorporated the expectation that children be born into two-parent households with the male as the breadwinner. Policy changes in the seventies saw the introduction of the Sole Parents Pension which meant that many birthing teenage women could choose to keep their infants rather than have a clandestine adoption or an enforced marriage. The parenting practices of teenage mothers have been criticised for being less than optimal, and mother and child are reported as being disadvantaged cognitively, psychosocially, and educationally. One widespread nursing service which provides support for new mothers in Victoria is the Maternal and Child Health Service; however, teenage mothers appear reluctant to use such services. Why this should be so became an important question for this research, since little is known about the parenting practices of teenage mothers. This study therefore sought to explore mothering from the perspective of five sole supporting teenage mothers each of whom had a child over six months of age. The research methodology took an interpretive ethnographic approach and was guided by feminist principles. The data were collected through repeated interviewing, participant observation, informal discussions with key informants, field notes and journalling. Data analysis was aided by the use of the software, program NUD-IST. It was found that the young women in this study each chose to give birth with full realisation that their existence was dependent on the Welfare State. Unanticipated, however, were the many structural barriers which made their lives cataclysmic, but these reinforced their determination to prove themselves worthy and capable mothers. The young women negotiated motherhood through a range of social supports and through maternal practice. Unquestionably, their social dependency on the welfare system forced them into marginal citizen status. Moreover, absolute and intrinsic poverty levels were experienced, brought about by inadequate welfare payments. Formal support agencies, such as the Maternal and Child Health nurses were rarely approached to provide childrearing support beyond the initial months following birthing, since the teenagers' basic needs such as shelter, food and clothing took precedence over their parenting needs. Additionally, some nurses were perceived to hold judgmental attitudes towards teenage mothers. It was far easier to forestall confrontation with nurses and the other 'older' women clientele by avoiding them. Thus XI they turned to charitable agencies who provided a safety net in the form of emergency supplies of money, food, or equipment. Informal networks of friends provided alternative modes of support when family help failed to materialise. The children, however, provided the young women with an opportunity to transform their lives by breaking free of the past, and by creating a new, mature existence for themselves. Despite being abandoned by family, friends, lovers and society, in the privacy and isolation of their own homes, they attempted to provide a more nurturing environment for their children than they themselves had received. Each bestowed unconditional maternal love on the child and were rewarded through the pleasures of watching their children grow and develop into worthwhile individuals. The children became the focus of their attention and their reason for living. In the course of their welfare dependency, the young women became public property, targets of surveillance, and were subjected to stigmatising and condescending public attitudes wherever they went. In this way, it was evident that they were an oppressed group, but each found ways of resisting. Rather than focussing on their oppressive or disabling lives, or dwelling on their disadvantaged status, the young women sought their identities as mature women through motherhood and by demonstrating that they could do this important job well. Through motherhood their lives had meaning and a sense of purpose. The thesis concludes that motherhood in the teenage years is difficult. However, if appropriate supports are made available, teenage mothers need be no different from non-teenage mothers. But with state resources shrinking, and their own resources limited, teenage mothers are disadvantaged. In some ways, this study showed that all levels of support were inadequate, although those provided through the charitable organizations were seen to be the most appropriate. This reflects the current policy of economic rationalism adopted by most Western liberal democracies in the 1980s and 1990s and no less by the former Keating Labor Government in Australia.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teenage mothers</field><field name="subject">social control</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Welfare state</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031124.175225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women, Words, and Work: A study of change and reconstruction in adult TESOL</field><field name="creator">Angwin, Jennifer</field><field name="description">My dissertation asserts that the discourses which at the present time construct the world of work for teachers in adult TESOL, are no longer adequate to represent the field in these new and rapidly changing times. For the last forty years the discourses that have constructed the field present a totalising, gender free, liberal humanist view of TESOL, rendering women's experience invisible, no longer speaking to or for women teachers who make up more than ninety percent of the teachers in Victorian adult TESOL programs (Cope &amp; Kalantzis 1993, Brodkey 1991, Fine 1992, Peirce 1995). I begin by exploring the work of women teachers in adult TESOL, focusing on women teaching in the fast growing de-institutionalised settings of adult TESOL programs, which remain marginalised from the central programs in terms of administrative policy and practice. I report the findings of a series of projects undertaken by the teachers and the researcher by which new insights and understandings of teachers beliefs about their work and the changes which are currently reconstructing the field of adult language and literacy education in Australia, have been gained. I questions the discourses of applied linguistics which have for the past forty years constructed the field of adult TESOL in Australia and suggests that these lack a social theory (Candlin 1989). From the research findings I questions the possibility of continuing to work in the ways of the past, in the current climate of reconstruction of the field, rapid policy change and continued erosion of resources. I suggest that the previously loose system which held this field of work together, the ways of working, the understandings of practice, have in the light of these new times, been stretched to the limit and are in real danger of collapse. For the women working in TESOL this continued incursion of the systems into their work and the changes that have taken place, the denial of their ways of working, their local knowledge and gendered experiences, can be read against Habermas' concept of the colonisation of the lifeworld of language teaching (Habermas 1987).</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">study</field><field name="subject">reconstruction in adult TESOL</field><field name="subject">gender free</field><field name="subject">liberal humanist view of TESOL</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">applied linguistics</field><field name="subject">language teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031125.085112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MBA EXPERIENCE BY DISTANCE
EDUCATION: AN ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF A
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</field><field name="creator">Holt, Dale M.</field><field name="description">The author's ethnographic study of a professional development program for managers and aspiring managers taught at a distance intends to make a substantial contribution to both the theory and practice of continuing education for professionals. The study focused on a group of Deakin University Master of Business Administration (MBA) participants and their experiences of the final two years of the program. Theorising on the professional development experience was based on data gathered from the direct observation of participants working in their study groups and at residential schools. Moreover, data drawn from end-of-year interviews with participants and discussions with MBA teachers also contributed to the theorising process. Theorising spanned a broad set of interactions encompassing participants' formal educational, professional and personal worlds.
The thesis is devoted to two aspects of the professional development experience, namely: participants' interactions in their study groups and at residential schools; and participants' attempts to grow and develop as competent professional practitioners during their MBA studies.
Interactions with key learning contexts orchestrated by the teaching institution (i.e. study groups and residential schools) are grounded in an analysis of the changing group cultures observed to accommodate the different educational demands of the program. Group interaction on a broader scale is also analysed in the context of the residential schools. The residential school provided a powerful forum for the development of participant activism over the future development of the MBA program. The analysis of the study groups in action led the author to identify the key characteristics of effective educational work groups. The implications of the success of these essentially egalitarian and leaderless groups for the formation of self-managed groups in the workplace is examined.
On the matter of professional development, the author reveals the relationships between the nature of participants' jobs, their search for professional integration, their stage of professional empowerment, the strategies they pursued either to empower themselves or others in their organisations and the barriers which were encountered in the pursuit of empowerment. Dramatic examples of professional disempowerment are analysed indicating that interaction between formal off-the-job learning and professional practice in the workplace is not necessarily a smooth and positive experience. The group of
 
participants studied are seen to be heterogeneous in relation to the above factors characterising professional development
The implications of the theorising are considered in relation to professional pedagogies, assessment strategies and distance education. Distance education is seen to socially construct the roles of both teachers and students in the educational process. Specifically, teachers are seen to be somewhat marginalised during the program in use whereas the participants are located at the centre of the educational experience. The primacy of participants in the educational process is highlighted through the growing reliance on self-and peer-group assessment skills as participants progressed through the program. It is argued that the teaching institution should encourage and maintain the development of these skills as they represent a major learning outcome of the professional development experience, i.e. the ability to engage in the process of critical self-reflection and informed action.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethnographic study</field><field name="subject">Master of Business Administration (MBA)</field><field name="subject">MBA teachers</field><field name="subject">formal education</field><field name="subject">workplace</field><field name="subject">distance education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031125.095402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nursing Work and Nursing Knowledge:
Exploring the Work of Womens' Health Nurses
Patterns of Power and Praxis</field><field name="creator">Leach, Sarah Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The majority of women's health nurses in this study work in generalist community health centres. They have developed their praxis within the philosophy and policies of the broader women's health movement and primary health care principles in Australia. The fundamental assumption underlying this study is that women's health nurses possess a unique body of knowledge and clinical wisdom that has not been previously documented and explored. The epistemological base from which these nurses' operate offers important insights into the substantive issues that create and continually shape the practice world of nurses and their clients. Whether this represents a (re)construction of the dominant forms of health care service delivery for women is examined in this study.
The study specifically aims at exploring the practice issues and experience of women's health service provision by women's health nurses in the context of the provision of cervical cancer screening services. In mapping this particular group of nurses practice, it sets out to examine the professional and theoretical issues in contemporary nursing and women's health care.
In critically analysing the powerful discourses that shape and reshape nursing work, the study raises the concern that previous analyses of pursing work tend to universalise the structural and social subordination of nurses and nursing knowledge. This universalism is most often based on examples of midwifery and nursing work in hospital settings, and subsequently, because of these conceptualisations, all of nursing is too often deemed as a dependent occupation, with little agency, and is analysed as always in relation to medicine, to hospitals, to other knowledge forms.
Denoting certain discourses as dominant proposes a relationship of power and knowledge and the thesis argues that all work relations and practices in health are structured by certain power/knowledge relations. This analysis reveals that there
 
IX
are many competing and complimentary power/knowledge relations that structure nursing, but that nursing, and in particular women's health nurses, also challenge the power/knowledge relations around them. Through examining theories of power and knowledge the analysis, argues that theoretical eclecticism is necessary to address the complex and varied nature of nursing work. In particular it identifies that postmodern and radical feminist theorising provide the most appropriate framework to further analyse and interpret the work of women's health nurses.
Fundamental to the position argued in this thesis is a feminist perspective. This position creates important theoretical and methodological links throughout the whole study. Feminist methodology was employed to guide the design, the collection and the analysis. Intrinsic to this process was the use of the 'voices' of women's health nurses as the basis for theorising. The 'voices' of these nurses are highlighted in the chapters as italicised bold script. A constant companion along the way in examining women's health nurses' work, was the reflexivity with feminist research processes, the theoretical discussions and their 'voices'. Capturing and analysing descriptive accounts of nursing praxis is seen in this thesis as providing a way to theorise about nursing work. This methodology is able to demonstrate the knowledge forms embedded in clinical nursing praxis.
Three conceptual threads emerge throughout the discussions: one focuses on nursing praxis as a distinct process, with its own distinct epistemological base rather than in relation to 'other' knowledge forms; another describes the medical restriction and opposition as experienced by this group of nurses, but also of their resistance to medical opposition. The third theme apparent from the interviews, and which was conceptualised as beyond resistance, was the description of the alternative discourses evident in nursing work, and this focused on notions of being a professional and on autonomous nursing praxis.
This study concludes that rather than accepting the totalising discourses about nursing there are examples within nursing of resistance&#151;both ideologically and
 
X
in practice&#151;to these dominant discourses. Women's health nurses represent an important model of women's health service delivery, an analysis of which can contribute to critically reflecting on the 'paradigm of oppression' cited in nursing and about nursing more generally. Reflecting on women's health service delivery also has relevance in today's policy environment, where structural shifts in Commonwealth/State funding arrangements in community based care, may undermine women's health programs.
In summary this study identifies three important propositions for nursing:
&#149;	nursing praxis can reconstruct traditional models of health care;
&#149;	nursing praxis is powerful and able to 'resist' dominant discourses; and
&#149;	nursing praxis can be transformative.
Joining feminist perspectives and alternative analyses of power provides a pluralistic and emancipatory politics for viewing, describing and analysing 'other' nursing work. At the micro sites of power and knowledge relations&#151;in the everyday practice worlds of nurses, of negotiation and renegotiation, of work on the margins and at the centre&#151;women's health nurses' praxis operates as a positive, productive and reconstructive force in health care.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Commonwealth/State</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">health care</field><field name="subject">hospitals</field><field name="subject">community health centres</field><field name="subject">radical feminist theory</field><field name="subject">resistance to medical opposition</field><field name="subject">nursing praxis</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031126.084144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Doctoral Research and Scholarly
Communication: Candidates, Supervisors and Information Literacy</field><field name="creator">Macauley, Peter Duncan</field><field name="description">This study investigates information literacy and scholarly communication within the processes of doctoral research and supervision at a distance. Both doctoral candidates and supervisors acknowledge information literacy deficiencies and it is suggested that disintermediation and the proliferation of information may contribute to those deficiencies. Further to this, the influence of pedagogic continuity&#151;particularly in relation to the information seeking behaviour of candidates&#151;is investigated, as is the concomitant aspect of how doctoral researchers practise scholarly communication. The well-documented and enduring problem for candidates of isolation from the research cultures of their universities is also scrutinised. The contentious issue of more formally involving librarians in the doctoral process is also considered, from the perspective of candidates and supervisors. Superimposed upon these topical and timely issues is the theoretical framework of adult learning theory, in particular the tenets of andragogy. The pedagogical-andragogical orientation of candidates and supervisors is established, demonstrating both the differences and similarities between candidates and supervisors, as are a number of independent variables, including a comparison of on-campus and off-campus candidates. Other independent variables include age, gender, DETYA (Department of Education, Training &amp; Youth Affairs) category, enrolment type, stage of candidature, employment and status, type of doctorate, and English/non-English speaking background. The research methodology uses qualitative and quantitative techniques encompassing both data and methodological triangulation. The study uses two sets of questionnaires and a series of in-depth interviews with a sample of on-campus and off-campus doctoral candidates and supervisors from four Australian universities. Major findings include NESB candidates being more pedagogical than their ESB counterparts, and candidates and supervisors from the Sciences are more pedagogical than those from Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, or Education. Candidates make a transition from a more dependent and pedagogically oriented approach to learning towards more of an independent and andragogical orientation over the duration of their candidature. However, over tune both on-campus and off-campus candidates become more isolated from the research cultures of their universities, and less happy with support received from their supervisors in relation to their literature reviews.
 
Ill
The study found large discrepancies in perception between the support supervisors believed they gave to candidates in relation to the literature review, and the support candidates believed they received. Information seeking becomes easier over time, but candidates face a dilemma with the proliferation of information, suggesting that disintermediation has exacerbated the challenges of evaluation and organisation of information. The concept of pedagogic continuity was recognised by supervisors and especially candidates, both negative and positive influences. The findings are critically analysed and synthesised using the metaphor of a scholarly 'Club' of which obtaining a doctorate is a rite of passage. Recommendations are made for changes in professional practice, and topics that may warrant further research are suggested.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="subject">information literarcy</field><field name="subject">librarians</field><field name="subject">adult learning theory</field><field name="subject">DETYA (Department of Education</field><field name="subject">Training &amp; Youth Affairs)</field><field name="subject">English/non-english speaking background</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">scholarly 'Club'</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031126.085927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The PHENOMENON OF ORDINARINESS IN NURSING</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Beverley J.</field><field name="description">This phenomenological research aimed to illuminate the nature and effects of ordinariness in nursing and to discover whether the phenomenon enhanced the nursing encounter.
The researcher worked as a participant observer with six registered nurses in a Professorial Nursing Unit. Following each interaction, the researcher wrote her impressions in a personal-professional journal and audiotaped conversations with the respective nurses and patients to gain their impressions.
Using a theoretical framework of the phenomenological concepts of lived experience, Dasein, Being-in-the-world and fusion of horizons as an underpinning methodology, an initial hermeneutical analysis and interpretation of the impressions generated qualities and activities indicative of the aspects of the phenomenon of ordinariness in nursing.
The second phase of the analysis and interpretation sought to illuminate the nature of the phenomenon itself. Eight actualities of the nature of the phenomenon emerged: 'allowingness,' 'straightforwardness,' 'self-likeness,' 'homeliness,' 'favourableness,' 'intuneness,' 'lightheartedness' and 'connectedness.' These actualities were described in relation to the phenomenon of interest.
The effects of the phenomenon were the creative potential to enhance the nursing encounter and included many and various effects of facilitation, fair play, familiarity, family, favouring, feelings, fun and friendship.
The research found that nurses and patients shared a common sense of humanity, which enhanced the nursing encounter. Within the context of caring, the nurses were ordinary people, perceived as being extraordinarily effective, by the very ways in which their humanness shone through their knowledge and skills, to make their whole being with patients something more than just professional helping. The shared sense of ordinariness between nurses and patients made them as one in then- humanness and created a special place, in which the relative strangeness of the experience of being in a health care setting, could be made familiar and manageable.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phenomenological research</field><field name="subject">Professorial Nursing unit</field><field name="subject">hermeneutical analysis</field><field name="subject">allowingness</field><field name="subject">straightfordness</field><field name="subject">self-likeness</field><field name="subject">homeliness</field><field name="subject">intuneness</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031128.082904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE LIPID COMPOSITION OF CASHMERE GOAT FIBRES</field><field name="creator">Hillbrick, Gordon Colin</field><field name="description">This study examined the differences in the chemical composition, particularly fatty acids, of the lipid extracted from the fibre of bucks, does and castrated goats.  The study provides a more detailed understanding of the chemical composition of buck fibre lipid and how it varies throughout the year, and also details the effect of body region and nutrition on the production and chemical composition of lipid from buck fibre.
Lipid was extracted with either petroleum ether (non-polar) or chloroform/methanol azeotrope (polar) and analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The more polar solvent system extracted larger amounts of lipid and more of each individual fatty acid. The following buck specific ethyl branched fatty acids were identified: 2-ethylhexanoic, 4-ethylhexanoic, 2-ethyloctanoic, 4-ethyloctanoic, 6-ethyloctanoic, 2-ethyldecanoic, 4-ethyldecanoic, 2-ethyldodecanoic, 6-ethyldodecanoic, 4-ethyldodecanoic, 2-ethyltetradecanoic, 6-ethyltetradecanoic, 4-ethyltetradecanoic, 2-ethylhexadecanoic and 4-ethyloctadecanoic acids.  Of these buck specific fatty acids only 4-ethylhexanoic (T), 4-ethyloctanoic, 4-ethyldecanoic, 4-ethyldodecanoic, 6-ethyldodecanoic (T), 4-ethyltetradecanoic, 2-ethylhexadecanoic (T) and 4-ethylhexadecanoic acids have been previously identified or tentatively identified (T) in buck fibre extracts.  This shows that the chemical composition of buck fibre lipid is more complex than previously reported, and that it may be more difficult than previously thought to artificially duplicate the odour of the buck.
Buck fibre samples had lower average
concentrations of 2-methylpropanoic, 2-methylbutanoic, iso-pentadecanoic, anteiso-pentadecanoic, iso-hexadecanoic, anteiso-heptadecanoic, iso-octadecanoic and anteiso-nonadecanoic acids as compared with fibre samples from does, spayed does, or wethers that were castrated at one month of age.  The reduced concentrations of these fatty acids in buck fibre extracts were likely to be due to the synthesis of ethyl branched derivatives of iso and anteiso fatty acids.  Buck fibre samples had higher concentrations of benzoic acid as compared with fibre samples from does, spayed does, or wethers that were castrated at one month of age. The significance of these results is that non buck specific fatty acids may also make a contribution to the odour of bucks.
When fibre samples were collected at various times throughout the year, it was found that the bucks had increased amounts of lipid and ethyl branched fatty acids in fibre samples shorn from March to September, as compared with fibre samples shorn in November and January.  The increase in the amount of lipid and ethyl branched fatty acids corresponded with both the rutting period of the buck and the period when the buck odour was increased.  This suggests that ethyl branched fatty acids could be pheromones.
The variation in lipid content and fatty acid composition was also examined between fibre samples collected from different body regions of the buck during April, as alterations in sebaceous gland activity around the neck during rutting have been reported.  It was found that the average amount of lipid in the neck region of the bucks was not statistically higher than the average amounts in the midside and hind regions. However, the ethyl branched fatty acid concentrations were statistically higher in the fibre from around the neck as compared with the fibre from the other body regions, which is consistent with the odour of the buck being most pronounced around the head and neck region. 
The lipid content and composition of fibre samples from bucks fed high and low quality diets (lucerne and pangola grass, respectively) was examined to determine the effect of nutrition on buck specific components.  The high quality diet increased the amount of lipid and ethyl branched fatty acids in fibre samples collected in April from the neck, midside and hind regions, as compared with fibre samples from the corresponding body regions from bucks fed the low quality diet.  Thus it may be possible for the pheromone levels of bucks to be increased by simply providing them with good nutrition.
The lipid content and ethyl branched fatty acid concentrations of fibre samples increased earlier in the year for the lucerne fed bucks as compared with the pangola grass fed bucks.  The lucerne fed bucks had increased concentrations of ethyl branched fatty acids in fibre samples shorn during December to June (6 months) whereas the pangola grass fed bucks had increased concentrations of ethyl branched fatty acids in fibre samples shorn during April to August (4 months). These observations show that good nutrition can result in both the earlier production of ethyl branched fatty acids and an extended period when ethyl branched fatty acids are produced.  This suggests that nutrition can be used to manipulate pheromone levels in the buck.  The period when the ethyl branched fatty acids were increased corresponded with the period when the plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone concentrations, odour and sebaceous gland volume of the bucks were increased, which supports the assumption that ethyl branched fatty acids are involved in odour production and act as pheromones.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lipid compositions</field><field name="subject">cashmere</field><field name="subject">goats</field><field name="subject">fibres</field><field name="subject">fatty acids</field><field name="subject">testosterone</field><field name="subject">bucks</field><field name="subject">pheromones</field><field name="subject">pangola grass</field><field name="subject">lucerne feed</field><field name="subject">diet</field><field name="subject">non-polar</field><field name="subject">polar</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031205.162817</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescent girls in physical education and sport: An analysis of influences on participation</field><field name="creator">Whitty, Julia Mary</field><field name="description">This study investigates the influences on participation in physical activity of thirty adolescent girls from a metropolitan secondary school in Victoria. It seeks to understand how they perceived, experienced and explained their involvement or non involvement in both competitive and non competitive physical activity during four years of their secondary schooling. Participants experienced physical education as both a single sex group in Years 7 and 9 and a coeducational group in Years 8 and 10. They were exposed to a predominantly competitive curriculum in Years 7 to 9 and a less structured, more social, recreational program in Year 10. These experiences enabled them to compare the differences between class structures and activity programs and identify the significant issues which impacted on their participation.
Large Australian population studies have revealed that fewer girls participated in sport and regular physical activity than boys. An important consequence is that girls miss out on the health benefits associated with participating in physical activity. Other research has found adolescence is the time that girls drop out of competitive sport. However, an important issue is whether girls who drop out of competitive sport cease to be involved in any physical activity. There are some studies which have reported good participation rates by adolescent girls in non competitive, recreational forms of physical activity and the possibility exists that they may drop out of competitive and into non competitive physical activity.
This study primarily utilises a qualitative approach in contrast to previous studies which have largely relied upon the use of surveys and questionnaires. Whilst quantitative research has provided useful information about the bigger picture, there are limitations caused by reliance on the researchers' own interpretations of the data. Additionally there is no opportunity for any clarification and explanation of findings and trends by the respondents themselves.
 
The current study utilized qualitative individual and collective interviews in three stages. Questions were asked in the broad areas of coeducation and single sex classes, preferences for competitive or recreational activity and body image issues. Some quantitative information focusing on nature and extent of current activity patterns was also gathered in the first stage. Thirty Year 10 girls participated in individual first interviews. Nine selected girls then took part in the second (individual) and third (collective) interview stages. Results revealed three groups based on the nature of physical activity involvement: [1] competitive activity group, [2] social activity group and [3] transition group. The transition group represented those who were in the process of withdrawing from competitive sport to take up more non competitive, recreational activity.
The most significant difference between groups was skill level. On the whole those entering adolescence with the highest skill levels, such as those in the competitive group, were the most confident and relished competing against others. The social group was low in skill and confidence and had predominantly negative experiences in physical education and sport because their deficiencies were plainly visible to all. Similarly, a lack of skill improvement relative to those of 'better performers' affected the interest and confidence levels of those in the transition group.
Boys' domination in coeducational classes through verbal and physical intimidation of the less competent and confident girls and exclusion of very competent girls was a major issue. Social and transition group members demonstrated compliance with boys' power by hanging back and sitting out of competitive activities. Conversely, the competitive group resisted boy's attempts to dominate but had to work hard to demonstrate their athletic capabilities in order to do so.
Body image issues such as the skimpy physical education and sport uniform along with body revealing activities such as swimming and gymnastics, heightened feelings of self-consciousness and embarrassment for most girls. When strategies were adopted by social and transition group members to avoid any body exposure or physical humiliation, participation levels were subsequently affected. However, where girls felt confident about their physical abilities and body image, they were able to ignore their unflattering uniforms and thus participation was unaffected.
Specific teaching practices such as giving more attention to boys, for example by segregating the sexes in mixed classes to focus attention on boys, reinforced stereotypical notions of gender and contributed to the inequities for girls in physical education. The competitive group were frustrated with having to prove themselves as capable as boys in order to receive greater teacher attention. The transition group rejected teacher's attempts to coerce them into participating in the inter school sports program.  The social group believed that teachers viewed and treated them less favourably than others because of their limited skills.
Girls were not passive in the face of these obstacles. Rather than give up physical activity they disengaged from competitive sport and took up other forms of activity which they had the confidence to perform. These activity choices also reflected their expanding social interests such as spending time with male and female friends outside school and increased demands on their time by study and part time work commitments.
This study not only highlighted the diversity and complexity of attitudes and behaviours of girls towards physical activity but also demonstrated that they display agency in making conscious, sensible decisions about their physical activity choices.

Adolescent girls in physical education and sport; An analysis of influences on
participation

This study investigates the influences on participation in physical activity of thirty adolescent girls from a metropolitan secondary school in Victoria in order to understand how girls' perceived, experienced and explained their involvement or non involvement in both competitive and non competitive physical activity.
Qualitative individual and collective interviews were conducted. Questions focussed on attitudes about coeducation and single sex classes, preferences for competitive or recreational activity and feelings about body image. Some quantitative information about the nature and extent of current activity patterns was also gathered in the first stage. Thirty Year 10 girls participated in individual first interviews. Nine selected girls then took part in the second (individual) and third (collective) interview stages.
Results revealed three clearly different groups based on the nature of physical activity involvement (1) Competitive, (2) Social and (3) Transition (those in the process of withdrawing from competitive sport to take up more non competitive, recreational activity). The major difference between groups was skill level. Those entering adolescence with the highest skill levels were more competent and confident in the coeducational and competitive sport setting. Other significant issues included boys' domination, body image and teaching behaviours and practices.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">girls</field><field name="subject">competitive sport</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">adolescent girls</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">population</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031205.165926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">QUALITY AS THE CRITERION FOR DELIVERED INFORMATION SYSTEMS EFFECTIVENESS</field><field name="creator">Wilkin, Carla Lesley</field><field name="description">One of the major challenges of MIS activities is the difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of delivered systems. The principal purpose of my research is to explore this field in order to develop an instrument by which to measure such effectiveness. Conceptualisation of Information System (IS) Effectiveness has been substantially framed by DeLone and McLean's (1992) Success; Model. But with the innovation in Information Technology (IT) over the past decade, and the constant pressure in IT to improve performance, there is merit in undertaking a fresh appraisal of the issue.
This study built on the model of IS Success developed by DeLone and MeLean, but was broadened to include related research from the domains of IS, Management and Marketing. This analysis found that an effective IS function is built on three pillars: the systems implemented; the information held and delivered by these systems; and, the service provided in support of the IS function. A common foundation for these pillars is the concept of stakeholder needs. In seeking to appreciate the effectiveness: of delivered IS applications in relation to the job performance of stakeholders, this research developed an understanding of what quality means in an IT context I argue that quality is a more useful criterion for effectiveness than the more customary measures of use and user satisfaction. Respecification of the IS Success Model was then proposed.
The second phase of the research was to test this model empirically through judgment panels, focus groups and interviews. Results consistently supported the structure and components of the respecified model. Quality was determined as a multi-dimensional construct, with the key dimensions for the quality of delivered IS differing from those used in the research from other disciplines. Empirical work indicated that end-user stakeholders derived their evaluations of quality by internally evaluating perceived performance of delivered IS in relation to their expectations for such performance. A short trial explored whether, when overt measurement of expectations was concurrent with the measurement of perceptions, a more revealing
 
appraisal of delivered IS quality was provided than when perceptions alone were measured. Results revealed a difference between the two measures.
Using the New IS Success Model as the foundation, and drawing upon the related theoretical and empirical research, an instrument was developed to measure the quality/effectiveness of delivered IS applications. Four trials of this instrument, QUALIT, are documented. Analysis of results from preliminary trials indicates promise in terms of business value: the instrument is simple to administer and has the capacity to pinpoint areas of weakness.
The research related to the respecification of the New IS Success Model and the associated empirical studies, including the development of QTJALIT, have both contributed to the development of theory about IS Effectiveness. More precisely, my research has reviewed the components of an information system, the dimensions comprising these components and the indicators of each, and based upon these findings, formulated an instrument by which to measure the effectiveness of a delivered IS.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information Systems (IS)</field><field name="subject">Information Technology (IT)</field><field name="subject">stakeholders</field><field name="subject">DeLone and McLean</field><field name="subject">QUALIT</field><field name="subject">business values</field><field name="subject">management and marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031205.172039</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk and the Regulation of Youth(ful) Identities in an Age of Manufactured Uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Peter</field><field name="description">The Question(s) of Youth, of what to do with them, of how to school them, or police them, or regulate them, or house them, or employ them, or prevent them from becoming involved in any number of Risky (sexual, eating, drug (ab)using or peer cultural) practices are questions which have a substantial historical aspect. In the Liberal Democracies at the end of the millennium the Crisis of Youth (at-Risk) is a key marker in theoretical, political and popular debates about Youth. This thesis explores the 'conditions of possibility' which enable discourses of Youth at-Risk to function as true (Henriques et al 1984). I argue that the truth of Youth at-Risk rehearses, in part, the historical truths of Youth as Delinquent, Deviant and Disadvantaged. I will also argue that a historically novel aspect of the truth of Youth at-Risk is that, potentially, every behaviour, every practice, every group of Youth can be constructed in terms of Risk. 

This thesis is not about the practices, behaviours and dispositions of young people. Rather, my concern is with the ways in which institutionally structured processes of expert knowledge production construct the truths of Youth (at-Risk). The thesis is concerned with the processes by which these largely autonomous systems of expert knowledge production are constitutive of both the 'institutional reflexivity' which characterises contemporary settings, and the forms of identity which emerge in these settings (Giddens 1994 c). I am also concerned with the ways in which these systems of expertise mobilise categories of Risk in diverse attempts to regulate the behaviours and dispositions of certain populations of young people under the conditions of 'reflexive modernization' (Beck, Giddens &amp; Lash 1994).

The thesis argues for a productive convergence between theories of reflexive modernization and governmentality. This convergence enables Youth at-Risk to be examined at two (interconnected) levels. In the first instance Risk is understood as constituting a metanarrative in an Age of Manufactured Uncertainty. In the second instance the identification of Risk factors and populations at-Risk will be understood as techniques mobilised in diverse attempts to 'make up' rational, choice making, autonomous, responsible citizens within (Neo)Liberal projects of government (Rose 1996). 

Foucault's (1991) theory of governmentality foregrounds the practices and relations implicated in the processes whereby 'human beings are made into subjects' (Foucault 1983). Governmentality is a useful and strategic analytic for understanding the diverse attempts by various experts and centres of expertise to regulate young people's identity through the construction of populations of Youth at-Risk.

Processes of reflexive modernization are marked by the emergence of a degree of collective awareness that our contemporary conditions of existence are characterised by the thoroughgoing penetration of the social and the natural by reflexive human knowledge. Such a situation leads, not to a position in 'which collectively we are the masters [sic] of our destiny'; but rather to a series of settings in which we are confronted with the possibility that, as a 'consequence of our own doings', the future becomes 'very threatening' (Beck, Giddens &amp; Lash 1994).

In problematising the truth of Youth at-Risk this thesis will also engage with various problematisations of Left (critical) intellectual and political practices in domains which take Youth as their object. This thesis is explicitly located in the space of 'critical' (Educational) scholarship in Anglo settings which is structured, historically, by the 'European Marxist social philosophy' of the Frankfurt School and Gramscian (British) Cultural Studies, and French and Italian Feminism and Post (Structuralism and Modernism) (Popkewitz and Brennan 1997). The thesis argues that in order to problematise the truth of Youth at-Risk it is necessary, also, to problematise the processes of truth production mobilised from the Left in an engagement with the material and discursive realities which enable Youth at-Risk to function as a truth. Examining the truth of Youth at-Risk in the frameworks enabled by a convergence of theories of reflexive modernization and governmentality is a contribution to the processes of rethinking the intellectual and political positions which the Left might mobilise at the end of the millennium, when, as Beck (1994 ) argues, 'uncertainty returns'. I will argue that Left  intellectual and political practice has no choice but to be open to the uncertain nature of truth telling which characterises processes of reflexive modernization. The tensions generated within these processes are not resolvable. Nor should the 'return of uncertainty' be seen as immobilising in the context of political and intellectual practice. 

The thesis argues that theories of reflexive modernization and governmentality highlight the dangers of intellectual and political positions which invest heavily in 'modernity's war on ambivalence' (Bauman 1990 b). In settings where the practices and activities of expertise have so thoroughly penetrated the natural and the social, where these processes of colonisation have resulted in the 'return of uncertainty', then the practices and activities of expertise promise, paradoxically, to 'exterminate ambivalence' by telling the truths of Youth at-Risk (Bauman 1990 b). This thesis argues that in an Age of Manufactured Uncertainty the mobilisation of rationally grounded Risk discourses in attempts to regulate Youth emerges as a paradoxical, and dangerous, Quest for Certainty (Bauman 1990 a).</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">governmentality</field><field name="subject">reflexive modernization</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20031212.114212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Helping teachers surf the Information and
Communication Technology tsunami</field><field name="creator">Burgan, Owen T.S.</field><field name="description">A range of factors, both internal and external, is creating changes in teaching and
teachers&#146; professional lives. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is
just one of the major changes impacting on the teaching profession. As teachers face
intense pressure to adapt to this tsunami, this study aims to investigate ways in which
teachers can be helped. In South Australia, where this study is set, all teachers in
Government schools are expected to be 
"ICT Smart", i.e. able to use appropriate
forms of ICT to enhance the teaching and learning environment of their classrooms.
From the researcher&#146;s involvement for over a decade in professional development for
teachers, and from visits to many schools, it appears that numerous teachers have not
reached this standard. The greatest need is in Reception to Year 7 schools where the
average age of teachers is nearly 50. Because no state-wide data exists, this study is
intended to establish if there is a problem and if there is, to identify specific needs
and offer possible solutions.
The study is comprised of four parts: Part A, the Introduction gives an overview of
the inter-relationships between these parts and the overall Folio. It establishes the
setting and provides a rationale for the study and its focus on Professional
Development in Information and Communication Technology. Part B, the Elective
Research Studies, follows the writer&#146;s involvement in this field since the 1980s. It
establishes the theme of "Moving best practice in ICT from the few to the many"
which underlies the whole study. Part C, the Dissertation, traces the steps taken to
investigate the need for professional development in ICT. This is achieved by
analysing and commenting on data collected from a state-wide survey and a series of
interviews with leading figures, and by providing a review of the relevant literature
and past and existing models of professional development. Part D, Final Comments,
provides an overview of the whole Folio and a reflection on the research that has
been conducted.
The findings are that there is widespread dissatisfaction with existing models and
that there is an urgent need for professional development in this area, because nearly
20% of teachers either do not use computers or are considered to be novice users.
Another 25% are considered to be below not yet "ICT Smart". Less than 10% of ICT
co-ordinators have a formal qualification in the field but more than 85% of them are
interested in a Masters program.
The study offers solutions in Part B where there is a discussion of a range of
strategies to provide on-going professional development for teachers. Chapter 9
provides an outline of a proposed Masters level program and offers suggestions on
how it could be best delivered. This program would meet the identified needs of ICT
co-ordinators.
The study concludes with a series of recommendations and suggestions for further
research. The Education Department must address these urgent professional
development needs of teachers, particularly those in the more remote country
regions. There needs to be a follow-up survey to establish to what extent teachers in
South Australia are now "ICT Smart

This metal forming process has been extensively used by the automotive industry to manufacture both car panels and parts. Over the years numerous investigations have been conducted on various aspects of the manufacturing process with varied success. In recent years the requirements on the sheet metal forming industry have headed towards improved stability in the forming process while lowering environmental burdens. Therefore the overall aim of this research was to identify a technique for developing lubricant formulations that are insensitive to the sheet metal forming process.
Due to the expense of running experiments on production presses and to improve time efficiency of the process the evaluation procedure was required to be performed in a laboratory. Preliminary investigations in the friction/lubricant system identified several laboratory tests capable of measuring lubricant performance and their interaction with process variables. However, little was found on the correlation between laboratory tests and production performance of lubricants. Therefore the focus of the research switched to identifying links between the performance of lubricants in a production environment and laboratory tests. To reduce the influence of external parameters all significant process variables were identified and included in the correlation study to ensure that lubricant formulations could be desensitised to all significant variables.
The significant process variables were found to be sensitive to die position, for
instance: contact pressure, blank coating of the strips and surface roughness of the dies were found significant for the flat areas of the die while no variables affected friction when polished drawbeads were used. The next phase was to identify the interaction between the significant variables and the main lubricant ingredient groups. Only the fatty material ingredient group (responsible for the formation of boundary lubricant regimes) was found to significantly influence friction with no interaction between the ingredient groups. The influence of varying this ingredient group was then investigated in a production part and compared to laboratory results.
The correlation between production performance and laboratory tests was found to be test dependant. With both the Flat Face Friction test and the Drawbead Simulator unaffected by changes in the lubricant formulation, while the Flat Bottom Cup test showing similar results as the production trial. It is believed that the lack of correlation between the friction tests and the production performance of the lubricant is due to the absence of bulk plastic deformation of the strip. For this reason the Ohio State University (OSU) friction test was incorporated in the lubricant evaluation procedure along with a Flat Bottom Cup test.
Finally, it is strongly believed that if the lubricant evaluation procedure highlighted in this research is followed then lubricant formulations can be developed confidently in the laboratory.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheet metal forming</field><field name="subject">lubricants</field><field name="subject">automotive industry</field><field name="subject">manufacture</field><field name="subject">car panels</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">contact pressure</field><field name="subject">blank coating</field><field name="subject">dies</field><field name="subject">Flat Face Friction</field><field name="subject">drawbead simulator</field><field name="subject">Flat Bottom Cup test</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040428.095238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Geelong Community's Priorities
and Expectations of Public Health Care</field><field name="creator">Capp, Stan</field><field name="description">Abstract
This thesis set out to achieve the following objectives:
(1) To identify the priorities and expectations that the Geelong community has of its public health care system.
(2) To determine if there is a common view on the attributes of a just health system.
(3) To consider a method of utilising the data in the determination of health care priority setting in Barwon Health.
(4) To determine a model of community participation which enables ongoing input into the decision making processes of Barwon Health.

The methodology involved a combination of qualitative and quantitative research. The qualitative work involved the use of focus groups that were conducted with 64 members of the Geelong community. The issues raised informed the development of the interview schedule that was the basis of the quantitative study, which surveyed a representative sample of 400 members of the Geelong community. Prior to reporting on this work, the areas of distributive justice, scarcity and community participation in health care were considered. The research found that timely access to public hospitals, emergency care and aged care services were the major priorities; for many people, the cost was less relevant than a quality service. Shorter waiting times and increased staffing levels were strongly supported. Increased taxes were nominated as the best means of financing the health system they sought. Community based services were less relevant than hospital services but health education was supported. An egalitarian approach to resource distribution was favoured although the community was prepared to discriminate in favour of younger people and against older people. There was strong support for the community to be involved in decision making in the public health care system through surveys or focus groups but very little support was given to priorities being determined by politicians, administrators and to a lesser extent, medical professionals.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geelong</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">public health care</field><field name="subject">data</field><field name="subject">Barwon Health</field><field name="subject">distributive justice</field><field name="subject">scarcity</field><field name="subject">timely acces to public hospitals</field><field name="subject">community based services</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="subject">focus groups &amp; medical proffessionals</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040505.114253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intertextual turns in curriculum inquiry: fictions, diffractions and deconstructions</field><field name="creator">Gough, Noel Patrick</field><field name="description">This thesis is based primarily on work published in academic refereed journals between 1994 and 2003. Taken as a whole, the thesis explores and enacts an evolving methodology for curriculum inquiry which foregrounds the generativity of fiction in reading, writing and representing curriculum problems and issues. This methodology is informed by the narrative and textual 'turns' in the humanities and social sciences - especially poststructuralist and deconstructive approaches to literary and cultural criticism - and is performed as a series of narrative experiments and 'intertextual turns'. Narrative theory suggests that we can think of all discourse as taking the form of a story, and poststructuralist theorising invites us to think of all discourse as taking the form of a text; this thesis argues that intertextual and deconstructive readings of the stories and texts that constitute curriculum work can produce new meanings and understandings. The thesis places particular emphasis on the uses of fiction and fictional modes of representation in curriculum inquiry and suggests that our purposes might sometimes be better served by (re)presenting  the texts we produce as deliberate fictions rather than as 'factual' stories. The thesis also demonstrates that some modes and genres of fiction  can help us to move our research efforts beyond 'reflection' (an optical metaphor for displacing an image) by producing texts that 'diffract' the normative storylines of curriculum inquiry (diffraction is an optical metaphor for transformation). The thesis begins with an introduction that situates (autobiographically and historically) the narrative experiments and intertextual turns performed in the thesis as both advancements in, and transgressions of, deliberative and critical reconceptualist curriculum theorising. Several of the chapters that follow examine textual continuities and discontinuities between the various objects and methods of curriculum inquiry and particular fictional genres (such as crime stories and science fiction) and/or particular fictional works (including Bram Stoker's Dracula, J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace, and Ursula Le Guin's The Telling). Other chapters demonstrate how intertextual and deconstructive reading strategies can inform inquiries focused on specific subject matters (with particular reference to environmental education) and illuminate contemporary issues and debates in curriculum (especially the internationalisation and globalisation of curriculum work). The thesis concludes with suggestions for further refinement of methodologies that privilege narrative and fiction in curriculum inquiry.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">curriculum inquiry</field><field name="subject">narrative theory</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">poststructuralism</field><field name="subject">deconstruction</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040517.163306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inclusive schooling : contexts, texts and politics</field><field name="creator">Moss, Julianne</field><field name="description">The title &#145;Inclusive schooling: contexts, texts and politics&#146;, names a thesis which critically analyses the development of inclusive schooling in the small Australian Island state of Tasmania between 1996 and 1998. The &#145;Inclusion of Students with Disabilities&#146; policy, introduced in 1995 by the Tasmanian Department of Education, Community and Cultural Development, provides an opportunity to understand the cultural context and politics of change in schooling over this period.

The qualitative methodology deployed here is informed by poststructuralism and captures the everyday experiences of university teaching as a research site. The teacher/researcher as the visible maker of the research use metaphors of fibre and textile practice, techniques of textual juxtaposition and her positioned subjectivity as a female academic to tell a 'big story'. The researcher develops a 'double method' as a possible model for Inclusive research practice and educational policy analysis. 

Using a critical ethnographic method, derived from the work of Carspecken (1996), 'data stories' 
(Lather &amp; Smithies 1997, p.34) are produced from the narratives of five key informants &#150; a parent, two teachers, a policy-maker and the researcher. Assembled as the data of the thesis the multi-voiced texts provide an account of the sociocultural, professional and systemic context of Inclusive schooling over a three-year period. In the analysis these data are interpreted from a feminist poststructural standpoint. 

A deconstructuive reading of the data stories interprets the discourse of inclusive schooling emphasising the dominant foundation of the special education knowledge tradition. The idea of author function (after Foucault 1975, 1984b and Grundy and Hatton 1995) is used to interpret the 'texts' of the key Informants as discursive constructions. The researcher theorises inclusive schooling as   an entangled, multiple and contradictory discourse, embedded in the social, cultural and material contexts, rather than a singular unitary Idea of the progress within the special education knowledge tradition. 

The study contributes a fine-grained analysis of the constructed knowledge of inclusive schooling in one locality. The thesis advocates continuing engagement with questions of epistemology and social transformation in inclusive schooling, rather than persisting with technical rationality and the status quo.  The researcher takes the position that the opportunities to theorise inclusive schooling lie within the multiple and disparate constructed texts of the micro world of everyday practice and the macro understanding of understandings of contemporary social justice. The poststructuralist writing/reading questions traditionalist theorising in the special education field. Central to the negotiations of power and truth inclusive schooling research and practice is a communicative theory that transforms populist conceptions of inclusion.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inclusive schooling</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">university teaching</field><field name="subject">special education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040524.162132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination of the Validity and Usefulness of The Video Suggestibility Scale For Children.</field><field name="creator">McFarlane, Felicity Jane</field><field name="description">The Video Suggestibility Scale for Children (VSSC) was developed by Scullin and colleagues (Scullin &amp; Ceci, 2000; Scullin &amp; Hembrooke, 1998) as a tool for discriminating between children who have different levels of suggestibility. The scale requires children to view a 5-minute video about a birthday party, and to subsequently participate in an interview consisting of 18 yes/no questions. The VSSC consists of two main subscales; Yield (a measure of children's willingness to respond affirmatively to misleading questions about the video) and Shift (a measure of the children's tendency to change their responses after negative feedback from the interviewer). Preliminary research by Scullin and colleagues suggested that the scale possesses satisfactory internal consistency and that children's scores on the VSSC can predict their performance in another suggestibility paradigm.
This thesis presents two studies, which further examine the validity and usefulness of the VSSC in an Australian sample of 3- to-5-year-old children. In Study One, children's performance on the VSSC (N = 77) was compared to their performance using other measures of suggestibility. These measures included children's willingness to assent to a false event as well as the number of false interviewer suggestions and new false details that the children provided in their accounts about an independent true-biased and an independent false (non-experienced) event. An independent samples t-test revealed that those children who assented to the false activity generated higher scores on the Yield measure. This pattern was also observed for the Shift subscale although it was not significant. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that Yield was a significant predictor of the number of false details reported about the false activity, but not the true-biased activity. There was no significant relationship between the Shift
 
Vlll
subscale and any of the dependent variables. Overall this study provided partial support for the construct validity of the VSSC. However, it indicated that children's performance on this scale may not be generalisable across different contexts and interview paradigms, and that the Yield subscale is more generalisable than the Shift subscale.
Study Two examined whether various group and individual factors that have previously been shown to relate suggestibility (i.e., age, IQ, memory, socio-economic status, gender, temperament) could predict suggestibility as measured by the VSSC. Two hundred and twenty children were recruited from kindergartens, and were divided into two broad socio-economic categories (based predominantly on income). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that age, intelligence and memory inversely predicted children's Yield suggestibility. Further, children of low socio-economic backgrounds were more suggestible than children of high socio-economic background, and boys were more suggestible than girls on the Yield measure. Although shyness and other internalised and externalised characteristics were explored, no reliable significant relationships were found with Yield. With regard to the Shift subscale, no reliable relationships were found for any of the independent variables except for SES. Overall, results of Study 2 indicated that the VSSC is a potentially useful measure for discriminating between children's suggestibility on the basis on their individual characteristics, although benefits were observed mainly in relation to the Yield subscale. With reference to the findings of these two studies, the potential contribution of the VSSC for research and applied forensic contexts was discussed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Video Suggestibility Scale for Children (VSSC)</field><field name="subject">discrimination</field><field name="subject">examination</field><field name="subject">validity</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">hierarchical regression</field><field name="subject">IQ</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">socio-economic status</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">temperament.</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040604.172637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insider Research, the Process and Practice: Issues arising from professionals conducting research within their own working environments.</field><field name="creator">Humphrey, Bryan</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the chaotic, dynamic, ambiguous, complex and confusing world of the insider researcher.  The proliferating species of insider researcher is common in public sector organisations and is particularly prevalent among post-graduate students who have combined study with work.  Insider researchers range from the in-house researcher employed to conduct research to those who are conducting research in addition to their normal duties.  This thesis, through five illustrative case-studies, discusses, reflects upon, explains, and clarifies the possibilities, limitations and the issues arising from a consideration of the practice of professionals conducting research in the large government education system in Victoria.

The central focus of this thesis, that of exploring issues arising from professionals conducting research in their own working environments, has an importance that hitherto has had little direct recognition in the qualitative education research literature.  And yet the practice of insider research is common and has a potentially large impact on the nature of the decision making process in public sector organisations.  This relative invisibility in the social research literature of a discussion of issues relating to insider research demands to be made more visible.  It is both useful and necessary to explore the particular possibilities, conditions and challenges of insiders conducting research in public organisations as the practice of insider research contines to grow.  This thesis adds to the literature by locating insider research in a discussion of the wider soial context of ideology, culture, relationships, politics, language and meaning, and the decision-making process.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Insider research</field><field name="subject">process</field><field name="subject">practice</field><field name="subject">professionals</field><field name="subject">working environments</field><field name="subject">public sector</field><field name="subject">researcher</field><field name="subject">government education</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">ideology</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040614.122119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Within and Against Performativity:
Discursive Engagement in Adult Literacy and Basic Education</field><field name="creator">Sanguinetti, Jill</field><field name="description">The field of adult literacy and basic education (ALBE) has undergone dramatic changes in recent years with the advent of labour market programs, accreditation, competency-based assessment and competitive tendering for program funds. Teachers' working conditions have deteriorated and their professional autonomy has been eroded. ALBE has been increasingly instrumentalised to fulfil the requirements of a marketised economy and conform to its norms. The beliefs and value systems which traditionally underpinned the work of ALBE teachers have been reframed according to the principle of 'performativity' and the demands of the 'performative State' (Lyotard, 1984: 46, Yeatman 1994: 110).
The destabilisation of teachers' working lives can be understood as a manifestation of the 'postmodern condition' (Lyotard 1984; Harvey 1989): the collapse of the certainties and purposes of the past; the proliferation of technologies;  the impermanence and intensification of work;  the commodification of knowledge and curricula; and the dissolving of boundaries between disciplines and fields of knowledge. The critiques of the modernist grand narratives which underpin progressivist and critical approaches to adult literacy pedagogy have further undermined the traditional points of reference of ALBE teachers.
In this thesis I examine how teachers are teaching, surviving, resisting, and 'living the contradictions' (Seddon 1994) in the context of struggles to comply with and resist the requirements of performativity.  Following Foucault and a number of feminist poststructuralist authors, I have applied the notions of 'discursive engagement' and 'the politics of discourse' (Yeatman 1990a) as a way of theorising the interplay between imposed change and teachers' practice. I explore the discursive practices which take place at the interface between the 'new' policy discourses and older, naturalised discourses;  how teachers are engaged by and are engaging with discourses of performativity; how teachers are discursively constructing adult literacy pedagogy; what new, hybrid discourses of 'good practice' are emerging; and the micropractices of resistance which teachers are enacting in their speech and in their practice.
My purpose was to develop knowledge which would support the reflexivity of teachers; to enrich the theoretical languages that teachers could draw upon in trying to make sense of their situation; and to use those languages in speaking about the dilemmas of practice. I used participatory action research as a means of producing knowledge about teachers' practices, structured around their agency, and reflecting their standpoint (Harding 1993).
I describe two separate action research projects in which teachers of ALBE participated. I reflect on both projects in the light of poststructuralist theory and consider them as instances of what Lather calls 'within/against research' (Lather 1989: 27). I analyse written and spoken texts produced in both projects which reflect teachers' responses to competency-based assessment and other features of the changing context.
I use a method of discourse mapping to describe the discursive field and the teachers' discursive practices. Three main configurations of discourse are delineated: 'progressivism', 'professional teacher' and 'performativity'. The teachers mainly position themselves within a hybridising 'progressivist /professional teacher' discourse, as a discourse of resistance to 'performative' discourse. In adapting their pedagogies, the teachers are in some degree taking the language and world view of performativity into their own vocabularies and practices. The discursive picture I have mapped is complex and contradictory. On one hand, the 'progressivist /professional teacher' discourse appears to endure and to take strength from the articulation into it of elements of performative discourse, creating new possibilities for discursive transformation.  On the other hand, there are signs that performative discourse is colonising and subsuming progressivist /professional teacher discourse. At times, both of these tendencies are apparent in the one text.
Six micropractices of resistance are identified within the texts:  'rational critique', 'objectification', 'subversion', 'refusal', 'humour' and 'the affirmation of desire'. These reflect the teachers' agency in making discursive choices on the micro level of their every day practices.  Through those micropractices, the teachers are engaging with and resisting the micropractices and meanings of performativity.
I apply the same multi-layered method of analysis to an examination of discursive engagement in pedagogy by analysing a transcript of the teachers' discussion of critical incidents in their classrooms.  Their classroom pedagogies are revealed as complex, situated and eclectic. They are combining and integrating their 'embodied' and their 'institutional' powers, both 'seducing' (McWilliam 1995) and 'regulating' (Gore 1993) as they teach. A strong ethical project is apparent in the teachers' sense of social responsibility, in their determination to adhere to valued traditions of previous times, and in their critical self-awareness of the ways in which they use their institutional and embodied powers in the classroom.
Finally, l look back on the findings, and reflect on the possibilities of discursive engagement and the politics of discourse as a framework for more strategic practice in the current context. This research provides grounds for hope that, by becoming more self-conscious about how we engage discursively, we might become more strategic in our everyday professional practice.  Not withstanding the constraints (evident in this study) which limit the strategic potential of the politics of discourse, there is space for teachers to become more reflexive in their professional, pedagogical and political praxis. Development of more deliberate, self-reflexive praxis might lead to a 'postmodern democratic polities' (Yeatman 1994: 112) which would challenge the performative state and the system of globalised capital which it serves.

Short abstract
Adult literacy and basic education (ALBE) teachers have experienced a period of dramatic policy change in recent years; in particular, the introduction of competency-based assessment and competitive tendering for program funds. 'Discourse politics' provides a way of theorising the interplay between policy-mediated institutional change and teachers' practice. The focus of this study is 'discursive engagement'; how teachers are engaged by and are engaging with discourses of performativity. Through two action research projects, texts were generated of teachers talking and writing about how they were responding to the challenges, and developing their pedagogies in the new policy environment. These texts have been analysed and several patterns of discursive engagement delineated, named and illustrated. The strategic potential of 'discourse polities' is explored in the light of the findings.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult literacy and basic education (ALBE)</field><field name="subject">postmodern condition</field><field name="subject">Performativity</field><field name="subject">Discursive Engagement</field><field name="subject">competency-based assessment</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">research projects</field><field name="subject">self-reflexive praxis</field><field name="subject">classroom</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040615.103017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of an Australian Rural Music Festival</field><field name="creator">Garth, Alan</field><field name="description">A social and cultural study of the development of the Port Fairy Folk Festival within the context of the current revival of folk music in Australia.

The method of assessing the energy embodied in a product is known as energy analysis. Detailed office building embodied energy case studies are very rare. However, there is evidence to suggest that the energy requirements for the construction phase of commercial buildings, including the energy embodied in materials, is a significant component of the life cycle energy requirements.

This thesis sets out to examine the current state of energy analysis, determine the national average energy intensities &lt;
 i.e. embodied energy rates &lt;
for building materials and assess the significance of using national average energy intensities for the energy analysis of a case study office building. Likely ranges of variation in the building material embodied energy rates from the national averages are estimated and the resulting distribution for total embodied energy in the case study building simulated.

Strategies for improving the energy analysis methods and data are suggested. Detailed energy analysis is shown to be a useful indicative method of quantifying the energy required for the construction of buildings.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">buildings</field><field name="subject">national averages</field><field name="subject">data</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">manufacture</field><field name="subject">commercial buildings</field><field name="subject">office buildings</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040617.170806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A COMPARISON OF DEFECTS IN HOUSES CONSTRUCTED BY OWNERS AND REGISTERED BUILDERS IN VICTORIA 1988-1996</field><field name="creator">Georgiou, Jim</field><field name="description">The lack of attention to quality control by house builders in the Australian State of Victoria has been a contentious issue for more than two decades. Ina an attempt to improve the quality of housing, various mechanisms such as voluntary and compulsory registration schemes have been adopted and discarded by industry-based organisations and government. While builders are encouraged to improve construction quality, little is known and published about the quality of housing produced by owner builders specifically during the seven year warranty period after construction is completed. With this in mind, this thesis presents research findings that compare the latent defects in houses built by owner builders with those of registered builders. Using inspection reports provided by Archicentre &lt;a subsidiary of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects&gt; a sample of 1772 houses, of which 1002 were owner builders &lt;HO&gt; and 770 were registered builders &lt;HR&gt; was used to determine the severity, the incidence, and location of defects within each house type. Houses less than a year old were found to contain a siginificant proportion of defects for both types of builder. In addition, it was found that HO builders had a mean of 2.74 defects per house and HR builders mean of 2.30 defects per house for the seven-year warranty period. To determine whether there was a significant difference between the quality of housing produced by HO and HR the statistical technique of Chi-squared analysis was undertaken at a 5% level of significance. The analysis revealed that there was a significant difference between the quality of housing procured by owner &lt;HO&gt; and registered &lt;HR&gt; builders. In particular, it was found that the important category of workmanship for HO builders had significantly less defects that HR builders, which suggests that HR builders need to improve their managerial practices and the quality of on-site supervision. In essence, this thesis has provided a series of benchmark metrics for latent defects against which current and future legislative programs con be compared for new housing in the State of Victoria. It is recommended that future research focus on the methods for improving the role of the on-site supervisor as they are considered to be the important link in the quality chain.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">defects</field><field name="subject">Registered Builders</field><field name="subject">Owners Builders</field><field name="subject">Building Elements</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040618.094452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COMPUTING IN A SOCIAL CONTEXT: GENDER DIFFERENCES IN PARTICIPATION</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Valerie Ada</field><field name="description">The thesis reviews the literature relating to girls and computing within a framework which is structured around three specific questions. First, are there differences between girls and boys in their participation in class computing activities and/or in non-class computing activities? Second, do these differences in participation in computing activities have broader implications which justify the growing concern about the under-representation of girls? Third, wahy are girls under-represented in these activities?
Although the available literature is predominantly descriptive, the underlying implicit theoretical model is essentially a social learning model. Girl's differential participation is attributed to learned attitudes towards computing rathan to differences between girls and boys in general ability. These attitudes, which stress the masculine, mathematical, technological aspects of computing are developed through modelling, direct experience, intrinsic and extrinsic reinforcement and generalisation from pre-existing, attitudes to related curriculum areas. In the literature it is implicitly assumed that these attitudes underlie girl's decisions to self-select out of computing activities. In this thesis predictions from a social learning model are complemented by predictions derived from expectancy-value, cognitive dissonance and self-perception theories. These are tested in three separate studies.
Study one provides data from a pretest-posttest study of 24 children in a year four class learning BASIC. It examines pre- and posttest differences between girls and boys in computing experience, knowledge and achievement as well as the factors relating to computing achievement.
Study two uses a pretest-posttest control group design to study the gender differences in the impact of the introduction of Logo into years 1, 3, 5 and 7 in both a coeducational and single-sex setting using a sample of 222 children from three schools.
Study three utilises a larger sample of 1176 students, drawn from three secondary schools and five primary schools, enabling an evaluation of gender differences in relation to a wide range of class computing experiences and in a broader range of school contexts.
The overall results are consistent across the three studies, supporting the contention that social factors, rather than ability differences influence girls' participation and achievement in computing. The more global theoretical framework, drawing on social learning, expectancy-value, cognitive dissonance and self-perception theories, provides a more adequate explanation of gender differences in participation than does any one of these models.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computing</field><field name="subject">Social context</field><field name="subject">Gender differences</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">girls</field><field name="subject">under-represented</field><field name="subject">masculine</field><field name="subject">mathematical</field><field name="subject">technological aspects</field><field name="subject">single-sex</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040618.161440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL ON CONSOLIDATION</field><field name="creator">Carnegie, Garry D</field><field name="description">The issue of accounting for goodwill has caused considerable concern to accountants and academics. For over 100 years there has been diversity of views as to the nature, recognition and measurement of goodwill. Such diversity of views has contributed to the adoption of a variety of accounting practices for goodwill, which has lead to attempts to regulate practice by accounting professions in the Anglo-American world. The research conducted involves a literature review to identify the concepts and definition of goodwill and the criteria for its recognition and measurement. the investigation will then concentrate upon goodwill arising on consolidation of the financial statements of a group of companies. Major accounting practices will be examined, along with the requirements of the australian and mojor overseas professions on the issue. The findings of a study of listed Australian companies which investigated the accounting policies adopted for goodwill on consolidation before and after regulation of the issue and which sought views upon some of the conceptual issues involved are reported and discussed.

 is high in carbohydrates, high in fibre and low in fat. Dietary fibre reduces the rate of carbohydrate absorption, which may have a beneficial effect on insulin action. Furthermore, high fibre diets also increase the amount of carbohydrates which are not absorbed from the small intestine. These malabsorbed carbohydrates are fermented by the bacterial population in the large intestine, producing short chain fatty acids &amp;quoteSCFA&amp;quote, including propionate, which has been shown to alter liver carbohydrate metabolism. This thesis investigated the actions of slowed carbohydrate absorption and carbohydrate malabsorption in streptozotocin-induced &amp;quoteSTZ&amp;quote diabetic rats.
High carbohydrate diet supplemented with guar gum, a soluble dietary fibre, fed to STZ diabetic rats improved insulin sensitivity. investigation of the alterations in the stomach and small intestine demonstrated that guar increased the viscosity of the meal in the intestine. The action of increased fermentation, producing more propionate, was investigated by supplementing propionate into the diets of STZ diabetic rats or when perfused into isolated rat livers. No changes in insulin action or liver glucose metabolism were measured. in addition, it was shown that guar gum reduces food intake in STZ diabetic rats. Mild reductions in food intake in STZ diabetic rats were shown to increase insulin action.
In summary, STZ diabetic rats fed high carbohydrate, high fibre diets reductions in food consumption and slowed carbohydrate absorption are important factors which may lower blood glucose concentrations and increase insulin action. increased SCFA production is unlikely to contribute significantly to the improvements in insulin action.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dietary fibre</field><field name="subject">Carbohydrate</field><field name="subject">Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Rat</field><field name="subject">Diet</field><field name="subject">Treatment</field><field name="subject">Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)</field><field name="subject">Carbohydrates</field><field name="subject">Guar gum</field><field name="subject">STZ diabetic rats</field><field name="subject">Fermentation</field><field name="subject">supplements</field><field name="subject">Propionate</field><field name="subject">Insulin</field><field name="subject">Viscosity</field><field name="subject">Blood glucose</field><field name="subject">SCFA</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040622.171657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Perceptions of the Orient 1880-1910</field><field name="creator">Cummins, Rodney John Travers</field><field name="description">Abstract not supplied.

Many health promoters continue to exert power-over the community through top-down programming whilst at the same time using an emancipatory discourse. The thesis has addressed this contradiction in three parts. The first part determines how the emancipatroty discourse has evolved and eplores the role of social movements in the development of contemporary health discourses and their influence on the legitimisation of empowerment. Central to this discourse is the empowerment of communities. To understand the role of this concept the thesis provides an interpretation of the different meanings of power and community, and the different levels of analysis of empowerment in the context of health promotion programming.
The second part identifies the nature of health programming and the dominance of top-down, and to a much lesser extent, bottom-up approaches. The thesis argues that these two approaches are not, and do not have to be, mutually exclusive. To address this issue the thesis presents a new methodology is situated within a framework developed for the accomodation of empowerment goals within health promotion programmes. The study also identifies the organisational areas of influence on the processs of community empowerment and it is these which are used for the assessment of this concept. Both the framework and the methodology address the contradiction in health promotion by making community empowerment operational within a programme context.
The third part of the thesis supports the rationale for the design of the methodology with field work in rural Fijian communities. The findings are presented as a composite case study to highlight the experiences of implementing the methodolgy and the main themes that emerged during the field work. the final chapter of the thesis brings together the central themes of the study and draws from these and 'emergent agenda' as a way forward for health promotion research and practice.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">contradiction between discourse and practice in health promotion</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">emancipatory discourse</field><field name="subject">social movements</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="subject">top-down and bottom-up approaches</field><field name="subject">rural communities</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040723.104140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN ONGOING COLONIAL LEGACY: CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION BELIEFS AND PRACTICES IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA</field><field name="creator">Young, Kathryn</field><field name="description">In the late 1980&#161;&#166;s, a realisation that the western education system bequeathed to Papua New Guinea at the time of Independence had functioned to devalue and marginalise many of the traditional beliefs, knowledge and skills students brought with them to education, led to a period of significant education reform. The Reform was premised on the report of a Ministerial Review Committee called A Philosophy of Education. This report made recommendations about how education in Papua New Guinea could respond to the issues and challenges this nation faced as it sought to chart a course to serve the needs of its citizens on its own terms.

The issues associated with managing and implementing institutionalised educational change premised on importing western values and practices are a central theme of this thesis. The impact of importing foreign curriculum and associated curriculum officers and consultants to assist with curriculum change and development in the former Language and Literacy unit of the Curriculum Development Division, is considered in three related sections of this report:

&#132;P	a critical review of the imported educational system and related practices
      and related issues since Independence
&#132;P	narrative report of the experience of two colleagues in western education
&#132;P	evidential research based on curriculum Reform in the Language and
      Literacy Unit.

How Papua New Guinea has sought to come to terms with the issues and challenges that arose in response to a practice of importing western curriculum both at the time of Independence and currently through the Reform, are explored throughout the thesis. The findings issues reveal much about the capacity of individuals and institutions to respond to a post-colonial world particularly associated with an ongoing colonial legacy in the principle researcher&#161;&#166;s work context.

The thesis argues that the challenges Papua New Guinea curriculum officers face today, as they manage and implement changes associated with another imported curriculum are caught up in existing power relations. These power relations function to stifle creative thinking at a time when it is most needed. Further, these power relations are not well understood by the curriculum officers and remained hidden and unquestioned throughout the research project.

The thesis also argues that in the researcher&#161;&#166;s work context, techniques of surveillance were brought to bear and functioned to curtail critical thinking about how the reformed curriculum could be sensitive and respectful of those beliefs and traditions that had sustained life in Papua New Guinea for thousands of years. Consequently, many outmoded beliefs and practices associated with an uncritical and ongoing acceptance of the superiority of western imports have been retained, thereby effectively denying the collective voices of Paua New Guineans in the current curriculum Reform.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colonial legacy</field><field name="subject">western education system</field><field name="subject">independence</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">western values</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">language and literacy</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040726.102645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Internationalisation of Singapore Television: Singaporean Regional and Global Perspectives and Contexts</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Marianne</field><field name="description">In this study l investigate the Singaporean characteristics of broadcast media internationalisation.

In Australia many studies in health behaviour research do not include women whose first language is not English. 

The third aim was to evaluate the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria&#146;s (ACCV) Community Language Program (CLP) by: (a) identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the program as seen by the participants; and (b) assessing the impact of the program on women&#146;s knowledge and beliefs about breast cancer, early detection of breast cancer, self-reported and intended breast screening behaviours. The CLP is an information service that uses women&#146;s first language to convey information to women whose first language is not English. The CLP was designed to increase knowledge about breast and cervical cancer.

The research used a pre-test-intervention-post-test design with 174 Italian-born and 138 Anglo-Australian women aged 40 years and over. Interviews for the Italian sample were conducted in Italian. The intervention was an information session that related to breast health and screening mammography. Demographic variables were collected in the Pre-Test only. Qualitative open-ended questions that related specifically to the information session were collected in the Post-Test phase of the study. Direct logistic regression was used with the participants&#146; beliefs and behaviours to identify the relevant variables for language (Italian speaking and English-speaking), attendance to an information session, mammography screening and breast self-examination (BSE) behaviour. Pre- and Post-Test comparisons were conducted using chi-square tests for the non-parametric data and paired sample t-tests for the parametric data.

Differences were found between the Italian and Anglo-Australian women in relation to their beliefs about breast cancer screening. The Italian women were: (1) more likely to state that medical experts understood the causes of breast cancer; (2) more likely to feel that they had less control over their personal risk of getting breast cancer; (3) more likely to be upset and frightened by thinking about breast cancer; (4) less likely to perceive breast cancer as serious; (4) more likely to only do what their doctor told them to do; and (5) less likely to agree that there were times when a person has cancer and they don&#146;t know it. 

A pattern emerged for the Italian and Anglo-Australian women from the logistic regression analyses. The Italian women were much more likely to comply with medical authority and advice. The Anglo-Australian women were more likely to feel that they had some control over their health. Specifically, the risk variable &#145;dread&#146; was more applicable to the Italian women&#146;s behaviour and internal locus of control variable was more relevant to the Anglo-Australian women. The qualitative responses also differed for the two samples. The Italian women&#146;s comments were more general, less specific, and more limited than that of the Anglo-Australian women. The Italian women talked about learning how to do BSE whereas the Anglo-Australian women said that attending the session had reminded them to do BSE more regularly.  

The key findings and contributions of the present research were numerous. The focus on one cultural group ensured comprehensive analyses, as did the inclusion of an adequate sample size to enable the use of multivariate statistics. Separating the Italian and Anglo-Australian samples in the analyses provided theoretical implications that would have been overlooked if the two groups were combined. The use of both qualitative and quantitative data capitalised on the strengths of both techniques. The inclusion of an Anglo-Australian group highlighted key theoretical findings, differences between the two groups and unique contributions made by both samples during the collection of the qualitative data. The use of a pre-test-intervention-post-test design emphasised the reticence of the Italian sample to participate and talk about breast cancer and confirmed and validated the consistency of the responses across the two interviews for both samples. The inclusion of non-cued responses allowed the researcher to identify the key salient issues relevant to the two groups. The limitations of the present research were the lack of many women who were not screening and reliance on self-report responses, although few differences were observed between the Pre- and Post-Test comparisons. 

The theoretical contribution of the HBM and the TRA variables was minimal in relation to screening mammography or attendance at the CLP. The applicability of these health behaviour theories may be less relevant for women today as they clearly knew the benefits of and the seriousness of breast cancer screening. The present research identified the applicability of the risk variables to the Italian women and the relevance of the locus of control variables to the Anglo-Australian women. Thus, clear cultural differences occurred between the two groups. 

The inclusion of the illness representations was advantageous as the responses highlighted ideas and personal theories salient to the women not identified by the HBM. The use of the illness representations and the qualitative responses further confirmed the relevance of the risk variables to the Italian women and the locus of control variables to the Anglo-Australian women.

Attendance at the CLP did not influence the women to attend for mammography screening. Behavioural changes did not occur between the Pre- and Post-Test interviews. Small incremental changes as defined by the TTM and the stages of change may have occurred. Key practical implications for the CLP were identified. Improving the recruitment methods to gain a higher proportion of women who do not screen is imperative for the CLP promoters. The majority of the Italian and Anglo-Australian women who attended the information sessions were women who screen. The fact that Italian women do not like talking or thinking about cancer presents a challenge to promoters of the CLP. The key theoretical finding that Italian women dread breast cancer but comply with their doctor provides clear strategies to improve attendance at mammography screening. In addition, the inclusion of lay health advisors may be one way of increasing attendance to the CLP by including Italian women already attending screening and likely to have attended a CLP session. 

The present research identified the key finding that improving Anglo-Australian attendance at an information session is related to debunking the myth surrounding familial risk of breast cancer and encouraging the Anglo-Australian women to take more control of their health. Improving attendance for Italian women is related to reducing the fear and dread of breast cancer and building on the compliance pattern with medical authority. Therefore, providing an information session in the target language is insufficient to attract non-screeners to the session and then to screen for breast cancer.

Suggestions for future research in relation to screening mammography were to include variables from more than one theory or model, namely the risk, locus of control and illness representations. The inclusion of non-cued responses to identify salient beliefs is advantageous. In addition, it is imperative to describe the profile of the cultural sample in detail, include detailed descriptions of the translation process and be aware of the tendency of Italian women to acquiesce with medical authority.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Screening Mammography</field><field name="subject">Italian and Anglo-Australian Women</field><field name="subject">breast cancer</field><field name="subject">cervical cancer</field><field name="subject">Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria&#146;s (ACCV) Community Language Program (CLP)</field><field name="subject">English-speaking persons</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040825.105605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Modified Life Cycle Inventory of 
Aluminium Die Casting</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Michael John</field><field name="description">Aluminium die casting is a process used to transform molten aluminium material into automotive gearbox housings, wheels and electronic components, among many other uses. It is used because it is a very efficient method of achieving near net shape with the required mechanical properties. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a technique used to determine the environmental impacts of a product or process. The Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) is the initial phase of an LCA and describes which emissions will occur and which raw materials are used during the life of a product or during a process. This study has improved the LCI technique by adding in manufacturing and other costs to the ISO standardised methods. Although this is not new, the novel application and allocation methods have been developed independently. The improved technique has then been applied to Aluminium High Pressure Die Casting. In applying the improved LCI to this process, the cost in monetary terms and environmental emissions have been determined for a particular component manufactured by this process. A model has been developed in association with an industry partner so this technique can be repeatedly applied and used in the prediction of costs and emissions. This has been tested with two different products. Following this, specialised LCA software modelling of the aluminium high pressure die casting process was conducted. The variations in the process have shown that each particular component will have different costs and emissions and it is not possible to generalise the process by modelling only one component. This study has concentrated on one process within die casting but the techniques developed can be used across any variations in the die casting process.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminium die casting</field><field name="subject">ISO standardised methods</field><field name="subject">Life Cycle Inventory (LCI)</field><field name="subject">molten aluminium material</field><field name="subject">Aluminium High Pressure Die Casting</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040825.110759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BODY DISSATISFACTION AND BODY CHANGE STRATEGIES AMONG ADOLESCENTS: A LONGITUDINAL INVESTIGATION</field><field name="creator">Vincent, Maureen Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis examined body dissatisfaction and body change behaviors among adolescent girls and boys from a biopsychosocial framework. The contribution of biological, psychological and sociocultural factors were examined in relation to body dissatisfaction, weight loss, weight gain and increased muscle tone behaviors among early adolescent girls and boys. In particular, pubertal maturation, body mass index (BMI), perception of body shape and size and psychological factors, such as depression, anxiety, ineffectiveness, self-esteem and perfectionism, were examined as possible factors that may precipitate or maintain body dissatisfaction and engagement in body change strategies. The sociocultural factors evaluated were the quality of family and peer relationships, as well as the influence of family and peers in predicting the adoption of specific body change strategies. The specific mechanisms by which these influences were transmitted were also examined. These included perceived discussion, encouragement and modelling of various body change strategies, as well as perceived teasing about body shape and size.
A number of separate cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were conducted to examine the above relationships and identify the factors that contribute to weight loss, weight gain and increased muscle tone behaviors in adolescents. Study 1 examined the psychometric properties and principal components structure of the Bulimia Test Revised (BULIT-R; Thelen, Farmer, Wonderlich, &amp; Smith, 1991) to assess its applicability to adolescent samples. Study 2 investigated the nature of body dissatisfaction and weight loss
 
behaviors among 603 adolescents (306 girls and 297 boys) using a standardised questionnaire. This preliminary study was conducted to ascertain whether variables previously found to be relevant to adolescent girls, could also be related to the development of body dissatisfaction and weight loss behaviors among adolescent boys.
Studies 3 and 4 described the development and validation of a body modification scale that measured weight loss, weight gain and increased muscle tone behaviors. Studies 5 and 6 were designed to modify an Excessive Exercise Scale developed by Long, Smith, Midgley, and Cassidy (1993) into a shorter form, and validate this scale with an adolescent sample. Study 7 investigated the factors that contribute to weight loss, weight gain and increased muscle among adolescent girls and boys both cross-sectionally and longitudinally (over one year). Structural equation modelling was used to examine associations among self-reported body dissatisfaction, body change strategies and a range of biological, psychological and sociocultural variables both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
Overall, the results suggested that both girls and boys experience body dissatisfaction and engage in a number of different body change strategies in order to achieve an ideal size. A number of gender similarities and differences were identified in the expression of body dissatisfaction and the adoption of body change strategies for both girls and boys. Girls were more likely than boys to report body dissatisfaction and engage in weight loss behaviors, while boys were more likely than girls to engage in weight gain and increased muscle tone behaviors. Generally, the same factors were found to contribute to weight
 
loss, and more specifically, bulimic symptomatology, ad weight gain in both adolescent girls and boys. While a combination of biological, psychological and sociocultural factors contributed to bulimic symptomatology, only biological and psychological factors were found to contribute to weight gain in adolescents. The most notable gender differences were found in the model of increased muscle tone. Sociocultural and biological factors contributed to increased muscle tone behaviors in girls, while sociocultural and psychological factors were implicated in these behaviors in adolescent boys. With the exception of the model of increased muscle tone for boys, body dissatisfaction was a consistent factor in the adoption of body change behaviors. Consistent with previous investigations, the present thesis provides empirical support for the need to examine the etiology and maintenance of such concerns and behaviors from a multifaceted perspective.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Body dissatisfaction</field><field name="subject">body change</field><field name="subject">adolescent girls and boys</field><field name="subject">biopsychosocial framework</field><field name="subject">biological</field><field name="subject">psychological</field><field name="subject">sociocultural factors</field><field name="subject">muscle tone behaviors</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="subject">perfectionism</field><field name="subject">pubertal maturation</field><field name="subject">body mass index (BMI)</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">anxiety</field><field name="subject">Bulimia Test Revised (BULIT-R; Thelen</field><field name="subject">Farmer</field><field name="subject">Wonderlich</field><field name="subject">&amp; Smith</field><field name="subject">1991)</field><field name="subject">gender similarities</field><field name="subject">weight loss</field><field name="subject">muscle tone behaiours</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040906.135500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL AUDITING IN THE VICTORIAN PUBLIC SERVICE (1982-1987)</field><field name="creator">O'Kane, Stephen</field><field name="description">The selection of an inappropriate regime by policy makers can thwart the effective implementation of public policy and lead to implementation failure. Competing values in the implementation process have a significant impact on the results of implementation, and the regime selected for implementation implies the choice of one value over another. Stoker has argued that on the one hand central leadership is valued for consistency, benefits of scale, co-ordination and cost sharing (instrumental model); and on the other, diffuse authority is valued as knowledge is particular and situational, and the task of analysis is to understand the problems, perspectives and interactions of implementation participants at the contact point between public programs and their clients (accommodation model). This study examines the implementation regime chosen by the Victorian Government for the introduction of a modern internal auditing function into the Victorian Public Service, using the Bureau of Internal Audit within its Department of Management and Budget. The selection of the Department of Management and Budget for the introduction of Internal Audit as a managerial accountability mechanism indicates that the instrumental model was held by the Victorian Government to be the most important in implementation. It is argued that use of a top-down central agency leadership approach resulted in implementation failure. Three propositions suggesting the mechanisms by which this result is brought about are examined: that lack of co-ordinated planning at the outset will result in inadequate definition of client needs as part of policy formulation; that intraorganisational conflict during the implementation success, as individual participants are likely to exercise their veto; and the increasing the number of participants contributes to complexity, so that they should only be involved in implementation when their presence is absolutely required.

It is argued that the essential task of implementation is to create an environment where participants are likely to co-operate to achieve predetermined public policy goals; and that the introduction of a modern internal auditing approach into the Victorian Public Service required a more participatory implementation regime in order to facilitate policy outcomes and prevent implementation failure. It is also argued that the dominance of economic reform over accountability in Victoria restricted the ability of the Bureau of Internal Audit to implement change to internal audit practices within Victorian Government departments.

The selection of an instrumental model of implementation by the Department of Management and Budget is examined in the context of the environment that existed in Victoria between 1982-1987; and while some of the values which Stoker associates with the top-down approach to policy making were observed, an alternative view to the development of internal auditing in the Victorian Public Service can be sustained.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">policy makers</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">cost sharing</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">consistency</field><field name="subject">benefits of scale</field><field name="subject">co-ordination</field><field name="subject">Victorian Government</field><field name="subject">Victorian Public Service</field><field name="subject">Department of Management and Budget</field><field name="subject">Internal audit</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040906.151857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE MACROECONOMIC IMPACT OF FOREIGN AID TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Akhter</field><field name="description">The thesis looks at the macroeconomic impact of foreign aid. It is specially concerned with aid's impact on the public sector of less developed countries &lt; LDCs&gt; . Since the overwhelming majority of aid is directed to the public sector of LDCs, one can only understand the broader macroeconomic impact of aid if one first understands its impact on this sector. To this end, the thesis econometrically estimates " fiscal response"  models of aid. These models, in essence, attempt to shed light on public sector fiscal behaviour in the presence of aid inflows, being specially concerned with the way aid is used to finance various categories of expenditures. The underlaying concern is to extent to which aid is " fungible" -that is, whether it finances consumption expenditure and reductions in taxation revenue in LDCs. A number of alternative models are derived from a utility maximisation framework. These alternatives reflect different assumptions regarding the behaviour of LDC public sectors and relate to the endogeniety &lt;as opposed to exogeniety&gt; of aid, whether or not recurrent expenditure is financed from domestic borrowing and the determination of domestic borrowing. The original frameworks of earlier studies are extended in a number of ways, including the use of a public sector utility function which is fully consistent with expected maximising behaviour. Estimates of these models' parameters are obtained using both time-series and cross-section data, dating from the 1960s, for Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and the Philippines. Both structural and reduced-form equations are 
estimated. Results suggest that foreign aid &lt;defined as all foreign inflows to 
the official sector&gt; is indeed fungible, albeit at different levels. Moreover, the
overall impact of aid &lt;both loans and grants&gt; on public sector investment, consumption, domestic borrowing and taxation varies between countries. Generally speaking, aid leads to increases in investment and consumption expenditure, but reduces taxation and domestic borrowing. Comparative analysis does, however, show that these results are highly sensitive to alternative behavioural assumptions and, therefore, model specification.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macroeconomic</field><field name="subject">public sector of LDCs</field><field name="subject">fiscal response</field><field name="subject">1960s</field><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">Pakistan</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">expenditure</field><field name="subject">domestic borrowing</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20040907.174003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CRISIS IN CLIO'S FAMILY: A STUDY OF THE DISCIPLINE OF AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC HISTORY 1918-1965
Part One &amp; Two</field><field name="creator">Haig-Muir, Kathleen Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an intellectual history of the historiography of Australian Economic History between 1918 and 1965.  More specifically, it is a contribution to a relatively novel area of research into 'disciplinary history&#146;.   It takes as its basic analytical material the four books widely used for significant lengths of time for undergraduate teaching during the period of the study.
The thesis consists of five main chapters, plus an appendix which surveys the  institutional development of Australian  Economic History and provides the empirical basis for the selection of the works named above.  After a brief introduction and overview, the next four chapters consist of a detailed study of one of these works, the historical context in which each was written, and an intellectual biography.
The fifth chapter is largely theoretical and conceptual.  It analyses the epistemological bases of History and Economics and explores the implications of different models of knowledge for the relationship between Economic History and its two antecedent disciplines, History and Economics. Current perceptions of the state of the discipline in Australia and overseas are also examined.
There are three main propositions advanced and their implications explored in the fifth chapter.  First, that changes which occurred in Australian Economic  History during the  period  1918-1965 shifted the discipline from the broad area of History to the broad area of Economics. Second, that the inherent tension and fundamental differences between the two disciplinary areas of History and Economics have profound and complex implications for Australian Economic History at a number of levels and in a number of areas.
The third proposition posits that the paradigm shift of the 1950s/1960s in Australian  Economic History, and the paradigm shift of the 1960s/1970s in  Economic History respectively have resulted in crisis.    The final part of the chapter summarises the contents of the preceding chapters, and draws some conclusions based on those detailed   studies.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian  Economic History</field><field name="subject">historiography of Australian Economic History</field><field name="subject">epistemological bases of History and Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20041208.151237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE DIFFUSION
OF INNOVATION IN TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION: IMPLEMENTING E-MAIL THROUGH ACTION RESEARCH</field><field name="creator">Ferrier, J. D.</field><field name="description">This research project examined the diffusion of change within one Victorian TAPE Institute by engaging action research to facilitate implementation of e-mail technology. The theoretical framework involving the concepts of technology innovation and action research was enhanced with the aid of Rogers's (1983) model of the diffusion of the innovation process. Political and cultural factors made up the initiation phase of innovation, enabling the research to concentrate on the implementation phase of e-mail Roger's (1983) model also provided adopter categories that related to the findings of a Computer Attitude Survey that was conducted at The School of Mines and Industries Ballarat (SMB), now the University of Ballarat&#151;TAPE Division since amalgamation on 1st January 1998.
Despite management rhetoric about the need to utilise e-mail, Institute teaching staff lacked individual computers in their work areas and most were waiting to become connected to the Internet as late as 1997. According to the action research reports, many staff were resistant to the new e-mail facilities despite having access to personal computers whose numbers doubled annually. The action research project became focussed when action researchers realised that e-mail workshop training was ineffective and that staff required improved access. Improvement to processes within education through collaborative action research had earlier been achieved (McTaggart 1994), and this project actively engaged practitioners to facilitate decentralised e-mail training in the workplace through the action research spiral of planning, acting, observing and reflecting, before replanning. The action researchers * task was to find ways to improve the diffusion of e-mail throughout the Institute and to develop theoretical constructs. My research task was to determine whether action research could successfully facilitate e-mail throughout the Institute.
A rich literature existed about technology use in education, technology teaching, gender issues, less about computerphobia, and none about 'e-mailphobia \ It seemed appropriate to pursue the issue of e-mailphobia since it was marginalised, or ignored in the literature. The major political and cultural influences on the technologising of SMB and e-mail introduction were complex, making it impossible to ascertain the relative degrees of influence held by Federal and State Governments, SMB's leadership or the local community, Nonetheless, with the implementation of e-mail, traditional ways were challenged as SMB's culture changed. E-mail training was identified as a staff professional development activity that had been largely unsuccessful.
Action research is critical collaborative inquiry by reflective practitioners who are accountable for making the results of their inquiry public and who are self-evaluating of their practice while engaging participative problem-solving and continuing professional development (Zuber-Skerritt 1992, 1993). Action research was the methodology employed in researching e-mail implementation into SMB because it involved collaborative inquiry with colleagues as reflective practitioners. Thoughtful questions could best be explored using deconstructivist philosophy, in asking about the noise of silence, which issues were not addressed, what were the contradictions and who was being marginalised with e-mail usage within SMB. Reviewing literature on action research was complicated by its broad definition and by the variability of research (King &amp; Lonnquist 1992), and yet action research as a research methodology was well represented in educational research literature, and provided a systematic and recognisable way for practitioners to conduct their research.
On the basis of this study, it could be stated that action research facilitated the diffusion of e-mail technology into one TAPE Institute, despite the process being disappointingly slow. While the process in establishing the action research group was problematic, action researchers showed that a window of opportunity existed for decentralised diffusion of e-mail training,in preference to bureaucratically motivated 'workshops. Eight major findings, grouped under two broad headings were identified: the process of diffusion (planning, nature of the process, culture, politics) and outcomes of diffusion (categorising, e-mailphobia, the survey device and technology in education).
The findings indicated that staff had little experience with e-mail and appeared not to recognise its benefits. While 54.1% did not agree that electronic means could be the preferred way to receive Institute memost some 13.7% admitted to problems with using the voice answering service on telephones. Some 43.3% thought e-mail would not improve their connectedness (how they related) to the Institute. A small percentage of staff had trouble with telephone voice-mail and a number of these were anxious computer users.
Individualised tuition and peer support proved helpful to individual staff whom action researchers believed to be 'at risk', as determined from the results of a Computer Attitude Survey. An instructional strategy that fostered the development of self-regulation and peer support was valuable, but there was no measure of the effects of this action research program, other than in qualitative terms. Nevertheless, action research gave space to reflect on the nature of the underlying processes in adopting e-mail.
Challenges faced by TAPE action researchers are integrally affected by the values within TAPE, which change constantly and have recently been extensive enough to be considered as a 'new paradigm'. The influence of competition policy, the training reform agenda and technologisation of training have challenged traditional TAPE values. Action research reported that many staff had little immediate professional reason to use e-mail Theoretical  answers   were  submerged   beneath practical professional concerns, which related back to how much time teachers had and whether they could benefit from e-mail. A need for the development of principles for
 
the sound educational uses of e-mail increases with the internationalisation of education and an increasing awareness of cultural differences.
The implications for conducting action research in TAPE are addressed under the two broad issues of power and pedagogy. Issues of power included gaining access, management's inability to overcome staff resistance to technology, changing TAPE values and using technology for conducting action research. Pedagogical issues included the recognition of educational above technological issues and training staff in action research. Finally, seventeen steps are suggested to overcome power and pedagogical impediments to the conduct of action research within TAPE. This action research project has provided greater insight into the difficulties of successfully introducing one culture-specific technology into one TAPE Institute. TAPE Institutes need to encourage more action research into their operations, and it is only then that -we can expect to answer the unanswered questions raised in this research project.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Victorian TAPE Institute</field><field name="subject">e-mail technology</field><field name="subject">School of Mines and Industries Ballarat (SMB)</field><field name="subject">Computer Attitude Survey</field><field name="subject">Political and cultural</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20041208.155904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DISTANCE, DIALOGUE AND DIFFERENCE
A Postpositivist Approach to
Understanding Distance Education
in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Guy, Richard</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the experiences of a group of educators engaged in a professional development program by distance education in Papua New Guinea.
The participants in this study have been keeping professional journals, for periods of up to three years, about their experiences of distance education. Their discourses have been used to form a &#145;connected group&#146; of research participants, who use an action framework to focus on problematic issues surrounding distance education in Papua New Guinea.
It is a piece of research, framed by critical theory, and characterised by participation, collaboration, reflexivity, reciprocity and empowerment. The process of the study is based in dialogue, and takes the view that research is constituted of a transformative perspective, which alters the way research participants understand the multiple realities in which they live and work, arid ultimately results in improvements in their lived experiences. The nature of the methodology privileges Voice' and a discourse of difference from each participant which contributes to the problematic nature of the study. The study has concerned itself, increasingly, with issues of power and control in the research process, and this has resulted in significant changes in the research as participants have become more conscious of issues such as distance, dialogue and difference.
The study has evolved over a period of time in significant ways, and evidence is available that teachers in Papua New Guinea, despite structural and pedagogical barriers, are critically reflective and are able to transform their practice in ways which are consistent with social, cultural and political contexts in which they live and work. A number of 'local1 theories about research and distance education in Papua New Guinea are developed by the participants as they become informed about issues during the research. The practice of distance education and professional development, at personal and institutional levels, undergoes reconstruction during the life of the research and the study 'signals' other ways in which distance education and professional development may be reconstructed in Papua New Guinea.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Postpositivist</field><field name="subject">Understanding</field><field name="subject">Distance Education</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">cultural</field><field name="subject">political</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">study signals</field><field name="subject">power and control in the research process</field><field name="subject">methodology privileges Voice</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20041209.093035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Comprehensive Embodied Energy Analysis Framework</field><field name="creator">Treloar, Graham John</field><field name="description">The assessment of the direct and indirect requirements for energy is known as embodied energy analysis. For buildings, the direct energy includes that used primarily on site, while the indirect energy includes primarily the energy required for the manufacture of building materials. This thesis is concerned with the completeness and reliability of embodied energy analysis methods. Previous methods tend to address either one of these issues, but not both at the same time. Industry-based methods are incomplete. National statistical methods, while comprehensive, are a &#145;black box&#146; and are subject to errors. A new hybrid embodied energy analysis method is derived to optimise the benefits of previous methods while minimising their flaws. 
In industry-based studies, known as &#145;process analyses&#146;, the energy embodied in a product is traced laboriously upstream by examining the inputs to each preceding process towards raw materials. Process analyses can be significantly incomplete, due to increasing complexity. The other major embodied energy analysis method, &#145;input-output analysis&#146;, comprises the use of national statistics. While the input-output framework is comprehensive, many inherent assumptions make the results unreliable. 
Hybrid analysis methods involve the combination of the two major embodied energy analysis methods discussed above, either based on process analysis or input-output analysis. The intention in both hybrid analysis methods is to reduce errors associated with the two major methods on which they are based. However, the problems inherent to each of the original methods tend to remain, to some degree, in the associated hybrid versions. 
Process-based hybrid analyses tend to be incomplete, due to the exclusions associated with the process analysis framework. However, input-output-based hybrid analyses tend to be unreliable because the substitution of process analysis data into the input-output framework causes unwanted indirect effects. 
A key deficiency in previous input-output-based hybrid analysis methods is that the input-output model is a &#145;black box&#146;, since important flows of goods and services with respect to the embodied energy of a sector cannot be readily identified. A new input-output-based hybrid analysis method was therefore developed, requiring the decomposition of the input-output model into mutually exclusive components (ie, &#145;direct energy paths&#146;). 
A direct energy path represents a discrete energy requirement, possibly occurring one or more transactions upstream from the process under consideration. For example, the energy required directly to manufacture the steel used in the construction of a building would represent a direct energy path of one non-energy transaction in length. A direct energy path comprises a &#145;product quantity&#146; (for example, the total tonnes of cement used) and a &#145;direct energy intensity&#146; (for example, the energy required directly for cement manufacture, per tonne). 
The input-output model was decomposed into direct energy paths for the &#145;residential building construction&#146; sector. It was shown that 592 direct energy paths were required to describe 90% of the overall total energy intensity for &#145;residential building construction&#146;. By extracting direct energy paths using yet smaller threshold values, they were shown to be mutually exclusive. Consequently, the modification of direct energy paths using process analysis data does not cause unwanted indirect effects.
A non-standard individual residential building was then selected to demonstrate the benefits of the new input-output-based hybrid analysis method in cases where the products of a sector may not be similar. Particular direct energy paths were modified with case specific process analysis data. Product quantities and direct energy intensities were derived and used to modify some of the direct energy paths. The intention of this demonstration was to determine whether 90% of the total embodied energy calculated for the building could comprise the process analysis data normally collected for the building. However, it was found that only 51% of the total comprised normally collected process analysis. The integration of process analysis data with 90% of the direct energy paths by value was unsuccessful because: 
&#149;	typically only one of the direct energy path components was modified using process analysis data (ie, either the product quantity or the direct energy intensity);
&#149;	of the complexity of the paths derived for &#145;residential building construction&#146;; and
&#149;	of the lack of reliable and consistent process analysis data from industry, for both product quantities and direct energy intensities.
While the input-output model used was the best available for Australia, many errors were likely to be carried through to the direct energy paths for &#145;residential building construction&#146;. Consequently, both the value and relative importance of the direct energy paths for &#145;residential building construction&#146; were generally found to be a poor model for the demonstration building. This was expected. Nevertheless, in the absence of better data from industry, the input-output data is likely to remain the most appropriate for completing the framework of embodied energy analyses of many types of products&#151;even in non-standard cases. 
&#145;Residential building construction&#146; was one of the 22 most complex Australian economic sectors (ie, comprising those requiring between 592 and 3215 direct energy paths to describe 90% of their total energy intensities). Consequently, for the other 87 non-energy sectors of the Australian economy, the input-output-based hybrid analysis method is likely to produce more reliable results than those calculated for the demonstration building using the direct energy paths for &#145;residential building construction&#146;. 
For more complex sectors than &#145;residential building construction&#146;, the new input-output-based hybrid analysis method derived here allows available process analysis data to be integrated with the input-output data in a comprehensive framework. The proportion of the result comprising the more reliable process analysis data can be calculated and used as a measure of the reliability of the result for that product or part of the product being analysed (for example, a building material or component).
To ensure that future applications of the new input-output-based hybrid analysis method produce reliable results, new sources of process analysis data are required, including for such processes as services (for example, &#145;banking&#146;) and processes involving the transformation of basic materials into complex products (for example, steel and copper into an electric motor). 
However, even considering the limitations of the demonstration described above, the new input-output-based hybrid analysis method developed achieved the aim of the thesis: to develop a new embodied energy analysis method that allows reliable process analysis data to be integrated into the comprehensive, yet unreliable, input-output framework.

Plain language summary
Embodied energy analysis comprises the assessment of the direct and indirect energy requirements associated with a process. For example, the construction of a building requires the manufacture of steel structural members, and thus indirectly requires the energy used directly and indirectly in their manufacture. Embodied energy is an important measure of ecological sustainability because energy is used in virtually every human activity and many of these activities are interrelated. 
This thesis is concerned with the relationship between the completeness of embodied energy analysis methods and their reliability. However, previous industry-based methods, while reliable, are incomplete. Previous national statistical methods, while comprehensive, are a &#145;black box&#146; subject to errors. 
A new method is derived, involving the decomposition of the comprehensive national statistical model into components that can be modified discretely using the more reliable industry data, and is demonstrated for an individual building. The demonstration failed to integrate enough industry data into the national statistical model, due to the unexpected complexity of the national statistical data and the lack of available industry data regarding energy and non-energy product requirements. 
These unique findings highlight the flaws in previous methods. Reliable process analysis and input-output data are required, particularly for those processes that were unable to be examined in the demonstration of the new embodied energy analysis method. This includes the energy requirements of services sectors, such as banking, and processes involving the transformation of basic materials into complex products, such as refrigerators. The application of the new method to less complex products, such as individual building materials or components, is likely to be more successful than to the residential building demonstration.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comprehensive Embodied Energy Analysis Framework</field><field name="subject">industry-based studies</field><field name="subject">input-output analysis</field><field name="subject">direct energy</field><field name="subject">energy path</field><field name="subject">residential building construction</field><field name="subject">modification</field><field name="subject">manufacture of steel structural members</field><field name="subject">ecological sustainability</field><field name="subject">human activity</field><field name="subject">national statistical</field><field name="subject">&#145;black box&#146;</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20041209.161722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical intellectual resources for praxis in 
physical education teacher education: 
The limits to rationality.</field><field name="creator">Hickey, Christopher J.</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the way four student-teachers engage with critical social discourses in a year-long physical education unit.  The student-teachers were encouraged to examine and (re)construct their pedagogy through their interactions with critical discourses.  Drawing on their personal theories and actions, the study examines the extent to which critical intellectual resources can provide pedagogical frames of reference that are 'practical and non-ideal'.  Using a critical ethnographic methodology the students' interactions with critical social discourses are diagnosed across three levels.  The first level is the case study presentations of each student's engagement with the critical intellectual resources and the extent to which they were able to understand and implement them.  The second level involves an interpretation of the individual cases that is informed by Brian Fay's (1987) metatheoretical reconstruction of the critical social sciences.  In the third stage of diagnosis the study focuses on retheorising critical aspirations for praxis pedagogy in physical education.   

Critical scholars within the physical education arena argue that critical praxis represents a pedagogy based on a 'world view' of the potential for agents to engage in a rational reordering of their qualitative existence.  The essence of their claim is that critical discourses have the potential to facilitate a mode of praxis through which physical education teachers might better recognise, understand, critique and transform their values and practices.  However, there is broad recognition that the translation of social-critical discourses into a pedagogic context is highly problematic.  

Interpretation of the study is provided by Fay's (1987) 'limits to change' thesis which recognises that critical aspirations must ultimately be adopted and implemented by real people in real settings.  As a diagnostic frame of reference, Fay insists that a 'complete' critical theory [of physical education] be simultaneously scientific, critical, practical and non-ideal.  In seeking to temper the &amp;quote
over-rationalistic&amp;quote
 tendency of the critical project he recognises the historical, embedded, embodied and traditional nature of human existence

Criticisms of critical theories of education traverse a number of philosophic perspectives. Recent post-structural criticisms of truth regimes, knowledge-power differentials, rationality and agency have seriously destabilised modernist justifications of the critical agenda.  Critical theories of physical education have not been absolved of such criticism.  A prominent element of this study is its promotion of a dialectical relationship between agency and structure to extend critical conceptualisations of physical education pedagogy.  Through the mediation of structural determinism and self-determination this research proffers a means of practically advancing a critical praxis in physical education.  The conclusion of this thesis outlines some broad recommendations pertaining to the introduction of social critical discourses in physical education teacher education.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical intellectual resources</field><field name="subject">physical education</field><field name="subject">teacher education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20041209.170039</field></doc><doc><field name="title">(RE)PRODUCING POWER-KNOWLEDGE-DESIRE: YOUNG WOMEN AND DISCOURSES OF IDENTITY</field><field name="creator">HARRISON, LYN MARGARET</field><field name="description">This study focuses on three young women in their final year of school using data gathered during a year-long process of individual conversational interviews, the contents of which were largely determined by their interests. Three themes arise from critical incidents during this year - the debutante ball, teenage pregnancy and dieting. These themes are used to focus wide ranging explorations of what it is to be a young woman at this particular time. The broader cultural production of discursive positions available to, and developed by, these young women as part of their identity formation is discussed. Methodological issues concerning power relationships between research participants are also the focus of critical attention.
It is considered that young women's bodies and bodily practices are central to understanding the processes involved in their identity formation. It is in this context that the focus turns to bodies that matter. In contemporary Western cultures 'adolescent bodies' could be said to matter 'too much' in the sense that they are increasingly the focus for disciplinary practices in institutions such as schooling, the church, the family, health care, health promotion and the media. This disciplining is legitimised because adolescence is socially constructed as a 'becoming'. In this case it is a matter of 'becoming woman'; a sort of apprenticeship which allows for knowledgeable others to provide not only guidance and nurturance, but discipline. Using insights gained from feminist poststructuralist theory and cultural feminism this thesis argues that the discourses and practices generated within and across institutions, which are normalised by their institutional base, are gender differentiated. The focus is on young women's embodied subjectivity and how the discourses and practices they engage with and in work to construct an ideal feminine body-subject.
The discursive production of a gendered identity has a considerable impact on young women's health and their health-related behaviours. This is explored specifically in the thesis in relation to sexuality and the cultural production of the 'ideal' female body. It is argued that health education and health promotion strategies which are designed to influence young women's health related behaviours, need to consider the forms of power, knowledge and desire produced through young women's active engagement with institutionalised discourses of identity if they are to have an ongoing impact</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">POWER-KNOWLEDGE-DESIRE</field><field name="subject">YOUNG WOMEN</field><field name="subject">DISCOURSES OF IDENTITY</field><field name="subject">debutante ball</field><field name="subject">teenage pregnancy and dieting</field><field name="subject">identity formation</field><field name="subject">final year of school</field><field name="subject">Western cultures</field><field name="subject">adolescent bodies</field><field name="subject">institutions such as schooling</field><field name="subject">the church</field><field name="subject">the family</field><field name="subject">health care</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">feminist poststructuralist theory</field><field name="subject">cultural feminism</field><field name="subject">gender differentiated</field><field name="subject">ideal feminine body-subject</field><field name="subject">health-related behaviours</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20041214.103936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CASE STUDIES IN HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION AND CRITICAL EDUCATIONAL SCIENCE</field><field name="creator">Henry, Colin</field><field name="description">This thesis offers an account of the history and effects of three curriculum projects sponsored by the Australian Human Rights Commission between 1983 and 1986. Each project attempted to improve observance of human rights in and through Australian schools through participatory research (or critical educational science). That is, the research included, as a conscious feature, the effort to develop new forms of curriculum work which more adequately respect the personal and professional rights of teachers, especially their entitlement as persons and professionals to participate in planning, conducting and controlling the curriculum development, evaluation and implementation that constitutes their work. In more specific terms, the Australian Human Rights Commission's three curriculum projects represented an attempt to improve the practice and theory of human rights education by engaging teachers in the practical work of evaluating, researching, and developing a human rights curriculum.
While the account of the Australian Human Rights Commission curriculum project is substantially an account of teachers1 work, it is a story which ranges well beyond the boundaries of schools and classrooms. It encompasses a history of episodes and events which illustrate how educational initiatives and their fate will often have to set within the broad framework of political, social, and cultural contestation if they are to be understood. More exactly, although the Human Rights Commission's work with schools was instrumental in showing how teachers might contribute to the challenging task of improving human rights education, the project was brought to a premature halt during the debate in the Australian Senate on the Bill of Rights in late 1985 and early 1986. At this point in time, the Government was confronted with such opposition from the Liberal/National Party Coalition that it was obliged to withdraw its Bill of Rights Legislation, close down the original Human Rights Commission, and abandon the attempt to develop a nationwide program in human rights education. The research presents an explanation of why it has been difficult for the Australian Government to live up to its international obligations to improve respect for human rights through education. More positively, however, it shows how human rights education, human rights related areas of education, and social education might be transformed if teachers (and other members of schools communities) were given opportunities to contribute to that task. Such opportunities, moreover, also represent what might be called the practice of democracy in everyday life. They thus exemplify, as well as prefigure, what it might mean to live in a more authentically democratic society.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Government</field><field name="subject">Liberal/National Party Coalition</field><field name="subject">Bill of Rights</field><field name="subject">Australian Senate</field><field name="subject">Australian Human Rights Commission's</field><field name="subject">curriculum projects</field><field name="subject">human rights education</field><field name="subject">human rights related areas of education</field><field name="subject">social education</field><field name="subject">school communities</field><field name="subject">democratic society</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20041214.144057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender and Genre: A Case Study of a Girl and a Boy Learning to Write</field><field name="creator">Kamler, Barbara</field><field name="description">This study addresses questions of gender and genre in early writing by drawing on systemic linguistic theory, It is a longitudinal case study that compares the writing development of two children, a boy and a girl/ who learned to write in classrooms that adopted an approach to writing known in Australia as 'process writing1, The children's written texts were analysed using the systemic functional grammar as developed by MAK, Hallidey and the models of genre and register as proposed by J,R, Martin.
The children were followed for the first two and a half years of their schooling, from the first day of kindergarten to the middle of grade two. They were observed weekly during the daily &#145;writing time&#146; and all texts were collected.   Although the children were ostensibly 'free&#146; to determine both the writing topics and text types they produced, systemic analysis revealed that:
1)      the majority of texts written were of one genre, the Observation genre, in which the children reconstructed their personal experience with family and friends and offered an evaluation of it.
2)      a significant pattern of gender differences occurred within this genre, such that the boy reconstructed experience in terms of the male cultural stereotype of being an active participant in the world, while the girl reconstructed experience in terms of the female stereotype of being a more passive observer of experience.
It is the strength of systemic linguistic analysis that it revealed how the choices the children made in language were constrained by a number of social and cultural contexts, including: a) the teacher's theoretical orientation to literacy; b) the models of spoken and written language available to the children; and c) the ideology of gender in the culture. In particular, the analysis made visible how children appropriate the meanings of their culture and socialise themselves into gender roles by constructing the ideology of gender in their writing.
The study contributes to an understanding of genres by offering a revised description of the Observation genre, which derives from the Observation Comment genre originally identified by Martin and Rothery (1981). It also raises a number of implications for teacher training and classroom practice, including the need for:
1)      increased teacher consciousness about gender and genre, especially an understanding that choices in language are socially constructed
2)      a critical reassessment of the notion of 'free topic choice&#146; promoted by 'process writing'  pedagogy, a practice which may limit choice and tacitly support the gender status quo.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Genre</field><field name="subject">Girl</field><field name="subject">Boy</field><field name="subject">Learning to Write</field><field name="subject">language literacy</field><field name="subject">written language</field><field name="subject">gender roles</field><field name="subject">teacher training</field><field name="subject">classroom practice</field><field name="subject">free topic choice</field><field name="subject">linguistic theory</field><field name="subject">schooling</field><field name="subject">systemic functional grammar</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20041214.164647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Little boys: the potency of peer culture 
in shaping masculinities</field><field name="creator">Keddie, Amanda</field><field name="description">This study explores the peer group understandings of five male friends between the ages of six and eight years and seeks to examine the ways in which the group&#146;s social dynamics interact to define, regulate and maintain dominant and collective understandings of masculinities.  Within a self-selected affinity context, and drawing on their lived and imagined experiences, the boys&#146; enact and interpret their social worlds.

Adopting the principles of ethnography within a framework of feminist poststructuralism and drawing on theories of &#145;groupness&#146; and gender(ed) embodiment, the boys&#146; understandings of masculinities are captured and interpreted.  The key analytic foci are directed towards examining the role of power in the social production of collective schoolboy knowledges, and understanding the processes through which boys subjectify and are subjectified, through social but also bodily discourses.  The boys&#146; constructions of peer group masculinities are (re)presented through a narrative methodology which foregrounds my interpretation of the group&#146;s personal and social relevances and seeks to be inductive in ways that &#145;bring to life&#146; the boys&#146; stories.  

The study illuminates the potency of peer culture in shaping and regulating the boys&#146; dominant understandings of masculinity.  Within this culture strong essentialist and hierarchical values are imported to support a range of gender(ed) and sexual dualisms.  Here patriarchal adult culture is regularly mimicked and distorted.  Underpinned by constructions of &#145;femininity&#146; as the negative &#145;other&#146;, dominant masculinities are embodied, cultivated and championed through physical dominance, physical risk, aggression and violence.  

Through feminist poststructural analysis which enables a theorising of the boys&#146; subjectivities as fluid, tenuous and often characterised by contradiction and resistance, there exists a potential for interrupting and re-working particular masculinities.  Within this framework, more affirmative but equally legitimate understandings and embodiments can be explored.  The study presents a warrant for working with early childhood affinity groups to disrupt and contest the dominance and hierarchy of peer culture in an effort to counter-act broader gendered and heterosexist global, state and institutional structures.  Framing these assertions is an understanding of the peer context as not only self-limiting and productive of hierarchies, but enabling and generative of affirmative subjectivities.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Little boys</field><field name="subject">peer culture</field><field name="subject">masculinities</field><field name="subject">male friends</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">social relevances</field><field name="subject">physical dominance</field><field name="subject">physical risk</field><field name="subject">aggression</field><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="subject">hierarchical values</field><field name="subject">boys stories</field><field name="subject">key analytic foci</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20041216.100720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thaipusam in Malaysia : A Hindu festival misunderstood?</field><field name="creator">Belle, Carl Vadivella</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thaipusam</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Hindu festival</field><field name="subject">Hinduism</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050705.110706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prostate cancer : Anglo-Australian heterosexual perspectives</field><field name="creator">Oliffe, John</field><field name="description">Prostate cancer is one of the most prominent diseases in men&#146;s health. It is inherently 'male', given the exclusivity of the prostate gland to men&#146;s bodies and its physiological connection to testosterone and male sexuality. The biomedical complexities of prostate cancer continue to be unravelled and researched and are often connected to identifying causes, the virtues of screening and treatment modalities. However, despite the biological male 'sex' link, most of the prostate cancer research is not connected with research on gender relations, men and masculinities. The net outcome is that men&#146;s lives and illness experiences are absent in much of the prostate cancer research.

Underlying this contestation dynamic lie competing value systems about the social purpose of education; competing values around which are generated different discourses, and which in turn generate inherently contradictory social and organisational structures. As reflected in other areas of society, the 20th century expansion of state-provided schooling has essentially developed around variations of a bureaucratic model Thus, organisational cultures based around bureaucratic values have come to permeate the enterprise of schooling on a world wide scale. Concomitantly, the value for education to be fundamentally associated with human emancipation from psychological, social, political, or economic states of being, persists as a recurring theme in modern schooling. Premised on these understandings, the thesis argues that the development of the practices of school psychology as a profession, like education in general, and special education in particular, has similarly been influenced by tensions between different and competing constellations of values. It is argued that throughout the 20th century, the pervasiveness of formal schooling systems suggest that schooling may be understood as a modernist cultural archetype. As a socially constructed reality, the phenomenon of schooling has become unproblematic the apparent cultural inevitability of formal schooling in the modern era can also be understood as a premise of a systemised way of looking at the world; that of bureaucratic consciousness. Dialectically, bureaucratic consciousness persists in influencing every manifestation of schooling; structurally through its organisational forms, and epistemologically through the institutionalization of teaching and learning. A particular illustration of the dialectical relationship between bureaucratic consciousness and the social forms and social practices of schooling is the school psychology profession which has developed as a part of school systems. The thesis argues that the epistemic archeology of psychology as a knowledge discipline can be traced through an earlier European intellectual and cultural tradition, but in the 20th century, has come to develop a symbiotic yet contradictory relationship with compulsory schooling in the modern nation state. The research study employs historical and fieldwork methods in a study of the development of the school psychology services within the Victorian Education Department, particularly between 1947 and 1987. The thesis also draws upon several usually distinct literatures; the philosophical and theoretical discourse of modernity and post modernity, the history and development of modern schooling, the ethnography of schooling, the international comparative literature on the school psychology profession, and the literature on action research in education practice and curriculum development, As a case study of Victorian school psychology, the research eschews a quantitative statistical approach in favour of qualitative investigatory genres, which have in turn been guided by the values of action research in education, as well as those of critical theory. The important focus of the thesis is its investigation of some aspects of the development and transformations within the Victorian state education bureaucracy, and the dialectical relationship that has persisted between the evolution of change processes and the shifting conceptions of school psychology practices in the 20th century. A history of the organisational development of school psychology services in Victoria constitutes an important part of the thesis. This is complemented by specific illustrations of how some school psychologists have been influenced by and have contributed towards paradigm shifts within the profession, shifts relating to how the changing nature of their work practices have come to be understood and valued by teachers and by school administrators. The work of J. R. MacLeod from the 1950s is noted in this regard. Particular attention is also drawn to the dialectical relationship between bureaucratic consciousness and school psychology's professional orientation in the 1980s. As a means of providing field data to explore this relationship, ethnographic case studies with two school communities are included as part of the fieldwork of the thesis, and are based upon the author's own work in the mid 1980s. These case studies provide a basis for conceptually refraining the school psychologist's professional experience within schooling systems, and an opportunity to examine how competing value systems impact upon the work of the school psychologist. The thesis concludes with some observations about bureaucratic transformations within educational organisations, and about the future relationship of the school psychology profession with schooling systems, as framed by the theoretical parameters of the modernist /post modernist debate. The issue of competing value systems within the administration of public education is re-examined as is the value of promoting human empowerment in the ongoing work of the school psychologist.

Only more recently has there been a focus on assessing the relationship between aspects of the abuse and specific psychological difficulties.  This thesis investigated the relationships between CSA characteristics and women&#146;s later psychological adjustment.  The role of attributions, coping methods, parenting competency and marital satisfaction were also investigated.  Qualitative data on perception of benefit and general reflections of participants were used to explore participants&#146; self-esteem, locus of control, decisions relating to parenting, disclosure experiences, and attributions in relation to their abuse, including the search for meaning.  Recruitment through newspapers and counselling services led to 118 women volunteering to complete a questionnaire evaluating the characteristics of their CSA and their current psychological adjustment.  Of this group, 33 subsequently volunteered to participate in a telephone interview that explored in greater depth issues related to the long-term impact of their CSA.  Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted on the data.  The women reported a high prevalence of dysfunction in their families of origin.  Abuse had generally commenced by middle childhood, and lasted for a number of years and often involved a number of perpetrators.  Perpetrators were most likely to be intrafamilial, with stepfathers being over-represented.  Sexual activities generally involved physical contact, with participation often induced by the use of coercion.  Participants demonstrated significant difficulties in psychological adjustment, but attributions regarding the abuse improved over time.  Some concerns were expressed regarding parenting competency, and avoidant coping methods were favoured.  In general, participants were satisfied with their current marital relationship.  Significant associations were found between coping methods, attributional style, beliefs and various psychological adjustment measures.  Participants, in general, demonstrated low self-esteem and displayed an external locus of control.  As a consequence of their experience of CSA, many participants reported they had decided not to have children.  For those who did have children, CSA was almost universally seen as having had an impact on their parenting.  Disclosure of CSA was usually delayed for a number of years, with poor outcomes generally resulting from disclosure when it occurred.  Women with current partners rated them as very caring and not controlling.  Participants were generally still searching for meaning in their abuse, despite many having accepted it.  Survivors outlined an extensive range of long-term effects of CSA, and nominated a number of strategies that would assist in reducing these effects.  The results of the study indicated that there are a number of characteristics associated with CSA which signal a higher risk of difficulties in psychological adjustment.  Concerns of survivors regarding parenting were confirmed according to those who undertook this role.  Unfortunately, concerns expressed by survivors that disclosure of their CSA would have had negative consequences was usually the case when they did finally disclose.  However, the accessing of social and family support appeared to have an important role in changing the attributions of survivors regarding their CSA.  Furthermore, change of attributions in relation to abuse may provide the key to resilience in survivors against the negative impact of CSA on later psychological adjustment.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adult child sexual abuse victims</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">incest victims</field><field name="subject">custody of children</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050722.150048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining moments in men's lives: A study of personal narratives</field><field name="creator">Boyer, Duane</field><field name="description">This study explores the defining moments in six men&#146;s lives. The empirical dimension of the research is built around the personal narratives these men tell of their lives across a series of four interviews. The central research theme is the notion of the defining moment as a key element in the processes of establishing how men understand and interpret the events and incidents that have shaped their lives. In the context of this study, the defining moment is seen as the moment or period in time when an individual gives definition to a specific event or experience, as a transition point with (potentially) life-altering consequences. Some of the thematic structures presented include relationships with significant adults (parents, teachers), masculinity, self-harm, schooling, mental illness, isolation, loneliness, stress and relationships with peers.

In my pursuit of a methodology that could accommodate the aims of this study, I explored the process of meaning through the qualitative paradigm. Drawing on the principles of qualitative research, as applied through narrative inquiry, I deployed a semi-structured interview format to collect the lived experiences of participants. By privileging the stories that individuals tell of their experiences, the narrative method recognises that data are inexorably located in the contextual and contingent. The experiences and narratives that are presented in this thesis are built around the authentic voices of participants.

The study presents a warrant for working with men&#146;s defining moments to disrupt, alter and redefine their attitudes and behaviours in order to improve their lives. Based on the insights gleaned through this study, I argue that there are defining times/points in people&#146;s lives where their experiences can be life altering. When these experiences involve uncertainty, anxiety, stress and other pernicious effects, their longer-term consequences can be devastating. The study confirms existing research, that men are reluctant to seek help or reveal their insecurities during such times, therefore making them particularly vulnerable to defining moments.

The conclusion of this thesis establishes some broad recommendations pertaining to working effectively with men and their defining moments. I focus particular attention on the place of schooling and education in helping individuals recognise and respond to the early symptoms of what is potentially a life-altering experience. Schools and, by association, teachers need to be actively and strategically involved in this process. To this end, I argue the need for targeted interventions that are both sensitive and timely. In their engagements with young males, parents, teachers, coaches and mentors need to be particularly attuned to their silent screams for help.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Men's health</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">hygiene</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">counseling</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050727.123714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The determination of rate constants using microelectrodes.</field><field name="creator">Mahon, Peter John</field><field name="description">An understanding of the rate and the mechanism of reaction is of fundamental importance in the many facets of chemistry. Electrochemical systems are further complicated by the heterogeneous boundary, between the solution and the electrode, that the electron passes through before any electrochemical reaction can take place.
This thesis concerns the development of methods for analysing electrode kinetics. One part involves the further development of the Global Analysis procedure to include electrodes with a spherical geometry which are traditionally the most popular form of electrodes. Simulated data is analysed to ascertain the accuracy of the procedure and then the known artifacts of uncompensated solution resistance and charging current are added to the simulated data so that the effects can be observed. The experimental analysis of 2-methyl-2-nitropropane is undertaken and comparisons are made with the Marcus-Hush electrochemical theories concerning electrode kinetics.
A related section explores procedures for the kinetic analysis of steady state voltammetric data obtained at microdisc electrodes. A method is proposed under the name of Normalised Steady State Voltammetry and is tested using data obtained from a Fast Quasi-Explicit Finite Difference simulation of diffusion to a microdisc electrode.
In a second area of work using microelectrodes, the electrochemical behaviour of compounds of the general formula M(CO)3(&#951;3 - P2P1) where M is either Cr, Mo or W and P2P' is bis(2-diphenylphosphinoethyl)phenylphosphine) is elucidated. The development of instrumentation and mathematical procedures relevant to the measurement and quantitation of these systems is also investigated.

The aim of this thesis is to describe the process by which the inherited disease, cystic fibrosis, (CF) was recognised as an important clinical entity in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Sultanate of Oman (Oman). It examines the clinical presentation of the first patients and assesses their degree of severity. Further, it describes the first studies carried out to determine the underlying CF mutations associated with the disease in the UAE and Oman. An estimate is offered of the birth frequency of the condition. Overall, the cultural, geographical and historical aspect of the societies in which the disease occurs is stressed.
Methods:
An initial literature search was carried out using Medline of any literature pertaining to the
Arab World and CF. this was read and classified into the relevance to Arabs in general, the
Middle East and then specifically the Arab (Persian) Gulf societies.
Thereafter, a clinic was established at Tawam Hospital, Al Ain, UAE, for children presenting
With chronic respiratory disease that could serve as a national referral centre. It was run by the
Author as a service of the Paediatric Department of the UAE University Medical School. I sent
a letter to every Paediatrician working in the UAE informing them of our clinic and offering
our services for the diagnosis and management of chronic respiratory disease in children. This
was based on the author's experience as a respiratory paediatrician in Australia and New
 
Zealand and as the Professor of Paediatrics in the UAE. No such service then existed in the UAE.
Funding was sought to establish a research programme and develop a molecular genetics laboratory in the UAE Medical School. A series of successful research applications provided the grants to commence the investigations. Once a small number of children had been identified as having CF from those referred to the respiratory clinic, the initial project was to assess and report their clinical presentation. Following this an early start was made on the identification of the mutations responsible. Once these were established an attempt was made to estimate the frequency of the condition at birth.
Additional clinical studies revolved around assessing the severity of the condition that was associated with the main mutations that were identified. A clinical comparison was made with those with the mutation AF508 and the other main mutation, despite the obvious limitation of small numbers then available. Radiological assessment was made to evaluate the progression of the disease.
The final aspect of the study was to assess patients from Oman and compare their findings and mutations with the neighbouring UAE. Based on information gained hypotheses are proposed regarding the spread of the gene mutation by population drift.
Thesis outline:
A literature review is presented in the form of a critique on the disease and a resume of the relevant aspects of the genetics of CF. Additionally, facts about the two countries' geography and history are presented. Finally, knowledge about CF mutations and population origins from other areas is presented.
 
The second main section deals with the clinical features of the disorder as it presents in the UAE. Molecular findings are then presented and details of the common mutation found in Bedouin Arabs. Hypotheses are then presented based on the information gathered.
Results:
CF is not a rare disease in the Arab children of the UAE and Oman. These findings refute previous reports of CF being a rare or non-existent disease in Arabs. The condition presents with a severe clinical picture, with early colonisation of the respiratory tract with staphylococcus, haemophilus and pseudomonas organisms, even with conventional CF management practices in place.
The CF mutation S549R is prevalent in Arabs of Bedouin stock, while AF508 is found in those of Baluch origin. The former may be descendants of Arabs who left southern Arabia and travelled to the Trucial Coast at the time of the destruction of the great dam at Marib. The origins of this mutation may lie in the area that corresponds to the modern Republic of Yemen. The latter groups are descendants of those who came originally from Baluchistan. It is hypothesised also that the ancestral home of the AF508 mutation may be in the geographical area now known as Baluchistan, that spans three separate modern political territories. The evidence presented supports the concept that the S549R mutation may be associated with a severe, if not the severest, clinical pattern recognised. It equates with that seen with the homozygous AF508 genotype. The absence of an additional mutation in the promoter region accounts for the different clinical pattern seen in previously described patients.
Conclusions:
 
There needs to be a major awareness of the presence of CF as a severe clinical disease in the children of the Gulf States. The clinical presentation and findings support the concept of under recognition of the disease. Climatic conditions put the children at special risk of hyponatraemia and electrolyte imbalance. The absence of surviving adults with the disease suggests premature deaths have occurred, but the high fertility rates have maintained the gene pool for this recessive disorder.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cystic fibrosis in children</field><field name="subject">United Arab Emirates</field><field name="subject">Oman</field><field name="subject">clinical study</field><field name="subject">Eastern Arabian Peninsula</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050728.091141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical care nurses' haemodynamic decision making</field><field name="creator">Currey, Judy A</field><field name="description">For cardiac surgical patients, the immediate 2-hour recovery period is distinguished by potentially life-threatening haemodynamic instability. To ensure optimum patient outcomes, nurses of varying levels of experience must make rapid and accurate decisions in response to episodes of haemodynamic instability. Decision complexity, nurses&#146; characteristics, and environmental characteristics, have each been found to influence nurses' decision making in some form. However, the effect of the interplay between these influences on decision outcomes has not been investigated. The aim of the research reported in this thesis was to explore variability in critical care nurses' haemodynamic decision making as a function of interplay between haemodynamic decision complexity, nurses' experience, and specific environmental characteristics by applying a naturalistic decision making design.
Thirty-eight nurses were observed recovering patients in the immediate 2-hour period after cardiac surgery. A follow-up semi-structured interview was conducted. A naturalistic decision making approach was used. An organising framework for the goals of therapy related to maintaining haemodynamic stability after cardiac surgery was developed to assist the observation and analysis of practice. The three goals of therapy were the optimisation of cardiovascular performance, the promotion of haemostasia, and the reestablishment of normothermia. The research was conducted in two phases. Phase One explored issues related to observation as method, and identified emergent themes. Phase Two incorporated findings of Phase 1, investigating the variability in nurses' haemodynamic decision making in relation to the three goals of therapy.
The findings showed that patients had a high acuity after cardiac surgery and suffered numerous episodes of haemodynamic instability during the immediate 2-hour recovery period. The quality of nurses' decision making in relation to the three goals of therapy was influenced by the experience of the nurse and social interactions with colleagues. Experienced nurses demonstrated decision making that reflected the ability to recognise subtle changes in haemodynamic cues, integrate complex combinations of cues, and respond rapidly to instability. The quality of inexperienced nurses' decision making varied according to the level and form of decision support as well as the
 
complexity of the task. When assistance was provided by nursing colleagues during the reception and recovery of patients, the characteristics of team decision making were observed. Team decision making in this context was categorised as either integrated or non integrated. Team decision making influenced nurses' emotions and actions and decision making practices. Findings revealed nurses' experience affected interactions with other team members and their perceptions of assuming responsibility for complex patients.
Interplay between decision complexity, nurses' experience, and the environment in which decisions were made influenced the quality of nurses' decision making and created an environment of team decision making, which, in turn, influenced nurses' emotional responses and practice outcomes. The observed variability in haemodynamic decision making has implications for nurse education, nursing practice, and system processes regarding patient allocation and clinical supervision.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intensive care nursing</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">surgical nursing</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular system</field><field name="subject">haemodynamic monitoring</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050728.094123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning from large data : Bias, variance, sampling, and learning curves</field><field name="creator">Brain, Damien</field><field name="description">One of the fundamental machine learning tasks is that of predictive classification. Given that organisations collect an ever increasing amount of data, predictive classification methods must be able to effectively and efficiently handle large amounts of data. However, it is understood that present requirements push existing algorithms to, and sometimes beyond, their limits since many classification prediction algorithms were designed when currently common data set sizes were beyond imagination.
This has led to a significant amount of research into ways of making classification learning algorithms more effective and efficient. Although substantial progress has been made, a number of key questions have not been answered.
This dissertation investigates two of these key questions. The first is whether different types of algorithms to those currently employed are required when using large data sets. This is answered by analysis of the way in which the bias plus variance decomposition of predictive classification error changes as training set size is increased. Experiments find that larger training sets require different types of algorithms to those currently used. Some insight into the characteristics of suitable algorithms is provided, and this may provide some direction for the development of future classification prediction algorithms which are specifically designed for use with large data sets.
The second question investigated is that of the role of sampling in machine learning with large data sets. Sampling has long been used as a means of avoiding the need to scale up algorithms to suit the size of the data set by scaling down the size of the data sets to suit the algorithm. However, the costs of performing sampling have not been widely explored. Two popular sampling methods are compared with learning from all available data in terms of predictive accuracy,
 
model complexity, and execution time. The comparison shows that sub-sampling generally products models with accuracy close to, and sometimes greater than, that obtainable from learning with all available data. This result suggests that it may be possible to develop algorithms that take advantage of the sub-sampling methodology to reduce the time required to infer a model while sacrificing little if any accuracy.
Methods of improving effective and efficient learning via sampling are also investigated, and now sampling methodologies proposed. These methodologies include using a varying-proportion of instances to determine the next inference step and using a statistical calculation at each inference step to determine sufficient sample size. Experiments show that using a statistical calculation of sample size can not only substantially reduce execution time but can do so with only a small loss, and occasional gain, in accuracy.
One of the common uses of sampling is in the construction of learning curves. Learning curves are often used to attempt to determine the optimal training size which will maximally reduce execution time while nut being detrimental to accuracy. An analysis of the performance of methods for detection of convergence of learning curves is performed, with the focus of the analysis on methods that calculate the gradient, of the tangent to the curve. Given that such methods can be susceptible to local accuracy plateaus, an investigation into the frequency of local plateaus is also performed. It is shown that local accuracy plateaus are a common occurrence, and that ensuring a small loss of accuracy often results in greater computational cost than learning from all available data. These results cast doubt over the applicability of gradient of tangent methods for detecting convergence, and of the viability of learning curves for reducing execution time in general.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">database searching</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050728.095343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of assessing family dysfunction in conjuction with standardised measures when treating substance abuse.</field><field name="creator">Panagopoulos, Irene</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the link between substance abuse and family dysfunction is examined, and an argument is made for the assessment of family dysfunction when treating clients with substance abuse issues. Family dysfunction has been associated with a broad range of problems in children (e.g., low self esteem, increased risk of child abuse) through to adolescence and adulthood (e.g., increased risk of mental disorders such as depressive disorders, substance abuse disorders, and personality disorders) (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998). It is not the purpose of this thesis to suggest that family dysfunction causes substance abuse but rather to highlight that family dysfunction can in some cases place the individual at greater risk of substance abuse. Therefore, in order to understand the reasons why substance abuse developed and how it is maintained in the present requires the assessment of family dysfunction. Further, the importance of assessing the role and impact that family dysfunction may have had on the client, may help to better understand the nature and extent of substance abuse so that relevant and appropriate treatment goals for change may be set, progress monitored, and risk of relapse reduced. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to this thesis, and Chapter 2 is a review of the literature on the impact of family dysfunction including poor parental attachment and supervision, neglect, physical and sexual abuse, in adolescence and adulthood. Four case studies are presented to illustrate how family dysfunction and substance abuse may be related, thus highlighting the importance of assessing family dysfunction when treating substance abuse clients. All of the case studies include an individual with a substance abuse disorder (namely heroin) but they are diverse in terms of the types and extent of family dysfunction. The final chapter discusses the case studies in relation to the literature reviewed. Lastly, it gives consideration to the implication of a history of family dysfunction, and how it may impact negatively on treatment and therefore prognosis.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">family assessment</field><field name="subject">drug abuse</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">family dysfunction</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050728.100552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remaking the body : Explorations in the sociology of embodiment</field><field name="creator">Seymour, Wendy</field><field name="description">As embodied social agents our lives are preoccupied with the production and reproduction of bodies. Making, unmaking and remaking our embodiment are ongoing activities. Eating, exercise, washing, grooming, dressing, for example, are activities in which the body engages in routine tasks of bodily management. Such activities can be seen as everyday rehabilitation.
The study explores the impact of major physical impairment on embodiment, and on the processes involved in re-embodiment after catastrophic injury or disease. The experiences of the people in this study dramatically highlight the continuous, but largely taken for granted processes involved in our embodiment.
Four analytical strands are interwoven throughout the study. The first strand relates to the frailty and vulnerability of the human body, characteristics which are epitomised by the bodies of the informants in this study. The second strand engages with key aspects of the context in which re-embodiment takes place, namely a context replete with crisis, danger, fear, uncertainty and risk. The third strand projects into the future in considering the ongoing project of self. The fourth strand addresses the institutional and social impediments which may confine vulnerable bodies and limit the exploration of more expansive bodies.
The study is situated within the general theoretical approach of the sociology of the body. While recognizing the powerful impact of social discourse in the production of bodies, the study focuses on the critical role of embodiment in the reconstitution of self. The people in this study have experienced profound bodily change, but although this damage has disrupted, it has not annihilated their embodied selves. The people still possess and occupy their bodies. It is the obduracy of embodiment which directs the processes involved in remaking the body.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social medicine</field><field name="subject">paraplegics</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">quadriplegics</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050728.111439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a model to explain the sexual beliefs, intentions and behaviours of adolescents and young adults</field><field name="creator">Killackey, Eoin Joseph</field><field name="description">In the last thirty years there have been many research studies which have examined the reasons why adolescents and young adults engage in sexual behaviours. Most of these studies have lacked a theoretical basis, Consequently there are many links made between variables, but no consistency across studies, or attempts to develop an underlying theory to explain the results. However, there have been theoretical models developed to explain adolescents&#146; and young adults&#146; sexual decision making.  Unfortunately, many of these models have not been empirically validated. This thesis attempts to address these deficiencies in the literature by utilising a theory of behaviour and applying it to adolescent and young adult sexual decision making. This theory is the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Two longitudinal studies were conducted to examine the utility of an adaptation of the TPB to sexual decision making among adolescents and young adults. In the first study 58 adolescent males, aged between 14 years and 18 years participated in a longitudinal study using a questionnaire adapted from the Depth of Sexual Involvement Scale. In the second study, 194 young adults (156 female, 38 male) aged between 18 years and 21 years participated in a similar study. The first study found that intention to engage in behaviour was well predicted, although some of the variables in the model, did not in fact, contribute significantly to the prediction. The prediction of behaviour was less strong than that of intention. Study two found that intention to engage in behaviours was well predicted by the model. However, the degree to which intention led to behaviour was not well predicted. Overall, the results of these studies suggest that the TPB is a good theoretical basis from which to launch a systematic and theoretically informed explanation of adolescent and young adult sexual decision making. However, other factors may need to be added to the model to fully describe the decision making process and accurately predict behaviour. Suggestions are made for future research, as well as interventions that may arise as more knowledge is gathered using this paradigm.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision making in adolescense</field><field name="subject">sexual behaviour surveys</field><field name="subject">young adults</field><field name="subject">sexual behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050728.112619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crossing bowen street: Mapping interventios in the classed subject.</field><field name="creator">Hegarty, Kathryn</field><field name="description">Synopsis: Crossing Bowen Street
Crossing Bowen Street is an extended novel set in Melbourne, Australia. The protagonist, Meg Flanagan, is accepted to teachers' college. Meg is 24 years old and has worked, and lived out of home, since 17. Having completed her year 12 studies part time while working, she has applied to the Melbourne State College for a Bachelor of Education. Melbourne State College is subsequently 'amalgamated'A into Philip University, the original 19th century sandstone institution which borders MSC.
Meg has worked as a medical secretary prior to commencing her studies. An only child, she is the first member of her family to go to university, indeed to finish high school. Tertiary study is exciting for Meg and the novel explores the psychic journey as well as the intellectual one, as Meg experiences challenges to the possibilities for her life and the trajectory along which she once assumed it would flow. The narrative is told through episodic and epistolary forms, with particular periods in Meg's cultural and academic life forming the focus, picking up the integral elements of her journey and examining the psychic context and action.
Characters in the undergraduate chapters of the novel are somewhat transient, although very important to Meg's rapidly developing, changing sense of herself. The constant 'trying out' of ways of being and even lifestyles sees Meg losing old 'friendships' and making new, even temporary, ones all the time. This allows the opportunity for Meg to explore her feelings about connecting to others and the nature of her relationships. The Meg reflected back to her by others is of constant interest to her, particularly as she is frequently reminded that others see a very different Meg than she does.
The novel commences at the outset of Meg's tertiary career, as she initially articulates the extent of her aspiration, of her sense of the possibility of her own life. Each vignette deals, chronologically, with an aspect of Meg's expanding sense of possibility, socially, emotionally, intellectually. Certain vignettes explore her relations with friends and acquaintances in the course, which in turn provide
A In 1988, Federal Labor Minister for Education John Dawkins, devised a plan to end the streaming of Australian tertiary institutions and created what is called the Unified National System. This meant that colleges of advanced education and institutes of technology were either created universities in their own right, or more commonly, merged with an appropriate existing university. This process allows a fascinating insight into the class dimensions of hierarchies and stratifications. The need of universities and their members for status has been profoundly underscored.
 
the background and context for her sexual relationships. That aspect of her developing subjectivity provides a marked contrast, which Meg uses as leverage, when set against her sense of herself as a scholar and her growing notion of entitlement, which allows her to 'choose', where previously she believed she had no choice; the choice is a scholarly career. Within all this, Meg discovers and is deeply empowered by certain political left, and feminist, discourses within the university community. She is equally dismayed and alienated by other feminist practices; her growing engagement with her own agency sees her quickly abandoning feminist subject positions previously dear to her, which served a particular purpose and are now superseded. This notion of feeling betrayed by the promise of a value system (or rather, its practitioners) will recur throughout the action of the novel, as Meg moves into an academic role, first as doctoral student and then as academic, seeking to live her values as practice and to remain true to what her trajectory has taught her. This is crystallised in the novel as the role played by the place she came from, and how that informs, and complicates, who she becomes. The novel seeks to explore the fundamental contradictions in doing so, through Meg's increasing awareness that the academy is not the harmonious, class aware institution she has idealised, but a world driven by status and hierarchies. This realisation must be reconciled in the light of Meg's anxieties about her working-class background.
Meg's doctoral training at an elite university underscores her developing sense of what constitutes excellence and the role played by highly influential conservative institutions in maintaining social arrangements. As her academic career unfolds, the holding of a Cambridge PhD allows Meg opportunities to make change as certain privileges are afforded her by virtue of her Cambridge status. Yet it is this very notion that she seeks to challenge. Her growing passion for the State University of Victoria, an institution developed for the education of working-class people, informs her activism within the academy. Why are excellence and equity polarised? Why does the institution matter more than the scholarship? Why is so much practice within universities contrary to the values scholars often claim?
These questions are explored through the dynamics of academic working life as student and later as a teacher at a university with an explicit equity agenda.
The Start of the End (2003): The action commences on a late Friday after at SUV, when the Department of Communication &amp; Cultural Studies has just been advised of Meg's promotion to Associate Professor. This vignette sees the initial soiree and celebrations and allows Meg to reflect on her experience. As her colleagues and friends are congratulating her, a particular student comes looking for Meg. It is clear that Angela Watson needs course advice particularly from Meg. Their discussion seems a straightforward one on the face of it, but it underscores many things; that Meg has come the full circle in her academic life, and what it is that her journey has really been about. The route to professorial appointment is considered, as is the source of Meg's
 
greatest professional joy and fulfillment; is it scholarship, followed by leadership, in her discipline? It is knowing she has continued to speak and act to change the life chances of all students, wherever possible? Or is it the subtle distilling of both of these, along with the knowledge which emerges from the nexus of teaching and research. That scholarship, new knowledge, surely must be taking us somewhere specific in relation to others? The more we know, the more we can do...to what end? From this reflection, we see the action of the novel unfold. We return to this scene at the end of the novel, as Meg considers the trajectory of her life and its themes in her work. The novel ends as she is faced with the next challenge.
Arrival (1989): Acceptance sees Meg as she is attempting to transform her life and create a new one. She has just been advised of her admission to an undergraduate Bachelor of Education program, at the major Melbourne teachers' college. Meg shares her rented home with her high school best friend, Anna, and her fiance, Jason, who appears to be superfluous in her life. Meg is aware he is a partner for who she used to be. We see Meg in her job as a medical secretary and this allows the mapping of Meg's sense of her own world, as she travels between home and work. This first stage of seeking her aspiration- to be an English teacher-evolves. As Meg considers the meaning of what she is about to do and how she knows it is right. This involves a consideration of what work means in our lives and how this is different for jobs according to how they are classed. Her relationship with the life she has known, the person she has been, is changing and this change is represented through her relationship with Jason. Meg's first day at teachers' college demonstrates that she is in a constant, often painful, dialogue with herself. The difficulties she encounters in making sense of the relation between her two 'lives' are thrown into sharp relief. The preparation for college sees Meg interrogating herself about how she can be different. Her initial experiences at the College resonate with her highest expectations of the life that awaits her, of the multiple possibilities currently being authored for her. Her first attendance at classes offers the opportunity to try out some of those possibilities, to test them against those she meets and to map the ways she could discover to 'be'. There is much tension and fear, but also endless excitement and these conflicting emotional states parallel and marble each other. It is on this day that she meets Jennifer Wren, her first real friend at university, who offers so many challenges to Meg. Their friendship involves a constant exhausting shift of subject positions, which Meg is able to look back on with affection in years to come.
Going Bowling (1989): within a few weeks of commencing at university, Meg is socializing with some of her new friends, having neatly segmented her home and college lives. Meg has already realised that her friendships fall into separate groups; her friendship with Jennifer and the people Jennifer knows does not find its way into this group. They meet in the city to go bowling and have a meal. While Meg really enjoys these new people, already tensions are developing in relations between the group. Their unofficial leader, Rosemary Marshall, has a tendency to seek control and already resistance is showing. Rosemary particularly
 
does not like Jennifer. Meg is enjoying her flirtation with Pete Danville, whom she has assumed to be gay. His very flattering attention has already developed Meg's confidence and stoked her ego, which has eroded in her stagnating relationship with Jason. Rosie has developed a crush on Pete and seems to take the flirtation with Meg personally. Dynamics in the group become slightly uncomfortable but Meg has grown quickly fond of her new friends, especially flamboyant Marina, another whom Rosemary seems to dislike. The discussions which occur during their evening deepen both the relationships and the tensions between them and draw lines which will determine the outcome of their various friendships.
The Ball (1990): In the third year of her degree, much has happened to Meg. She is married to Jason, although she omits him from much of her psychic (and practical) life. Meg and her friends attend the Faculty's annual formal dinner dance. Meg has so far managed to balance the competitiveness which occurs between all of them, both academically and personally. The negotiation of her respective friendships with Jennifer and Marina requires a great deal of diplomacy; the subtext in this is very disturbing to Meg. What exactly is the conflict about? She can't be sure why they don't like each other; it could be Marina's smoking, or Jennifer's confidence to spare, but these things also annoy her, yet she does not fight with either girl as they do with each other. Rose has always insisted that the problem is Jennifer's private school background, but Marina went to a catholic girls' school, so what could the difference be? The ball is initially a happy occasion; the girls dress up and they dance and drink champagne together with the boys. But dynamics operating beneath the surface force their way up. Rosie is ready to force Pete to confront her continuing crush on him; Pete confronts Meg about their ongoing flirtation. Meg gives in and admits to herself for the first time that she does want to be with Pete. He is grown up and exciting and strong. He offers her something she has never had with Jason. Married less than a year, she pushes her husband out of her thoughts. The events of the ball force Meg to confront the differences between all her friends and the discomfort this affords everyone. Rosie's continued need for control over the group is acknowledged.
Future Present (1991): Meg lives in Carlton with Pete. This is the busiest year thus far in her academic career and the financial, academic and emotional pressure is showing. This vignette gives us the range of Meg's academic activities and the way her life has fallen since the events at the ball eight months earlier. We see Meg grappling with her own evaluation of the changes in her 'way of being'; trying on different ways of living that she has idealised and finding them just as wanting as the last. Meg faces some key existential questions in this vignette and seeks answers which she finally discovers only she can give. Her relationship with Pete, the values and goals they share (and don't share) are thrown into sharp relief and provide a touchstone for the clearer determination of Meg's aspiration and future. Her relationship with various female friends is also revisited and this offers insight into Meg's constant checking of herself against idealised female templates. There is a
 
crisis of identity and strength which constitutes an important fork in Meg's road.
Beyond (1992): Beyond sees Meg determinedly seeking ways she can progress towards her goal, while still constantly checking against herself that postgraduate study (let alone a scholarly life) is available to her. We accompany Meg as she seeks and locates the academic path she wants; this is the backdrop for her further psychic exploration of the women who intimidate yet fascinate her, particularly Heloise Waul, who is a significant influence through Meg's postgraduate career. The sites in which Meg's personal struggles manifest are highlighted in this vignette, particularly in terms of dress and cultural pursuit. The conversations between Meg and Heloise also allow an exploration of the feminist politics of that milieu and the class tensions which operate tacitly within those politics.
Bound to the Caucus (1992); Meg has now nearly completed her undergraduate degree and has been active for some time in university life and student politics. Her feminist and socialist education is well advanced. Bound to the Caucus shows us Meg in her student politics world for the first time, where the segue of her activism and academic life have taken her. Meg has found female friends who understand that part of her which struggles with inadequacy, although at this point in the novel this common struggle is not well understood or articulated. It is in this vignette that Meg admits her growing attraction for a Liberal student activist, Stuart Noble; this proscribed liaison raises many questions about values and aspiration, as well as the dominant sexual politics of the time and place. Bound to the Caucus also offers insight into the student activism occurring at universities like Philip in the early 1990s.
Divergence (1993): Set in 1993, Meg is now in the early weeks of her honours program, although she has been at work on her thesis on the poet William Blake for some months. Living unhappily in a share household near the University, her relationship with Stuart Noble continues to develop, reaching a crisis point in this period. These events occur in the context of Meg's activist career in the Student Left, particularly as she encounters issues of identity around her class, feminism and difference amongst Left women. While Meg fights these battles passionately in an intense milieu, she considers them emotionally in terms of her changing sense of herself. Meg is increasingly aware that the personal impact of her class is changing for her. Additionally, she explores her relation with a 'boyfriend' of right wing political affiliation; Meg comes to recognise that this relationship is undermining her sense of herself in a way that her relationships with women in the left previously did.
Honour Roll (1993): Meg is now undertaking honours and this vignette opens with Meg seeing the honours coordinator, Professor Michaela Moore, who approximates all those apparently middle-class traits to which Meg has such a push-pull relation. We see the return of a chapter of the honours thesis, discussion of the content and the constantly shifting subject positions these experiences
 
offer Meg. This vignette also directly introduces Agnes. Mia and Agnes meet Meg after her supervision and this conversation allows very distinct if tacit class themes to develop. Meg has warmed quickly to Agnes, who is unlike anyone she has known; they have much in common in relation to their work and this binds them. Mia continually presents a viewpoint which irritates Meg, in relation to entitlement: to academic life, to funding, even to questioning how these things are enabled. Honour Roll allows us to see Meg's flourishing theoretical and intellectual life and its role in assisting her emotionally as she re-frames the same conundrums that previously constituted obstacles.
The Cusp (1993): Meg's developing friendship with Agnes offers her enormous insights into difference and her developing sense of self and aspiration. While the girls come from diametrical backgrounds, they are united by their passion for their research and scholarly work. Meg is increasingly self-conscious through their discussions in terms of how she has seen herself and allowed herself to dream and seek. Cusp is set at the end of the honours year, prior to the release of results. Meg and Agnes explore their feelings about academia and this leads to discussions of purpose and the role of class within that. This vignette also documents Meg's growing social confidence and those aspects of herself which have become so sure to her, that she no longer considers them at all.
Whom (1996): [Not included in this abridged edition]. Set at
Cambridge, two thirds into Meg's doctorate, Whom shows Meg in the mental space which will take her back to Melbourne and the State University of Victoria. Having risen to the challenge of doctoral study, she is confronted now by deeper demons, and the need to explore and challenge them in the ambivalent context of Cambridge, which so excites her still, but which has proved empty of the profoundly held higher ideals she expected to see reflected. Set in the midst of Meg's doctoral study, this vignette is dramatically abridged in the submission novel. The importance of Whom lies in its concern with Meg's rapidly shifting sense of herself and her own scholarly subjectivity and the changes to these that the culture of Cambridge has wrought. By the second year of her PhD Meg is crystal clear about her goals and decides to spend the long break at home, rather than travelling, because she wishes to 'touch base' with her future. The action described segues into that in Courting the Enemy. Whom describes Meg's ambivalent and contradictory but passionate feelings about Cambridge. Whom demonstrates Meg's increasing anger at the status and privilege to which her education now automatically admits her, and her need to find some sort of stasis and safety in her emotional life. In this vignette, Meg meets her life partner, Jeremy McCallum (I have intentionally reduced the attention in the novel to Meg's romantic life as she matures into her career).
Courting the Enemy (late 1990s): By this time, Meg is a senior lecturer in English at the State University of Victoria, which was established in the nineteenth century as the Worker's College. This vignette starts with Meg's attendance at a University Committee
 
which is considering a transformation in relation to equity in admissions policy. Meg was drawn to SUV because of its transparent and determined commitment to educate the children of working-class people. An attack on the equity admission policy of her university galvanizes Meg and some of her colleagues. The action of the vignette considers the role of the scholar, and of such an institution as SUV, in the light of daily academic life. This vignette is primary in its demonstration of the themes of the novel. In the unabridged version, I took the opportunity to illustrate some of the vast range of administrative, intellectual and even physical demands on a senior scholar in the routine of academic life. In placing Meg in this context, I sought to highlight how a scholar of her values and commitment makes sense of the constantly shifting terrain of her working world and how this continually informs her practice. This vignette is also significant for its retrospective description of Meg's employment at SUV some years earlier.
Locus: (1995). This piece of writing stands apart from the rest of the novel. I wished to write in a reflective voice, which might be from Meg's journal, were it not in the (omniscient) third person, in order to consider the headspace and meaning-making which occurs as Meg settles into Cambridge, and the lifestyle her situation allows her. Locus is a deeper engagement with Meg's sense of her identity. It considers the impact on her of the physical journeys she must make to match those of her psyche. These are thoughts too personal for a letter, even to Anna. Meg is exploring her ever shifting self and the growth in her self-belief allows her to explore what is rage; that she was bounded by illusions about her worth. Locus seeks to allow some context for Meg's anger at the role Cambridge plays. I seek to create the space in which Meg's dawning self understanding will lead her to her next, driven, purpose.
Letters: throughout the novel letters are used to reveal and inform Meg's relationship with her family. This is an intentional device to distance the birth family in an attempt to blur and muddy an assessment of Meg's class through traditional measures. The letters between Meg and Aunty Jean particularly reveal much of the classed emotional antecedents of Meg's life. There are also letters exchanged with Meg's high school best friend, Anna, who has moved to the country and a very different lifestyle. Meg writes to Anna often, using the acceptance she feels in the friendship and her sense that Anna understands her, to touchstone her own emotional growth. Formal letters from institutions ring changes in settings and mark significant points in the geographical and academic trajectory of the character. All the letters serve to introduce time and event changes consistent with the episodic style of the narrative.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social classes</field><field name="subject">group identity</field><field name="subject">self</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050804.103618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A bibliographic survey of folklore in Australia 1790-1990</field><field name="creator">Hults, David Stilwill</field><field name="description">The study of folklore within Australia to date has been consistently hampered by the lack of any systematic and comprehensive subject bibliography available to researchers interested in the area.

Depending on location, form and function, these linear landscape elements include hedgerows, fencerows, shelterbelts, roadside or streamside strips and wildlife corridors. In many anthropogenically-modified landscapes, linear strips are important components for conservation because they provide a large proportion of the remaining wooded or shrubby habitat for fauna. They may also function to provide connectivity across the landscape. In some districts, the linear strips form an interconnected network of habitat.
The spatial configuration of remnant habitat (size, shape and arrangement) may influence habitat suitability, and hence survival, of many species of plant and animal in modified landscapes. Near Euroa in south-eastern Australia, the clearing and fragmentation of temperate woodlands for agriculture has been extensive and, at present, less than 5% tree cover remains, most of which (83%) occurs as linear strips along roads and streams. The remainder of the woodland occurs as relatively small patches and single isolated trees scattered across the landscape. As an assemblage, arboreal marsupials are woodland dependent and vary in their sensitivity to habitat loss and fragmentation.
This thesis focusses on determining the conservation status of arboreal marsupials in the linear network and understanding how they utilise the landscape mosaic. Specifically, the topics examined in this thesis are: (1) the composition of the arboreal marsupial assemblage in linear and non-linear woodland remnants; (2) the status and habitat preferences of species of arboreal marsupial within linear remnants; and (3) the ecology of a population of the Squirrel Glider Petaurus norfolcensis in the linear network, focusing on population dynamics, spatial organisation, and use of den trees.
The arboreal marsupial fauna in the linear network was diverse, and comprised seven out of eight species known to occur in the district. The species detected within the strips were P. norfolcensis, the Sugar Glider Petaurus breviceps, Common Brushtail Possum Trichosums vulpecula, Common Ringtail Possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus, Brush-tailed Phascogale Phascogale tapoatafa, Koala Phascolarctos cinereus and Yellow-footed Antechinus Antechinus flavipes. The species not detected was the Feathertail Glider Acrabates pygmaeus. Survey sites in linear remnants (strips of woodland along roads and streams) supported a similar richness and density of arboreal mammals to sites in non-linear remnants (large patches or continuous tracts of woodland nearby). Furthermore, the combined abundance of all species of arboreal marsupials was significantly greater in sites in the linear remnants than in the non-linear remnants. This initial phase of the study provided no evidence that linear woodland remnants support a degraded or impoverished arboreal marsupial fauna in comparison with the nonlinear remnants surveyed.
Intensive trapping of arboreal marsupials within a 15 km linear network between February 1997 and June 1998 showed that all species of arboreal marsupial (except A. pygmaeus) were present within the linear strips. Further analyses related trap-based abundance estimates to measures of habitat quality and landscape structure. Width of the linear habitat was significantly positively correlated with the combined abundance of all arboreal marsupials, as well as with the abundance of P. norfolcensis and T. vulpecula. The abundance of T. vulpecula was also significantly positively correlated with variation in overstorey species composition, Acacia density and the number of hollow-bearing trees. The abundance of P. norfolcensis was positively correlated with Acacia density and canopy width, and negatively correlated with distance to the nearest intersection with another linear remnant. No significant variables were identified to explain the abundance of P. tapoatafa, and there were insufficient captures of the remaining species to investigate habitat preferences.
Petaurus norfolcensis were resident within the linear network and their density (0.95 -1.54 ha-1) was equal to the maximum densities recorded for this species in continuous forest elsewhere in south-eastern Australia. Rates of reproduction were also similar to those in continuous forest, with births occurring between May and December, a mean natality rate of 1.9, and a mean litter size of 1.7. Sex ratios
never differed significantly from parity. Overall, the population dynamics of P. norfolcensis were comparable with published results for the species in contiguous forest, clearly suggesting that the linear remnants currently support a self-sustaining, viable population.
Fifty-one P. norfolcensis were fitted with radio transmitters and tracked intermittently between December 1997 and November 1998. Home ranges were small (1.3 - 2.8 ha), narrow (20 - 40 m) and elongated (322 - 839 m). Home ranges were mostly confined to the linear remnants, although 80% of gliders also utilised small clumps of adjacent woodland within farm paddocks for foraging or denning. Home range size was significantly larger at intersections between two or more linear remnants than within straight sections of linear remnants. Intersections appeared to be important sites for social interaction because the overlap of home ranges of members of adjacent social groups was significantly greater at intersections than straight sections. Intersections provided the only opportunity for members of three or more social groups to interact, while still maintaining their territories.
The 51 gliders were radiotracked to 143 different hollow-bearing trees on 2081 occasions. On average, gliders used 5.3 den trees during the study (range 1-15), and changed den trees every 4.9 days. The number of den trees used by each glider is likely to be conservative because the cumulative number of den trees continued to increase over the full duration of the study. When gliders shifted between den trees, the mean distance between consecutive den sites was 247 m. Den trees were located throughout a glider's home range, thereby reducing the need to return to a central den site and potentially minimising energy expenditure. Dens were usually located in large trees (mean diameter 88.5 cm) and were selected significantly more often than expected based on their occurrence within the landscape.
The overall conclusion of this thesis is that the linear network I studied provides high quality habitat for resident populations of arboreal marsupials. Important factors influencing the suitability of the linear remnants appear to be the high level of network connectivity, the location on soils of high nutrient status, the high density of large trees and an acacia understorey. In highly fragmented landscapes, linear habitats as part of the remaining woodland mosaic have the potential to be an integral component in the conservation of woodland-dependent fauna. The habitat value of linear strips of vegetation should not be underestimated.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phalangeridae</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Remnant vegetation</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050804.104814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">External public piano examinations in Malaysia: Social and symbolic significance.</field><field name="creator">Ross, Valerie</field><field name="description">The thesis investigated the social and symbolic significance of acquiring a 'music education' through the taking of piano tuition and external public music examinations. It aimed to discover why the learning of the piano and the certification of musical attainment are so prevalent and revered among Malaysian music students. Its purpose was to unravel the socio-cultural raison d'etre of this approach to music education through the creation of a metatheoretical schema, which is premised upon the theories of symbolic interactionist, George Herbert Mead, music analyst, Heinrich Schenker and social theorist, George Ritzer. Central to the argument in this instance is the symbolic significance associated with the act of playing the piano. The investigation attempted to determine if this 'act' conveyed a symbolic meaning that is peculiar to a specific cultural vista. It further examined the degree to which this practice represented both a validation and a sense of conformity to social norms in the continuity and stability of an expanding middle class society in Malaysia. The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) is the largest of the five main external public music examination boards that operate in Malaysia. Since 1948, over one million candidates have enrolled for ABRSM examinations in Malaysia and a team of approximately thirty ABRSM examiners visit Malaysia for three months every year. The majority of the candidates are pianists. Given such large numbers of piano candidates, one might expect a healthy development of musical talent in the country with aspiring pianists eager to demonstrate their musical prowess. However, this does not seem to be the case. On the contrary, there appears to be a curious lacuna between the growing number of students who enrol for external public music examinations and the seemingly lack of interest in public music making and the honing of general musicianship skills. The thesis hence examined the symbolic meaning of this socio-musicological phenomena.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music education</field><field name="subject">piano tuition</field><field name="subject">external public music</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">metatheoretical schema</field><field name="subject">social and symbolic interaction</field><field name="subject">George Herbert Mead</field><field name="subject">Heinrich Schenker</field><field name="subject">George Ritzer.</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050808.135747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's bodies, self-perception and physical acitivity:  A naturalistic study of women's participation in aerobics classes</field><field name="creator">Warrick, Rona Lee</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to describe the behaviour and perceptions of women in aerobic or exercise to music classes.

A naturalistic method of study was chosen in order to gain a comprehensive view of the subjective experience of aerobics participation.  Approximately fifty female health club members were observed over a three month period in order to identify and describe patterns of involvement, behaviour and perception and the factors affecting them.  Six groups of women were identified.  These were &#145;Naturals&#146;, &#145;Compulsive&#146;, &#145;Functional Feminist&#146;.  Several factors were observed as potentially contributing to the patterns observed.  These included attitude toward perceived cultural ideals and pressures of female expectation and shape, perceptions of aerobics and exercise, pre-occupation with slenderness and bodyshape, self-image and body image.  The relationship between these factors was found to be dynamic and reciprocal, with participation possibly intensifying or alternately reducing bodyshape concern.

The hopelessness theory of depression (Abramson, Metalsky, &amp; Alloy, 1989) particularly implicates stable and global attributions for negative events as influences upon depression. Positive event attributions are considered less influential, yet they have shown equal predictiveness to negative event attributions for depression-specific mood. Previous research has provided equivocal results largely because of cross-sectional design and modest psychometric properties of the measures. The present research aimed to: create a new instrument to measure optimistic and pessimistic attributions; test the relatedness of attributions for positive and negative events; and, clarify relationships of the scales with optimism and mood. Three studies were undertaken, all of which used structural equation modeling. Two cross-sectional studies, using 342 and 332 community participants respectively, developed and validated the Questionnaire of Explanatory Style (QES). A final longitudinal study with 250 community participants tested the predictive validity of the QES. Overall, six scales were developed, three of which were optimistic and three of which were negative. The scales were acceptable to community samples and had adequate psychometric properties. The optimistic scales were attributions for positive events and the negative scales were attributions for negative events rather than pessimistic scales. Cross-sectional results indicated that only one of the negative scales weakly directly predicted depression-specific mood, but all predicted general psychological distress. By contrast, the optimistic scales were more directly predictive of depression-specific mood, particularly the Positive Disposition scale. Longitudinal results indicated that two of the optimistic scales were the most important QES predictors of depression-specific mood two months later. The optimistic scale Positive Disposition appears most central to the prediction of both concurrent and subsequent depression-specific mood. The scale content represents explanations for positive events that are internal and stable characteristics. These may be construed as personal competencies to bring about positive outcomes. This scale is closely allied to measures of optimism. Findings affirm the importance of optimistic attributions to the understanding of depression-specific mood and provide a productive focus for therapeutic intervention and future research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">mental</field><field name="subject">optimism</field><field name="subject">self-perception</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.093235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prevention of body concerns and risk behaviours in adolescent boys.</field><field name="creator">Stanford, Jacqueline</field><field name="description">Overall, this thesis was designed to explore the nature of adolescent boys' body image, the effects of body image on body change strategies and psychological adjustment, and the factors that influence body image. The first study examined body image in 362 adolescent boys. Body image was considered in terms of attitudes to different body parts and attributes, including, lower, middle and upper body, as well as weight, shape and muscles. The relationships between Body Mass Index (BMI), body image, sociocultural messages, psychological adjustment and body change strategies, including strategies to decrease weight and increase muscles using food and exercise, drive for thinness, bulimic attitudes and behaviour, excessive exercise, food supplements to lose weight, increase muscles and steroids, were also investigated. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the role of body image, sociocultural messages and psychological adjustment to predict satisfaction with different body attributes and body change strategies. The findings from study one led to the development of a program aimed at preventing the development of unhealthy attitudes and behaviours among adolescent boys. Study two involved the implementation and evaluation of this prevention program. One hundred and twenty one boys participated in the program. The program was based on social-cognitive theory, and included a focus on accepting differences and the development of self-esteem. The boys who participated in the program indicated some change in existing attitudes and showed less development of risk behaviours relative to the control group. The implications of the findings from this thesis in relation to future research, as well as the prevention of adolescent boys' body image problems are discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Self-esteem</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">body image in adolescence</field><field name="subject">teenage boys</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">coping ability</field><field name="subject">life skills</field><field name="subject">community life</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.093958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The changing ideological basis of planning practice in Hanoi, Vietnam.</field><field name="creator">Ha, Van Que</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">city planning</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Hanoi</field><field name="subject">urban policy</field><field name="subject">cities and towns</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">changing ideology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.094855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in the Australian Commonwealth departmental machinery of government: 1928-1982</field><field name="creator">Castleman, Beverley Dawn</field><field name="description">The Commonwealth departmental machinery of government is changed by using Orders in Council to create, abolish or change the name of departments. Since 1906 governments have utilised a particular form of Order in Council, the Administrative Arrangements Order (AAO), as the means to reallocate functions between departments for administration. After 1928 successive governments from Scullin to Fraser gradually streamlined and increasingly used the formal processes for the executive to change departmental arrangements and the practical role of Parliament, in the process of change, virtually disappeared.
From 1929 to 1982, 105 separate departments were brought into being, as new departments or through merger, and 91 were abolished, following the merger of their functions in one way or another with other departments. These figures exclude 6 situations where the change was simply that of name alone. Several hundred less substantial transfers of responsibilities were also made between departments.
This dissertation describes, documents and analyses all these changes. The above changes can be distilled down to 79 events termed primary decisions. Measures of the magnitude of change arising from the decisions are developed with 157.25 units of change identified as occurring during the period, most being in the Whitlam and Fraser periods.
The reasons for the changes were assessed and classified as occurring for reasons of policy, administrative logic or cabinet comfort. 47.2% of the units of change were attributed to policy, 34.9% to administrative logic, 17% to cabinet comfort. Further conclusions are drawn from more detailed analysis of the change and the reasons for the changes.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil service</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Politics and government</field><field name="subject">Australian Government</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.095625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'...we are not competing with bigger papers - we are doing a different job': A study of country Australian news values.</field><field name="creator">Vine, Josie</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Journalism</field><field name="subject">rural Australia</field><field name="subject">mass media. criticism</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.100534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Science education in primary schools in a state of change.</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Coral</field><field name="description">Through a longitudinal study of one teacher's science teaching practice set in the context of her base school, this thesis records the effects of the structural and policy changes that have occurred in Victorian education over the past 6-7 years - the 'Kennett era'. Initially, the purpose of the study was to investigate the teacher's practice with the view to improving it. For this, an action research approach was adopted. Across the year 1998, the teacher undertook an innovative science program with two grades, documenting the approach and outcomes. Several other teachers were involved in the project and their personal observations and comments were to form part of the data. This research project was set in the context of a single primary school and case study methodology was used to document the broader situational and daily influences which affected the teacher's practice. It was apparent soon after starting the action research that there were factors which did not allow for the development of the project along the intended lines. By the end of the project, the teacher felt that the action research had been distorted - specifically there had been no opportunity for critical reflection. The collaborative nature of the project did not seem to work. The teacher started to wonder just what had gone wrong. It was only after a break from the school environment that the teacher-researcher had the opportunity to really reflect on what had been happening in her teaching practice. This reflection took into account the huge amount of data generated from the context of the school but essentially reflected on the massive number of changes that were occurring in all schools. Several issues began to emerge which directly affected teaching practice and determined whether teachers had the opportunity to be self-reflective. These issues were identified as changes in curriculum and the teaching role, increased workload, changed power relations and changed security/morale on the professional context.
This thesis investigates the structural and policy changes occurring in Victorian education by reference to documentation and the lived experiences of teachers. It studies how the emerging issues affect the practices of teachers, particularly the teacher-researcher. The case study has now evolved to take in the broader context of the policy and structural changes whilst the action research has expanded to look at the ability of a teacher to be self-reflective: a meta-action research perspective. In concluding, the teacher-researcher reflects on the significance of the research in light of the recent change in state government and the increased government importance placed on science education in the primary context.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education and state</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">science teachers</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">primary teaching</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.101333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of stresses imposed on macroinvertebrate communities in two urban streams.</field><field name="creator">Veenstra-Quah, Anneke Alison</field><field name="description">The aim of the project was to determine factors which explain the distribution of macroinvertebrates in two Melbourne streams both drastically affected by urbanisation. A detailed description is given of Dandenong Creek, flowing through the south-eastern suburbs, and Darebin Creek, in the northern suburbs, emphasising stream features likely, or known, to influence the drift and benthic fauna.
Faunal sampling was carried out in Dandenong Creek from June 1992 until July 1993, and in Darebin Creek from February 1995 until March 1998. Physicochemical parameters were also recorded. The collected data, together with previously existing data, were analysed using multivariate analyses: non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS); analysis of similarities (ANOSIM); matching biotic and abiotic variables using BIOENV, and principal component analysis (PCA). Various biotic and diversity indices were calculated in an attempt to identify the major factors responsible for the failure of the fauna to recover from previously more seriously degraded water quality.
The contribution of drift to the colonisation potential in Dandenong Creek appeared to be impacted by retarding basins, underground barrel-draining and channelization. Results also indicated that increased conductivity adversely affected the fauna in the lower reaches of Dandenong Creek. It was concluded that in Darebin Creek, high nutrient levels, as well as other pollutants, had resulted in low macroinvertebrate diversity in both the drift and benthos.
If, as this study suggests, faunal diversity is a valid measure of stream health, the following factors need to be addressed for catchment-wide, stream management: lack of riparian zone vegetation (increasing bank erosion and making the benthic habitat unstable, with greater temperature variability); control of stormwater runoff (flow variability, increased conductivity, nutrient levels, sediment loads, sewage effluent, industrial discharges and heavy metals), and to modify retarding basins to increase stream continuity.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stream ecology</field><field name="subject">Darebin Creek</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">freshwater invertebrates</field><field name="subject">dandenong creek</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.102219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigative interviewing of children with intellectual disabilities.</field><field name="creator">Agnew, Sarah Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This research was designed to examine two broad issues in relation to the investigative interviewing of children (aged 9 to 13 years) with mild and moderate intellectual disabilities. First, how do children with intellectual disabilities perform (relative to children matched for chronological and mental age) when recalling an event in response to various questions? Second, what question types and interview strategies do police officers and caregivers use to elicit accurate and detailed accounts about an event from children with intellectual disabilities? The rationale for exploring each of these issues was to determine possible ways of improving the elicitation of evidence from children with intellectual disabilities. While children with intellectual disabilities constitute a high proportion of all child victims of abuse (Conway, 1994; Goldman, 1994; Morse, et ah, 1970), they rarely provide formal reports of abuse and of those incidents that are reported, few cases progress to court (Henry &amp; Gudjonsson, 1999).
Study 1 used a standard interview protocol containing a variety of questions and an interview structure commonly used in investigative interviews. Specifically, the memory and suggestibility of eighty children with either a mild and moderate intellectual disability (M age = 10.85 years) was examined when recalling an innocuous event that was staged at their school. The children's performance was compared with that of two control groups; a group of mainstream children matched for mental age and a group of mainstream children matched for chronological age. Overall, this study showed that children with both mild and moderate intellectual disabilities can provide accurate and highly specific event-related information hi response to questions recommended in best-practice guidelines. However, their recall
 
was less complete and less clear in response to free-narrative prompts and less accurate in response to specific questions when compared to both mainstream age-matched groups.
Study 2 provided an in-depth analysis of the types of questions and strategies used by twenty-eight police officers and caregivers when interviewing children with either mild or moderate intellectual disabilities (M age = 11.13 years) about a repeated event that was staged at their school. The results revealed that while the approach used by the police officers was generally consistent with best-practice recommendations (i.e., their interviews contained few leading, coercive or negative strategies), there were many ways in which their approach could be improved. This study also showed that the caregivers used a high proportion of direct and negative strategies to elicit information from their children. Even when caregivers used open-ended questions, their children provided less event-related information than they did to police interviewers. The results of both studies were discussed in relation to current 'best-practice' guidelines for interviewing children and recommendations were offered for improving the quality of field interviews with children who have intellectual disabilities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">recollection</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">children with mental disabilities</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="subject">interviewing techniques</field><field name="subject">attachment behavior in children</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.103016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Workplace education and training: Are Tafe teachers prepared for their evolving roles?</field><field name="creator">Wakefield, Lynette Florence</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="subject">curricula</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">vocational education</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">business and education</field><field name="subject">occupational training</field><field name="subject">technical education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.103545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Agent-based hybrid framework for decision making on complex problems.</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Zili</field><field name="description">Electronic commerce and the Internet have created demand for automated systems that can make complex decisions utilizing information from multiple sources. Because the information is uncertain, dynamic, distributed, and heterogeneous in nature, these systems require a great diversity of intelligent techniques including expert systems, fuzzy logic, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. However, in complex decision making, many different components or sub-tasks are involved, each of which requires different types of processing. Thus multiple such techniques are required resulting in systems called hybrid intelligent systems. That is, hybrid solutions are crucial for complex problem solving and decision making. There is a growing demand for these systems in many areas including financial investment planning, engineering design, medical diagnosis, and cognitive simulation. However, the design and development of these systems is difficult because they have a large number of parts or components that have many interactions. From a multi-agent perspective, agents in multi-agent systems (MAS) are autonomous and can engage in flexible, high-level interactions. MASs are good at complex, dynamic interactions. Thus a multi-agent perspective is suitable for modeling, design, and construction of hybrid intelligent systems. The aim of this thesis is to develop an agent-based framework for constructing hybrid intelligent systems which are mainly used for complex problem solving and decision making.
Existing software development techniques (typically, object-oriented) are inadequate for modeling agent-based hybrid intelligent systems. There is a fundamental mismatch between the concepts used by object-oriented developers and the agent-oriented view. Although there are some agent-oriented methodologies such as the Gaia methodology, there is still no specifically tailored methodology available for analyzing and designing agent-based hybrid intelligent systems. To this end, a methodology is proposed, which is specifically tailored to the analysis and design of agent-based hybrid intelligent systems. The methodology consists of six models - role model, interaction model, agent model, skill model, knowledge model, and organizational model. This methodology differs from other agent-oriented methodologies in its skill and knowledge models. As good decisions and problem solutions are mainly based on adequate information, rich knowledge, and appropriate skills to use knowledge and information, these two models are of paramount importance in modeling complex problem solving and decision making.
Follow the methodology, an agent-based framework for hybrid intelligent system construction used in complex problem solving and decision making was developed. The framework has several crucial characteristics that differentiate this research from others. Four important issues relating to the framework are also investigated. These cover the building of an ontology for financial investment, matchmaking in middle agents, reasoning in problem solving and decision making, and decision aggregation in MASs. The thesis demonstrates how to build a domain-specific ontology and how to access it in a MAS by building a financial ontology. It is argued that the practical performance of service provider agents has a significant impact on the matchmaking outcomes of middle agents. It is proposed to consider service provider agents' track records in matchmaking. A way to provide initial values for the track records of service provider agents is also suggested. The concept of &#145;reasoning with multimedia information&#146; is introduced, and reasoning with still image information using symbolic projection theory is proposed. How to choose suitable aggregation operations is demonstrated through financial investment application and three approaches are proposed - the stationary agent approach, the token-passing approach, and the mobile agent approach to implementing decision aggregation in MASs. Based on the framework, a prototype was built and applied to financial investment planning. This prototype consists of one serving agent, one interface agent, one decision aggregation agent, one planning agent, four decision making agents, and five service provider agents. Experiments were conducted on the prototype. The experimental results show the framework is flexible, robust, and fully workable. All agents derived from the methodology exhibit their behaviors correctly as specified.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">expert systems</field><field name="subject">computer science</field><field name="subject">intelligent agents</field><field name="subject">computer software</field><field name="subject">decision support systems</field><field name="subject">complex problems</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.110726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extracting fingerprint features using textures.</field><field name="creator">Mackley, Joshua</field><field name="description">Personal identification of individuals is becoming increasingly adopted in society today. Due to the large number of electronic systems that require human identification, faster and more secure identification systems are pursued.
Biometrics is based upon the physical characteristics of individuals; of these the fingerprint is the most common as used within law enforcement. Fingerprint-based systems have been introduced into the society but have not been well received due to relatively high rejection rates and false acceptance rates. This limited acceptance of fingerprint identification systems requires new techniques to be investigated to improve this identification method and the acceptance of the technology within society. Electronic fingerprint identification provides a method of identifying an individual within seconds quickly and easily.
The fingerprint must be captured instantly to allow the system to identify the individual without any technical user interaction to simplify system operation. The performance of the entire system relies heavily on the quality of the original fingerprint image that is captured digitally. A single fingerprint scan for verification makes it easier for users accessing the system as it replaces the need to remember passwords or authorisation codes. The identification system comprises of several components to perform this function, which includes a fingerprint sensor, processor, feature extraction and verification algorithms. A compact texture feature extraction method will be implemented within an embedded microprocessor-based system for security, performance and cost effective production over currently available commercial fingerprint identification systems.
To perform these functions various software packages are available for developing programs for windows-based operating systems but must not constrain to a graphical user interface alone. MATLAB was the software package chosen for this thesis due to its strong mathematical library, data analysis and image analysis libraries and capability. MATLAB enables the complete fingerprint identification system to be developed and implemented within a PC environment and also to be exported at a later date directly to an embedded processing environment.
The nucleus of the fingerprint identification system is the feature extraction approach presented in this thesis that uses global texture information unlike traditional local information in minutiae-based identification methods. Commercial solid-state sensors such as the type selected for use in this thesis have a limited contact area with the fingertip and therefore only sample a limited portion of the fingerprint. This limits the number of minutiae that can be extracted from the fingerprint and as such limits the number of common singular points between two impressions of the same fingerprint. The application of texture feature extraction will be tested using variety of fingerprint images to determine the most appropriate format for use within the embedded system.
This thesis has focused on designing a fingerprint-based identification system that is highly expandable using the MATLAB environment. The main components that are defined within this thesis are the hardware design, image capture, image processing and feature extraction methods. Selection of the final system components for this electronic fingerprint identification system was determined by using specific criteria to yield the highest performance from an embedded processing environment.
These platforms are very cost effective and will allow fingerprint-based identification technology to be implemented in more commercial products that can benefit from the security and simplicity of a fingerprint identification system.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MATLAB</field><field name="subject">image processing</field><field name="subject">digital techniques</field><field name="subject">fingerprints</field><field name="subject">identification</field><field name="subject">automation</field><field name="subject">biometric identification</field><field name="subject">pattern recognition systems</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.111403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiochemicals in merino ewes: Field effects and chemical identification.</field><field name="creator">Meade, Brian J</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Merino sheep</field><field name="subject">ewes</field><field name="subject">pheromones</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">semiochemicals</field><field name="subject">sex recognition</field><field name="subject">zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.112723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using the Victorian curriculum and standards framework in music education.</field><field name="creator">Blyth, Andrew</field><field name="description">This research examines the usefulness of the Curriculum and Standards Framework as the basis for school music education in Victoria. The thesis consists of a folio of four short research tasks and a Dissertation that examine the question in different ways.
The first of the short research tasks uses document and discourse analysis to examine and critique the philosophies of music education and aesthetic education that inform the Curriculum and Standards Framework. The same techniques are used in the second research task to trace the adoption and dissemination of the philosophy of music education as aesthetic education in a range of curriculum documents from around Australia. These two tasks show how centralised curriculum development often produces abstract and impractical goals and strategies.
Research tasks three and four use interview and participant observation with teachers based in one Melbourne secondary school to illuminate the highly contextual nature of teaching practice. The theoretical formulations of learning presented in Victorian curriculum materials and policy documents is contrasted with the practical approaches that teachers take in developing educational programmes. These tasks show how school education is always developed in relation to students and resources and not according to abstract standards.
The Dissertation reports on a major research project with thirty-two experienced music teachers working in the northern metropolitan region of Melbourne. Interviews with both primary and secondary teachers sought to determine the extent to which the Curriculum and Standards Framework had impacted upon their classroom teaching practice. The research was guided by Grounded Theory (Glaser and Strauss 1967) principles and it showed that the Framework and the associated process of centralising curriculum production failed to deliver any measurable gains or changes in music education in schools.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School music</field><field name="subject">instruction and study</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">curriculum planning</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.114322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using competencies in human resource management: case studies in Australian companies.</field><field name="creator">Hoffmann, Terrence Martin</field><field name="description">This study investigated the use of competencies for human resource management in seven Australian companies. Despite advocacy for the use of competencies by Government Committees and Task Forces (For example Carmichael (1992), Mayer, (1992) and Karpin, 1995), and the existence of competency standards for eighty per cent of the Australian workforce, the competency approach has not been widely adopted. A review of the literature indicated that the term competency had several meanings with different implications for its use depending on the meaning. The study looked at how individuals have defined the term and applied the approach to human resource management practices.
Interviews were conducted with Human Resource and Training managers, and operative staff in companies using competencies. How they defined the term, described the rationale for using competencies, and applied competencies to selection, training, performance appraisal and remuneration were determined. Case studies were written for each company to describe their particular application of competencies.
Competencies were found to be defined in several ways by those interviewed. Some advantages of using competencies in human resource management applications were found. The amount of work involved in introducing the competency approach was described as a reason why competencies have not been more widely adopted.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personnel management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">Australian companies</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.114903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of hypervalent organotin complexes and organotin clusters.</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Hongjian</field><field name="description">(119)Sn, (31)P and (13)C variable temperature NMR spectroscopies have been used to examine the effective coordination spheres in solution of a series of hypervalent organotin(IV) dithiolate compounds RnSnXm(S-S)4-n-m where R = Ph, Me, nBu, tBu; X = Cl, Br; (S-S) = S2CNR'2, S2COR', S2P(OR')2 (R' = Me, Et, iPr) and n = 1, 2, 3; m = 0,1,2. Stereochemical nonrigidity is a common phenomenon found for these hypervalent compounds. On the basis of heteronuclear NMR data and X-ray crystallographic data, dynamic behaviors of these hypervalent compounds have been established.
The system of hypervalent organotin(IV) fluoride complexes has also been investigated by variable temperature heteronuclear NMR techniques. A series of monomeric pentacoordinate complexes [RnSnC1mF5-n-m]-(R = Ph, Me, nBu, tBu; n = 2, 3; m - 0, 1, 2, 3) and dimeric complexes [(Me3SnX)F(Me3SnX')]- (X = F, Cl; X' = F, Cl) and hexacoordinate complexes [RnSnClmF6-n.m]2- (R = Ph, Me, nBu; n = 1, 2; m = (X 1, 2, 3,4) are identified in solution. The fluoride is of higer affinite to tin than the chloride. The stereochemistry and dynamic behavior of these complexes in solution has been studied. Fluoride ion may induce phenyl group disproportionation of phenyhin(IV) compounds. It is also found that in pentacoordinate diorganotin complexes, such as [Ph2SnCl2F]- and [Ph2SnClF2]- fluorine can be less apicophilic than chlorine. Studies of stereochemistry and dynamic behavior of bi-functional Lewis acid bis(haloorganosiannes) have also been carried out. The bis(haloorganostannes) exhibit strong chelate ability towards halide, with high selectivity on fluoride, forming heterocyclic chelating rings, the stability of which depend on the ring size.
In further exploration of the Lewis acidity of organotin(IV) halides, complexation of organotin(IV) halides with bis(tertiary phosphinc) ligands has been studied by 119Sn and 31P NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The phenyl group disproportionation is often observed in the complexation reaction.
Furthermore, organotin(IV) clusters such as [(RSn)12O14(OH)6]Cl2-2H2O (R = iPr, nBu) have been successfully prepared by base hydrolysis of RSnCl3. These clusters contain 12 tin atoms in one molecule and the cores of the clusters are dications. Other organotin clusters such as [nBuSn(O)O2CCH3]6 and [(nBuSn(OH)O2PPh2)3][O2PPh2) are readily formed by reaction of the 12-tin-atom cluster with an appropriate acid. The reactivity of and interconversion between organotin(FV) clusters have also been studied.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dr Daines Dakternieks</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.121324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Employer satisfaction with employees with a disability.</field><field name="creator">Smith, Kaye M</field><field name="description">Previous research that addressed determents of employer satisfaction with employees with a disability (EWDs) mainly targeted employers&#146; perceptions of workplace performance.  This thesis used quantitative and qualitative approaches to examine perspectives of employers and disability employment service providers (DESPs) on the complex nature of employer satisfaction with EWDs within an ecological paradigm.  Three studies were undertaken.  The first analysed questionnaire ratings for 656 employers of workplace performance of EWDs.  Analyses found: (1) employers rated EWDs lower than non-disabled employees (NDEs) on employer satisfaction and work performance; (2) determinants of employer satisfaction differed between EWDs and NDEs; (3) employers were more satisfied with EWDs than NDEs in relation to work performance; (4) lower comparative ratings on employer satisfaction for EWDs influenced future employment intentions toward people with a disability; (5) employers&#146; perceptions of job-match affected ratings on employer satisfaction and performance; (6) effects of job-match on employer satisfaction were direct and indirect, through work performance; and (7) variables representing job-match were relatively more important to employers&#146; decisions to hire and retain a person with a disability than variables representing Social Concerns and employer/management items.  A theoretical model that depicted the influence of processes (job-match) and outcomes (work performance) on employer satisfaction with EWDs was supported.  The second study analysed questionnaire ratings from 36 non-employers of EWDs.  Findings indicated very similar responses between employers and non-employers of EWDs on experiences related to employer satisfaction with NDEs.  Views about the relative importance of variable related to hiring and retaining a person with a disability suggested that generalising findings from the first study to all employers was reasonable.  The third study analysed data from interviews with 50 employers and 40 DESPs; and questionnaire responses for 56 DESPs and 36 non-employers of EWDs.  This study validated the importance of job-match to successful employment outcomes; suggesting DESPs were undervaluing their services to the employers.  The study also showed that Bronfenbrenner&#146;s Ecological Systems Theory provided a relevant framework with which to interpret complex information from different stakeholders, important to understanding employer satisfaction.  In summary, employer satisfaction was shown to be a relative concept that varied with referent, and a developmental phenomenon that was influences by many factors operating and interacting at a number of ecological levels.  Policies and practices to promote employer satisfaction with EWDs need co-ordinated approaches that recognise the influence of contexts internal and external to the workplace and the dynamic nature and interrelationships of characteristics within these contexts.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">people with disabilities</field><field name="subject">employement</field><field name="subject">employer attitude surveys</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.160034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The contribution of Multi-tenure reserve networks to biodiversity conservation.</field><field name="creator">Fitzsimons, James Andrew</field><field name="description">A consistent and integrated approach to nature conservation across the landscape and regardless of tenure is widely recognised as essential in ensuring the effective conservation of biodiversity. 'Multi-tenure reserve networks', which incorporate public and private lands managed for conservation, are considered a means of achieving landscape scale conservation. Biosphere Reserves (BR) and Conservation Management Networks (CMN) are characteristic models in Australia. This thesis aims to evaluate the role of such networks in protecting biodiversity, specifically by: (1) analysing the spatial configuration (size, shape, connectivity) of networks and their individual components; (2) evaluating the contribution of networks (in real terms and in reporting procedures) to biodiversity conservation objectives; (3) analysing the influence of the attitudes and perceptions of land managers on the functionality of networks; and (4) evaluating the influence of coordinating bodies on network functionality. In order to account for deficiencies in existing classifications of conservation lands, a new classification system was developed for this thesis - the Conservation Lands Classification. This classification incorporates conservation mechanisms on public and private lands and forms the basis for comparing network components in three Australian case studies - the Bookmark BR located in the Murray Mallee of South Australia, the Gippsland Plains CMN on the eastern Gippsland Plains of Victoria and the Grassy Box Woodlands CMN across the inland slopes of New South Wales. The spatial configuration of individual components within networks was measured using spatial analysis techniques within a geographic information system (GIS). GIS was also used to measure the contribution that networks made to a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system through the ecosystems they protected. The attitudes and perceptions of landowners and managers within the networks were obtained using questionnaires. Questionnaires were also sent to network coordinators. Statistical and descriptive analysis was conducted on the results. The sizes of individual components varied markedly between the three networks, however within each network public reserves were on average larger than private conservation lands. Although levels of physical connectivity varied between networks, Bookmark BR and Gippsland Plains CMN showed greater similarity to each other than to the Grassy Box Woodlands CMN. The findings raise important questions about the real and perceived differences in the BR and CMN models. All networks, and particularly those components outside the public protected area estate, contributed to enhancing the protection of ecosystems unrepresented or under-represented in the reserve system, although the extent of this contribution varied between networks. Trade-offs between reserve design efficiency and a contribution to a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system were evident between networks. Bookmark BR was characterised by high connectivity, strong reserve design integrity but a lower contribution to protecting under-reserved ecosystems, whereas the opposite was evident in the Grassy Box Woodlands CMN. Over 88% of managers considered their involvement in multi-tenure reserve networks to be a positive or very positive experience. A lack of resources and time for management were considered major limitations of these networks. The majority (80%) of private land managers within networks were willing to be included in a national reserve system of conservation lands. This has important implications for the Australian National Reserve System, which currently incorporates mostly public land. The changing nature of the network coordination arrangements suggests an organic fluid evolution of network structures is likely, contrasting with the desire for legalistic and administrative rigidity promoted by government agencies. The thesis concludes that all the networks studied contribute in varying degrees to biodiversity conservation. The key factors influencing the current and potential contribution that such networks make are: (1) the aims, directions and restrictions set by or imposed upon the coordinating body; and (2) the biophysical nature of the surrounding bioregion and resultant historical land use and tenure pattern. Although the successful operation of such 'multi-tenure' networks ultimately relies on the willing participation of private landholders, ongoing institutional support is likely to be required for maintaining networks in the longer term. Considering networks are increasingly formed outside of the influence of government institutions, this presents a significant challenge for effective coordinated conservation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological diversity conservation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Wildlife conservation</field><field name="subject">National parks and reserves</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050817.103606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between workplace reform and workplace participation</field><field name="creator">Jones, Sandra</field><field name="description">This thesis sought to advance understanding of the politics of workplace reform, explaining the respective roles of management and employees and how they relate.
The literature on workplace reform usually argues that reform is predicated on greater workforce participation in managerial decisions. More specifically, different approaches to workplace reform can be aligned to different forms of participation. Thus quality management can be associated with direct forms of participation, institutional workplace reform may depend on representative forms, and best practice may require a combination of both.
This thesis uses empirical evidence to explore this alignment between the different approaches to workplace reform and forms of participation.
The period chosen for empirical study is approximately 1985-1992 - an era of rapid innovation in workplace reform for Australian manufacturing. Three workplaces were chosen for intensive study from automotive component manufacturers because that industry was itself a laboratory for workplace reform and also because these firms exemplified different approaches to competitiveness and reform.
Three approaches to workplace reform - quality management, institutional workplace reform, and best practice - were distinguished to capture the range of Australian practice at that time. Similarly two approaches to workplace participation were distinguished - direct and representative - to reflect the range of observable practices at that time and to represent competing philosophies. Direct participation illustrated an approach founded in managerial context of the political status quo, whilst representative forms were considered to permit a pluralist shift of power to enable employees to manage in place of management.
The three case studies depict companies sharing the competitive crisis of their industry. From this stems the impetus for workplace reform. At this point the firms diverged in their choice of competitive strategies for workplace reform.
The case studies reveal, at the superficial level, a match between the chosen approaches to workplace reform and forms of participation. Basically, quality management is associated with direct employee participation, institutional workplace reform with collective bargaining and representative consultative committees, and best practice with both. However when the implementation of reform and participation are examined this match becomes less significant. One firm, Auto Air, achieved highly effective outcomes in both reform and participation. Another firm, Auto Electrical, failed in both.
The thesis concluded that the relationship between forms of participation and reform is less significant than the effective implementation of policy. Unitarist or pluralist approaches to power distribution count less than managerial capacity to integrate successive reform initiatives and their commitment to workforce participation hi change.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational change</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">automobile supplied industry</field><field name="subject">workplace reform</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.091140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A clinical investigation of attachment theory and the manifestation of psychological disturbance</field><field name="creator">Holt, Kate Eloise</field><field name="description">The affectional bond that develops between caregiver and child during infancy can lead to the development of emotional distress and the manifestation of psychological disturbance if the relationship is severed and a sense of loss is experienced.

The secure or insecure attachment relationships developed influence the capacity to form affectional bonds in later life and may lead to the manifestation of psychological disturbance, such as depression.
The focus of this thesis is on four case studies of three children and one adolescent who have suffered negative early life experiences. Harrison is an 8 year old Koori boy who has suffered from maternal deprivation. Diana is a 10 year old girl who has a Mild Intellectual Disability and Epilepsy. The influence of second generational trauma on the caregiver-infant attachment relationship will also be explored in the case study of Diana. The third case study focuses on Melanie who is a 9 year old girl who has suffered from paternal sexual abuse and exhibits indiscriminate attachment relationships. Finally, the fourth case study focuses on Tammie who is a 16 year girl who exhibits depressive symptomatology which may have developed as a result of early insecure attachment relationships. The case studies are described with reference to attachment theory, the language and social deficits associated with negative early life experiences, and implications for therapeutic interventions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">eating disorders in children</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">body image in children</field><field name="subject">caregivers</field><field name="subject">emotional disabilities</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.093259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preventing weight and muscle concerns among preadolescents</field><field name="creator">Holt, Kate</field><field name="description">The high level of weight and shape concerns amongst preadolescent children has prompted interest in the development of prevention programs for this age group. In the 1990s weight and shape concerns were considered primarily an adolescent phenomenon.  However, prevention programs which have been designed with adolescent and adult populations have been found to show limited success. Some researchers have argued that programs which target preadolescent children are more likely to be effective than programs that target adolescents, as by adolescence many attitudes and behaviours have become entrenched so they may be more difficult to modify. On the other hand, children's weight and shape concerns are believed to be more malleable and amenable to change. To date there have been limited controlled studies implementing prevention programs designed to reduce weight and shape concerns with preadolescent populations.
The new study conducted as part of this thesis involves the development and implementation of the &#145;Everybody&#146; s Different, Nobody Else Is Me&#146; preadolescent prevention program.  The program was designed to address some of the methodological biases of past research and incorporate three risk factors, social comparisons, negative affect, and self-esteem, to reduce and/or prevent the development of weight and muscle concerns among children. These three risk factors have been found to be associated with weight and shape concerns of adolescents and adults, and there is also increasing evidence that they are important factors among children. Research also suggests that social comparisons, negative affect, and self-esteem are interrelated, which highlights the importance of targeting the variables in one program.
The new five session prevention initiative was implemented with 156 grade four children. Both the treatment and control conditions consisted of 78 children. Preliminary evidence from the new prevention initiative indicated that the program reduced muscle bulk and exercise (ie. An over-emphasis on exercise to lose weight rather than health promotion), and negative affect in the long term as assessed by the six month follow-up. At the six month follow-up, children in both the treatment and control conditions reported reduced negative affect, dieting, and muscle bulk and exercise scores and increased positive affect. Consistent with short term follow-up results, boys reported greater muscle bulk and exercise scores than girls at the six month follow-up. Girls, in both conditions, were also found to report greater positive affect than boys. These findings are discussed in relation to past research, and suggestions for future prevention initiatives are highlighted.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">eating disorders in children</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">body image in children</field><field name="subject">attachment behavior in children</field><field name="subject">weight and shape</field><field name="subject">preadolescence</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.094217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calculators, mathematics and young children: A study of six children using calculators as part of the mathematics curriculum during their first two years of school.</field><field name="creator">Dale, Joyce Margaret</field><field name="description">The thesis investigates the role a calculator can play in the developing number knowledge of three girls and three boys as part of their mathematics program, during their first two years at primary school. Random sampling was used initially to select six girls and six boys from the twenty-four children entering a 1993 prep class.  These twelve children were interviewed on entrance to school and based on the performance of the twelve children on the initial interview, a girl and a boy were chosen from the higher, middle and lower achievers to take part in the full study. The class teachers involved were previously participants in the &#145;Calculators in Primary Mathematics&#146; research program and were committed to the use of calculators in their mathematics program.
A case study approach using qualitative methods within the activity theory framework is used to collect relevant data and information, an analysis of five interviews with each child and observations of the children in forty-one classroom lessons provides comprehensive data on the children's developing number knowledge during the two years. The analysis questionnaires establishes each teacher's perceptions of the children's number learning at the beginning and end of each year, compares teacher expectations with children's actual performance for the year and compares curriculum expectations with children's actual performance. A teacher interview established reasons for changes in teaching style; teacher expectations; children's number learning; and was used to confirm my research findings.
An activity theory framework provides an appropriate means of co-coordinating perspectives within this research to enable a description of the child's number learning within a social environment. This framework allows for highlighting the mediation offered by the calculator supporting the children's number learning in the classroom.
Levels of children's developing number knowledge reached when working with a calculator and as a result of calculator use are mapped against the levels recommended in &#145;Mathematics in the National Curriculum&#146; (National Curriculum Council, December 1988), and the Curriculum and Standards Framework: Mathematics (Board of Studies 2000). Findings from this comparison illustrate that the six children's performance in number was enhanced when using a calculator and indicate that on-going development and understanding of number concepts occurred at levels of performance at least two years in advance of curriculum recommendations for the first two years of school.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">primary school</field><field name="subject">calculators</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">calculators in primary mathematics research program</field><field name="subject">mathematics in the national curriculum</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.095343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between analysis and insight in Madhyamika Buddhism (A logico psychological model)</field><field name="creator">Dean, Colin Leslie</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the relationship between analysis and insight in Prasarigika Madhyamika Buddhism. More specifically it asks whether analysis is a necessary and/or a sufficient condition for the generation of insight. The thesis is divided into six chapters which include an introduction, an appendix which outlines Prasangika and Svatantrika views regarding the syllogism (svatantra) and a conclusion. The remaining chapters seek to demonstrate that analysis for the Prasarigika and the Tibetan Geluk-ba school is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for the arising of insight.
Chapter one is an investigation of certain Western psychological theories which deal with the effects on the mind of cogitating upon contradictions. Though the psychological theories are only suggestive, this chapter will lend support to the claim a) of the Prasaiigika, that analysis generates an altered state of consciousness; and b) that analysis may be a necessary and sufficient condition for the generation of insight.
Chapter two seeks to construct a logico-psychological model of how insight is generated. In this model it is argued that insight is a conceptual and intuitive experience: i.e. non-inferential, and that all thought comes via the intuition. This model argues that analysis is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for the generation of insight.
In chapter three an investigation of the writings of Dzong-ka-ba (Tsong-Kha-pa) is undertaken in order to ascertain how the Tibetan Geluk-ba (dGe lugs pa) school regard the relationship between analysis and insight. The model of chapter two will be compared with the Tibetan Geluk-ba accounts to gauge its explanatory power and correspondence with the Geluk-ba views.
Chapter four is an investigation of the writings of certain Western scholars. This investigation seeks to ascertain how these scholars may have regarded the relationship between analysis and insight. The chapter then compares these views with the model developed in chapter two.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prasangika Madhyamika</field><field name="subject">buddhism</field><field name="subject">insight</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.100146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virulence determinants of infectious bursal disease virus</field><field name="creator">Rudd, Matthew Francis</field><field name="description">The very virulent (vv) pathotype of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) has spread rapidly throughout Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Although Australia is currently unaffected, there remains the potential for incursion of an exotic isolate. The aim of this study was to identify putative virulence determinants of IBDV to facilitate the development of improved diagnostic assays for detection and characterisation of vvIBDV isolates.
Sequencing of Indonesian vvIBDV Tasik94 revealed a unique substitution 
[ A&#129;&#168;S222] in the hypervariable region (HVR) of viral protein (VP) VP2, which did not appear to impinge on virulence or antigenicity. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that Tasik94 was closely related to Asian and European vvIBDV strains. Extensive alignment of deduced protein sequences across the HVR of VP2 identified residuesI242 I256 and I294 as putative markers of the vv phcnotype.
Comparison of the pathology induced by mildly-virulent Australian IBDV 002/73 and Indonesian vvIBDV Tasik94, revealed that histological lesions in the spleen, thymus and bone marrow were restricted to Tasik94-infected birds, suggesting the enhanced pathogenicity of vvIBDV might be attributed to replication in non-bursal lymphoid organs.
The biological significance of the VP2 HVR in virulence was assessed using recombinant viruses generated by reverse genetics. Both genomic segments of Australian IBDV 002/73, and recombinant segment A constructs in which the HVR of 002/73 was replaced with the corresponding region of either tissue culture-adapted virus or vvIBDV (Tasik94), were cloned behind T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequences. In vitro transcription/translation of each construct resulted in expression of viral proteins. Co-transfection of synthetic RNA transcripts initiated replication of both tissue culture-adapted parental and recombinant viruses, however attempts to rescue non-adapted viruses in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were unsuccessful.
Nucleotide sequence variation in the HVR of VP2 was exploited for the development of a new diagnostic assay to rapidly detect exotic IBDV isolates, including vvIBDV, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification and Bmrl restriction enzyme digestion. The assay was capable of differentiating between endemic and exotic IBDV in 96% of 105 isolates sequenced to date.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular virology</field><field name="subject">poultry diseases</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="subject">poultry</field><field name="subject">viral disease</field><field name="subject">IBDV virus</field><field name="subject">vvIBDV Tasik94</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.103742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lesbians' experiences of menopause</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Jennifer Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the menopausal experiences of a non-clinical sample of lesbians living in Australia. Research on menopause to date has largely been conducted from a medicalised and heterosexual perspective: thus lesbians&#146; experiences remain unknown and invisible. Using a qualitative feminist multiple method research methodology combining content analysis and questionnaire/interview research, two hundred questionnaires were posted upon request to self-identified lesbians living in every Australian state and territory. Follow up in-depth interviews were conducted with twenty lesbians. Responses were grouped into four major themes: body image, sex and sexuality, hormone replacement therapy and health services and homophobia.
The findings show that lesbians at menopause face some different and additional issues from those experienced by heterosexual midlife women. For many of the study participants, commonly discussed concerns at menopause such as weight gain and other physical signs of ageing, decreased fertility, lack of libido, sexual difficulties and hormone replacement therapy were of little relevance and importance. Lesbians in this study frequently raised other issues such as the universal assumption of heterosexuality and homophobia experienced when interacting with health professionals, which led to less than satisfactory health care and reinforced feelings of invisibility.
In the Conclusion I argue that the study participants' views and experiences challenge negative, stereotypical views of both lesbians and menopause. The data thus add a new dimension to the presently narrow, heterosexist and medicalised view of women at midlife and contribute new knowledge to the body of literature on menopause. This thesis is a first important step in recording the experiences of lesbians regarding menopause in Australia. I include recommendations for further research in the area of lesbian health and improved practice, and discuss old and new obstacles lesbians face in a heteropatriarchal society in which lesbians continue to be invisible.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">menopause</field><field name="subject">lesbians</field><field name="subject">middle aged women</field><field name="subject">health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.105816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liver fat metabolism, obesity and diabetes in Psammomys Obesus</field><field name="creator">Lewandowski, Paul</field><field name="description">Defects in fat metabolism are central to the aetiology and pathogenesis of obesity and type II diabetes. The liver plays a central role in these disease states via its regulation of glucose and fat metabolism. In addition, accumulation of fat within the liver has been associated with changes in key pathways of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. However a number of questions remain. It is hypothesised that fat accumulation within the liver is a primary defect in the aetiology and pathogenesis of obesity and type II diabetes. Fat accumulating in the liver is the result of changes in the gene expression of key enzymes and proteins involved with fat uptake, fat transport, fat oxidation, fat re-esterification or storage and export of fat from the liver and these changes are regulated by key lipid responsive transcription factors.
To study these questions Psammomys obesus was utilised. This polygenic rodent model of obesity and type II diabetes develops obesity and diabetes in a similar pattern to susceptible human populations. In addition dietary and environmental changes to Psammomys obesus were employed to create different states of energy balance, which allowed the regulation of liver fat gene expression to be examined. These investigations include: 1) Measurement of fat accumulation and fatty acid binding proteins in lean, obese and diabetic Psammomys obesus. 2) Characterisation of hepatic lipid enzymes, transport protein and lipid responsive transcription factor gene expression in lean, obese and diabetic Paammomys obesus. 3) The effect of acute and chronic energy restriction on hepatic lipid metabolism in Psammomys obesus. 4) The effect of sucrose feeding on the development of obesity and type II diabetes in Psammomys obesus. 5) The effect of nicotine treatment in lean and obese Psammomys obesus, 6) The effect of high dose leptin administration on hepatic fat metabolism in Psammomys obesus.
The results of these studies demonstrated that fat accumulation within the liver was not a primary defect in the aetiology and pathogenesis of obesity and type II diabetes. Fat accumulating in the liver was not the result of changes in the gene expression of key enzymes and proteins involved in hepatic fat metabolism. However changes in the
mRNA level of the transcription factors PPAR&#8733; and SREBP-1C was associated with
the development of diabetes and the gene expression of these two transcription factors was associated with changes in diabetic status.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">etiology</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">liver</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">Psammomys Obesus</field><field name="subject">liver fat</field><field name="subject">aetiology</field><field name="subject">pathogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.111432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A physical theory of organisation and consequent neural model of spatio-temporal pattern acquisition</field><field name="creator">Brook, Sapoty</field><field name="description">A neurone model (the FORMON) is proposed which provides a mathematical explanation for a range of psychological phenomena and has potential in Artificial Intelligence applications. A general definition of organisation in terms of entropy and information is formulated. The concept of microcodes is introduced to describe the physical nature of organisation.
Spatio-temporal pattern acquisition and processing functions attributable to individual neurones are reviewed. The criterion for self-organisation in a neurone is determined as the maximisation of mutual organisation. A feedback control system is proposed to satisfy this criterion and provide an integrated long-term memory of spatio-temporal pattern. This pattern acquisition system is shown to be applicable to dendritic pattern recognition and axonal pattern generation. Provision is also made for adaptation, short-term memory and operant learning.
An electro-chemical model of transmission and processing of neural signals is outlined to provide the pattern acquisition functions of the Formon model. A transverse magnetic mode of electrotonic propagation is postulated in addition to the transverse electromagnetic mode.
Configurations of the Formon are categorised in terms of possible pattern processing functions.

The White-browed Treecreeper inhabits semi-arid woodlands in north-west Victoria, Australia, a vegetation community that has undergone extreme modification in the last century due to the expansion of agriculture in the region. Extant woodlands represent only 10% of the original woodland cover in the region, and are highly fragmented and disturbed in many districts. Thus, the survival of the White-browed Treecreeper may depend on active management. However, current knowledge of the ecology and biology of this species is virtually non-existent, and inadequate for informed and effective conservation actions. The aim of this thesis is to redress this situation and provide the ecological basis for sound conservation management of the species. The thesis consists of two parts: an investigation of habitat use at three spatial scales and a study of the social organization, nesting requirements, breeding behaviour and reproductive success of a population of White-browed Treecreepers.
Fifty-six patches of remnant woodland in north-west Victoria were surveyed to determine the factors affecting the occurrence of the White-browed Treecreeper at the regional scale. It was detected in 16 patches, and was largely confined to two core districts - Yarrara and, Wyperfeld (Pine Plains). The floristic composition of the dominant tree species was an important determinant of patch occupancy, with the results providing quantitative support for the previously suspected affinity for Belah Casuarina pauper and Slender Cypress-pine Callitris gracilis &#151; Buloke Allocasuarina luehmannii woodlands. However, the absence of the White-browed Treecreeper from several districts was due to factors other than a lack of appropriate habitat. Demographic isolation - the distance from the focal patch to the nearest population of the White-browed Treecreeper - was the most important variable in explaining variation in patch occupancy. Patches isolated from other treecreeper populations by more than 8.3 km in landscapes of non-preferred native vegetation, and 3 km in agricultural landscapes, were unlikely to support the White-browed Treecreeper. The impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on the capacity of individuals to move through the landscape (i.e. functional connectivity) is considered in relation to disruption to dispersal and migration, and the potential collapse of local metapopulations.
 
Habitat use was then examined in a network of patches and linear strips of Belah woodland embedded in a predominantly cultivated landscape. A minimum area of 18.5 ha of Belah woodland was identified as the most important criterion for patch occupancy at the local scale. This landscape appeared to be permeable to movement by the White-browed Treecreeper, facilitated by the extensive network of linear habitat, and clusters of small to medium fragments.
The third scale of habitat use investigated the frequency of use of 1-ha plots within tracts of occupied woodland. It is important to discriminate between habitat traits that operate at the population level, and those that act as proximate cues for habitat selection by individuals. Woodlands that have high tree density, extensive cover of low-stature shrubs, abundant lichen, a complex vertical structure, and relatively low cover of grass and herbs are likely to support larger populations of the White-browed Treecreeper. However, individuals appeared to be using tree dominance (positive) and tall shrub cover (negative) as proximate environmental stimuli for habitat selectivity. A relatively high cover of ground lichen, which probably reflects a ground layer with low disturbance and high structural complexity, was also a reliable indicator of habitat use. Predictive models were developed which could be used to plan vegetation management to enhance habitat for the White-browed Treecreeper. The results of the regional, landscape and patch-scale investigations emphasise that factors operating at multiple spatial scales influence the suitability of remnant vegetation as habitat for the White-browed Treecreeper.
The White-browed Treecreeper is typical of many small Australian passerines in that it has high annual survival, small clutches, a long breeding season, multiple broods and relatively low reproductive rates. Reproductive effort is adjusted through the number of clutches laid rather than clutch size. They occupy relatively large, all-purpose territories throughout the year. However, unlike many group territorial birds, territory size was not related to the number of occupants.
The White-browed Treecreeper nests in tree hollows. They select hollows with a southerly orientation where possible, and prefer hollows that were higher from the ground. At Yarrara, there was considerable spatial variation in hollow abundance that, in concert with territorial constraints, restricted the actual availability of hollows to less than the absolute abundance of hollows. Thus, the availability of suitable hollows may limit reproductive productivity in some territories, although the
 
magnitude of this constraint on overall population growth is predicted to be small. However, lack of recruitment of hollow-bearing trees would increase the potential for hollow availability to limit population growth. This prospect is particularly relevant in grazed remnants and those outside the reserve system.
Facultative cooperative breeding was confirmed, with groups formed through male philopatry. Consequently, natal dispersal is female-biased, although there was no skew in the sex ratio of the fledglings or the general adult population. Helpers were observed performing all activities associated with parenting except copulation and brooding. Cooperatively breeding groups enjoyed higher fledgling productivity than simple pairs, after statistically accounting for territory and parental quality. However, the difference reflected increased productivity in the 1999-breeding season only, when climatic conditions were more favourable than in 1998. Breeding commenced earlier in 1999, and all breeding units were more likely to attempt a second brood. However, only breeders with helpers were successful in fledging second brood young, and it was this difference that accounted for the overall discrepancy in productivity. The key mechanism for increased success in cooperative groups was a reduction hi the interval between first and second broods, facilitated by compensatory reductions in the level of care to the first brood. Thus, females with helpers probably achieved significant energetic savings during this period, which enabled them to re-lay sooner. Furthermore, they were able to recommence nesting when the fledglings from the first brood were younger because there were more adults to feed the dependent juveniles.
The current utility, and possible evolutionary pathways, of cooperative breeding is examined from the perspective of both breeders and helpers. Breeders benefit through enhanced fledgling productivity in good breeding conditions and a reduction in the burden of parental care, which may impart significant energetic savings. Further, breeders may facilitate philopatry as a means for ensuring a minimum level of reproductive success. Helpers benefit through an increase in their inclusive fitness in the absence of opportunities for independent breeding (i.e. ecological constraints) and access to breeding vacancies in the natal or adjacent territories (i.e. benefits of philopatry). However, the majority of breeding unit-years comprised unassisted breeders, which suggests that pairs are selectively favoured under certain environmental or demographic conditions.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creepers</field><field name="subject">birds</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">wildlife</field><field name="subject">white-browed treecreeper</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.122602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investing in intelligence : An inquiry into educational paradigm change</field><field name="creator">Seaton, Andrew</field><field name="description">In this philosophical and practical-critical inquiry, I address two significant and closely related problems - whether and how those involved in the enterprise of education conceptualise a need for educational change, and the observed resistance of school cultures to change efforts. I address the apparent lack of a clear, coherent and viable theory of learning, agency and change, capable of making explicit the need, substantive nature and means of educational change.
Based on a meta-analysis of numerous theories and perspectives on human knowing, learning, intelligence, agency and change, I synthesise a 'Dynamic Paradigm of Learning and Change', characterised by fifteen Constructs. I argue that this more viable Paradigm is capable of informing both design and critique of systemic curriculum and assessment policies, school organisation and planning models, professional learning and pedagogical practice, and student learning and action.
The Dynamic Paradigm of Learning and Change contrasts with the assumptions reflected in the prevailing culture of institutionalised education, and I argue that dominant views of knowledge and human agency are both theoretically and practically non-viable and unsustainable. I argue that the prevailing culture and experience of schooling contributes to the formation of assumptions, identities, dispositions and orientations to the world characterised by alienation.
The Dynamic Paradigm of Learning and Change also contrasts with the assumptions reflected in some educational reform efforts recently promoted at system level in Queensland, Australia. I use the Dynamic Paradigm as the reference point for a formal critique of two influential reform programs, Authentic Pedagogy and the New Basics Project, identifying significant limitations in both the conceptualisation of educational ends and means, and the implementation of these reform agendas.
 
Within the Dynamic Paradigm of Learning and Change, knowledge and learning serve the individual's need for more adaptive or viable functioning in the world. I argue that students' attainment of knowledge of major ways in which others in our culture organise experience (interpret the world) is a legitimate goal of schooling. However, it is more viable to think of the primary function of schooling as providing for the young inspiration, opportunities and support for purposeful doing, and for assisting them in understanding the processes of 'action scheme' change to make such doing more viable. Through the practical-critical components of the inquiry, undertaken in the context of the ferment of pedagogical and curricular discussion and exploration in Queensland between 1999 and 2003, I develop the Key Abilities Model and associated guidelines and resources relating to forms of pedagogy, curriculum organisation and assessment consistent with the Dynamic Paradigm of Learning and Change.
I argue the importance of showing teachers why and how their existing visions and conceptions of learning and teaching may be inadequate, and of emphasising teachers' conceptions of learning, knowing, agency and teaching, and their identities, dispositions and orientations to the world, as things that might need to change, in order to realise the intent of educational change focused on transformational student outcomes serving both the individual and collective good.
A recommendation is made for implementation and research of a school-based trial of the Key Abilities Model, informed by and reflecting the Dynamic Paradigm of Learning and Change, as an important investment in the development and expression of &#145;authentic' human intelligence.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">aims and objectives</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">educational paradigm</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.132538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of powerful owls (Ninox strenua) in contrasting habitats of the Yarra Valley Corridor, Victoria, Australia</field><field name="creator">Cooke, Raylene</field><field name="description">In this research I investigated ecological attributes of Powerful Owls (Ninox strenua) in a continuum of habitats throughout the Yarra Valley corridor of Victoria, Australia. These habitats ranged from a highly urbanized parkland (the Yarra Valley Metropolitan Park) to a relatively undisturbed closed forest (Toolangi State Forest).
Different aspects of the owls' ecology were investigated at six sites to determine whether their behaviour changed when they occupied habitats with different levels of urbanization and disturbance.
The ecological attributes investigated were habitat utilization and habitat requirements (for both roosting and nesting), adult behaviour (through radio-tracking), juvenile behaviour and dispersal (through radio tracking), diet (through analysing regurgitated food pellets) and breeding success rates. A number of methods were used to capture adult Powerful Owls. These are described and their effectiveness discussed. The types of radio-transmitters and colour bands used for identification of owls are also described.
The results showed that Powerful Owls are present and successfully breed in urban and suburban areas and that they can tolerate moderate levels of disturbance. However, Powerful Owls do require sites with high prey densities, roost trees and trees with suitable breeding hollows. In comparison with Powerful Owls living elsewhere in forests, the urban owls displayed higher tolerance levels to disturbance and were less selective in terms of habitat usage and diet. Home range sizes of urban
 
Powerful Owls also appeared much smaller than those of the forest-dwelling Powerful Owls. This is probably due to the high prey densities in the urban areas.
The ecology of the Powerful Owl is compared with that of two owl species from North America, the Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurind) and the Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus). In particular, I compared the similarities and differences in habitat requirements and breeding successes in different habitats for the three species.
Overall, it would appear that urban areas can support Powerful Owls providing some old-growth trees are maintained to provide nest hollows. Implications for the long-term management of Powerful Owls in urban areas are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">owls</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Yarra Valley</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">corridors</field><field name="subject">Powerful owl</field><field name="subject">ninox strenua</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.133845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Healthy markets - Heathly people?

Are such policies really appropriate to developing countries? Has a consensus now emerged in relation to international health policy? Has a new health care &#145;model&#146; appeared? The study of health care reform in Cambodia is a timely opportunity to investigate the implementation of health care reform under extreme conditions. These conditions include a legacy of genocide, long-term conflict, political isolation, and economic transition. This case study uses both qualitative and quantitative methods and multiple sources of data to analyse the reform program. The study reinforces the conclusion that, under conditions of extreme poverty, market based reforms are likely to have limited positive impact. Rather, understanding the cultural conditions that determine demand, delivering health care of a satisfactory quality, providing appropriate incentives for health practitioners, and supporting services with adequate public funding are the prerequisites for improved service delivery and utilisation. Cambodia's strategy of integrated district health service development and universal population coverage may provide an instructive example of reform. Emerging policy issues identified by this case study include the fundamental role of equity in service provision, the influence of the social determinants of health and illness and interest in the appropriate use of evidence in international health policy-making.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">Cambodia</field><field name="subject">administration</field><field name="subject">health care reform</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.134836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of ovarian development in the Yabby (Cherax destructor)</field><field name="creator">McRae, Thomas Geoffrey</field><field name="description">A study under controlled conditions of ovarian development and rematuration in the yabby (Cherax destructot) was undertaken.  The purpose of the study was to improve fundamental understanding of the reproductive biology of the species and provide a basis for application to hatchery management in culture.
A review was made of the current status of yabby culture in Australia and the present understanding of reproductive biology of decapod Crustacea.  The review emphasised factors controlling several aspects of ovarian development, in particular the processes of vitellogenesis. The subsequent study was designed within the context of current hatchery practice and was based on existing knowledge of decapod reproduction,
The sexual differentiation of the yabby after hatching was investigated by serial histological sections, and experiments were carried out to investigate the possibility of sex reversal of males. Most of this Investigation was concerned with removing the influence of the androgenic gland in directing male development, with the intent of observing the development of the elementary gonadal tissue into ovary. It was found that in contrast to other crustacean species, the sex of the yabby becomes fixed before the development of external secondary sexual characteristics, and before the androgenic gland can be discerned. Ovarian tissue developed in females at less than 8 weeks after hatching. A preliminary examination was undertaken for feminising parasites in gonadal tissue of a hermaphrodite yabby.
Investigation of the ovary after spawning demonstrated that whilst the female was held under constant conditions of temperature and photoperiod, little rematuration occurred. Except for generation of previtellogenic oocytes during the first two days, the gonaciosomatic index remained low for up to 5 months after spawning. If the temperature of the female was reduced to 10&#176;C and maintained constant, the previtellogenic oocytes were partially resorbed over a three week period. Rematuration then commenced, albeit at a low rate because of the reduced temperature,
A method for standardising gonadosomatic indices was developed which took into account differences in hepatopancreatic nutrient reserves of individuals and loss of one
 
or more appendages. This part of the study also considered constraints to rematuration and developed a method of accounting for differences in the ability of females to remature after spawning.
Experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of crowding and temperature manipulation on initiating ovarian rematuration and to determine the rate of rematuration at 22&#176;C once initiated. The duration of low temperature had no effect on rematuration; an overnight cooling was sufficient to initiate the process, Rematuration to the end of stage 2 vltellogenesis was substantially complete within 10 days. Crowding of females suppressed rematuration, but less than ideal water quality was not found to have any effect. The presence of a male initiated rematuration at a similar rate, but also led to stage 3 vitetlogenesis and spawning. A study was made of the pheromonal influence of the male through water borne factors without success. Rematuration could not be induced in ovigerous females.
The literature review indicated that ovarian rematuration was under the control of an ovary stimulating hormone produced by the thoracic nerve ganglia. Attempts were therefore made to stimulate ovarian rematuration by incorporating the thoracic nerve into the diet of females. Attempts were also made to induce the release of ovary stimulating hormone from the thoracic nerve with 5-hydroxytryptamine, and also with octopamine. No effects were found, but a significant difference between the neurophysiology of the yabby and northern hemisphere crayfish was observed, and the implications of this finding are discussed. The study did not produce any conclusive evidence of an ovary stimulating hormone for the yabby.
A model of ovarian rematuration which collects the findings of the experimental investigations was developed, and was used to suggest a hatchery broodstock management protocol. This model differs from existing models in that rematuration triggers and nutritional status are considered.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cherax destructor</field><field name="subject">yabby</field><field name="subject">yabbies</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">yabby culture</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">hatcheries</field><field name="subject">ovarian development</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.135944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring the marine environment adjacent to a petroleum refinery on Corio Bay, Victoria, Australia</field><field name="creator">Gilbert, Peter James</field><field name="description">The objective of the work reported in this thesis was to design and implement an ecological effects environmental monitoring program which would:
1)         Collect baseline biological information on sessile epibiotic fouling communities from an area adjacent to a petroleum refinery located on Corio Bay, Victoria, to allow comparison with results of future monitoring for the assessment of long term temporal water quality trends.
2)         Detect and &#151; if possible - estimate the magnitude of any influence on epibiotic fouling communities within the Corio Bay marine ecosystem attributable to operations at the Shell Petroleum Refinery.
3)         Investigate the extent of thermal stratification and rate of dispersal of the petroleum refinery main cooling-water outfall plume (discharging up to 350,000 tonnes of warmed seawater per day), and its effect on epibiotic communities within the EPA-defined mixing zone.
A major component of the work undertaken was the design and development of artificial-substrate biological sampling stations suitable for use under the conditions prevailing in Corio Bay, and the development of appropriate quantitative underwater photographic sampling techniques to fulfil the experimental criteria outlined above. Experimental and other constraints imposed on the design of the stations precluded the simple suspension of frames from jetties or pylons, a technique widely used in previous work of this type.
Artificial substrate panels were deployed along three radial transects centred within and extending beyond the petroleum refinery main cooling-water mixing zone. Identical substrate panels were deployed at a number of
 
control sites located throughout Corio Bay, each chosen for differences in their degree of exposure to such factors as water movement, depth, shipping traffic and/or comparable industrial activity.
The rate of colonisation (space utilisation) and the development of epibiotic fouling communities on artificial substrate panels was monitored over two twelve-month sampling periods using quantitative underwater photographic sampling techniques. Sampling was conducted at 4-8 week intervals with the rate of panel colonisation and community structure determined via coverage measurements. Various species of marine algae, polychaete tubeworms, hydroids, barnacles, simple and colonial ascidians, sponges, bivalve molluscs and encrusting bryozoans were all detected growing on panels.
Communities which established on panels within the cooling-water mixing-zone and those at control sites were compared using statistical procedures including agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis. A photographic sample archive has been established to allow comparison with similar future studies.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine pollution</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Corio Bay</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Shell Oil Refinery</field><field name="subject">petroleum</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.140927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the strain experienced by managers and professional Australian footballers using an augmented job strain model</field><field name="creator">Noblet, Andrew</field><field name="description">Generic models of job stress, such as the Job Strain Model (JSM), have recently been criticised for focusing on a small number of general work characteristics while ignoring those that are occupation-specific (Sparks &amp; Cooper, 1999). However this criticism is based on limited research that has not examined the relative influence of all three dimensions of the JSM - job demand, job control and social support - and job-specific stressors. The JSM is the most commonly used model underpinning large-scale occupational stress research (Fox, Dwyer, &amp; Ganster, 1993) and is regarded as the most influential model in the research on the psycho-social work environment, stress and disease in recent times (Kristensen, 1995). This thesis addresses the lack of information on the relative influence of the JSM and job-specific stressors by assessing the capacity of an augmented JSM to predict the strain experienced by managers and professional Australian footballers. The augmented JSM consisted of job-specific stressors in addition to the generic components of the model.
Managers and professional Australian footballers represent two very different occupational groups. While the day-today roles of a manager include planning, organising, monitoring and controlling (Carroll &amp; Gillen, 1987), the working life of a professional Australian footballer revolves around preparing for and playing football (Shanahan, 1998). It was expected that the large differences in the work undertaken by managers and professional Australian footballers would maximise the opportunities for identifying job-specific stressors and measuring the extent that these vary from one group to the next. The large disparity between managers and
 
professional footballers was also used to assess the cross-occupational versatility of the JSM when it had been augmented by job-specific stressors.
This thesis consisted of three major studies. Study One involved a survey of Australian managers, while studies Two and Three focused on professional Australian footballers. The latter group was under-represented in the literature, and as a result of the lack of information on the stressors commonly experienced by this group, an in-depth qualitative study was undertaken in Study Two. The results from Study Two then informed the survey of professional footballers that was conducted in Study Three.
Contrary to previous research examining the relative influence of generic and job-specific stressors, the results only provided moderate support for augmenting the JSM with job-specific stressors. Instead of supporting the versatility of the augmented JSM, the overall findings reinforced the broad relevance of the original JSM. Of the four health outcomes measured in Studies One and Three, there was only one - the psychological health of professional Australian footballers - where the proportion of total variance explained by job-specific stressors exceeded 13%.
Despite the generally strong performance of the JSM across the two occupational groups, the importance of demand, control and support diminished when examining the less conventional occupation of professional football. The generic model was too narrow to capture the highly specific work characteristics that are important for this occupational group and, as a result, the job-specific stressors explained significantly more of the strain over and above that already provided by the generic model. These findings indicate that when investigating the stressors experienced by conventional occupational groups such as managers, the large amount resources required to identify job-specific stressors are unlikely to be cost-effective. In contrast, the influence of the
 
more situation specific stressors is significantly greater in unconventional occupations and thus the benefits of identifying these non-generic stressors are more likely to outweigh the costs.
Studies One and Three identified strong connections between job-specific stressors and important characteristics of the occupation being studied. These connections were consistent with previous research and suggest that before attempting to identify job-specific stressors, researchers need to first become familiar with the nature and context of the occupation.
The final issue addressed in this thesis was the role of work and non-work support. The findings indicate that the support provided by supervisors and colleagues was a significant predictor of wellbeing for both managers and professional footballers. In contrast, the level of explained strain accounted for by non-work support was not significant. These results indicate that when developing strategies to protect and enhance employee well-being, particular attention should be given to monitoring and, where necessary, boosting the effectiveness of work-based support.
The findings from this thesis have been fed back to the management and sporting communities via conference presentations and peer-reviewed journals (refer pp 220-221). All three studies have been presented at national and international conferences and, overall, were well received by participants. Similarly, the methods, results and major findings arising from Studies One and Two have been critiqued by anonymous reviewers from two international journals. These papers have been accepted for publication in 2001 and 2002 and feedback from the reviewers indicates that the findings represent a significant and unique contribution to the literature. The results of Study Three are currently under review by a sports psychology journal.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">job stress</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">executives</field><field name="subject">Australian rules football players</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.141959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology and conservation of insectivorous bats in rural landscapes</field><field name="creator">Lumsden, Linda F</field><field name="description">Throughout the world, the increasing use of land for agriculture has been associated with extensive loss and fragmentation of natural habitats and, frequently, the degradation of remaining habitats. The effects of such habitat changes have been well studied for some faunal groups, but little is known of their consequences for bats. The aim of this study was to investigate the ecology and conservation of an assemblage of insectivorous bats in a rural landscape, with particular focus on their foraging and roosting requirements. This increased knowledge will, hopefully, assist the formulation of policy and management decisions to ensure the long-term survival of bats in these altered environments.
The distribution and abundance of insectivorous bats in the Northern Plains of Victoria was investigated to determine the impacts of land-use change and to identify factors influencing the distribution of bats in rural landscapes. Thirteen species of insectivorous bats were recorded across the region by sampling at 184 sites. Two species were rare, but the remaining 11 species were widespread and occurred in all types of remnant wooded vegetation, ranging from large blocks (&#8805;200 ha) to small isolated remnants (&#8804;5 ha) and scattered trees in cleared farm paddocks. There was no significant difference between remnant types in the relative abundance of bat species, in species richness, or in the composition of bat assemblages at study sites. In a subsequent study, no difference in the activity levels of bats was found between remnants with different tree densities, ranging from densely-vegetated blocks to single paddock trees. However, sites in open paddocks devoid of trees differed significantly from all types of wooded remnants and had significantly lower levels of bat activity and a different species composition. In highly cleared and modified landscapes, all native vegetation has value to bats, even the smallest remnant, roadside and single paddock tree.
Roost sites are a key habitat requirement for bats and may be a limiting resource in highly modified environments. Two species, the lesser long-eared bat Nyctophilus geoffroyi and Gould's wattled bat Chalinolobus gouldii, were investigated as a basis for understanding the capacity of bats to survive in agricultural landscapes. These species have different wing morphologies, which may be influential in how they use the landscape, and anecdotal evidence suggested differences in their roosting ecology.
Roosting ecology was examined using radio-tracking to locate 376 roosts in two study areas with contrasting tree cover in northern Victoria. Both species were highly selective in the location of their roosts in the landscape, in roost-site selection and in roosting behaviour, and responded differently to differing levels of availability of roosts.
The Barmah-Picola study area incorporated remnant vegetation in farmland and an adjacent extensive floodplain forest (Barmah forest). Male N. geojfroyi roosted predominantly within 3 km of their foraging areas in remnants in farmland. However, most female N. geoffroyi, and both sexes of C. gouldii, roosted in Barmah forest up to 12 km from their foraging areas in farmland remnants. These distances were greater than previously recorded for these species and further than predicted by wing morphology. In contrast, in the second study area (Naring) where only small remnants of wooded vegetation remain in farmland, individuals of both species moved significantly shorter distances between roost sites and foraging areas.
There were marked inter- and intra-specific differences in the roosts selected. C. gouldii used similar types of roosts in both areas - predominantly dead spouts in large, live trees. N. geoffroyi used a broader range of roost types, especially in the farmland environment. Roosts were typically under bark and in fissures, with males in particular also using anthropogenic structures. A strong preference was shown by both sexes for roosts in dead trees, and entrance dimensions of roosts were consistently narrow (2.5 cm). In Barmah forest, maternity roosts used by N. geoffroyi were predominantly in narrow fissures in large-diameter, dead trees, while at Naring maternity roosts were also found under bark, in buildings, and in small-diameter, live and dead trees.
The number of roost trees that are required for an individual or colony is influenced by the frequency with which bats move between roosts, the proportion of roosts that are re-used, the distance between consecutive roosts, and the size of roosting colonies. Both species roosted in small colonies and regularly shifted roost sites within a discrete roost area. These behavioural traits suggest that a high density of roost sites is required. There were marked differences in these aspects of behaviour between individuals roosting in Barmah forest and in the fragmented rural landscape. At
Naring, N. geqffroyi remained in roosts for longer periods and moved greater distances between consecutive roosts than in Barmah forest. In contrast, C. gouldii used a smaller pool of roosts in the farmland environment by re-using roosts more frequently. Within Barmah forest, there is an extensive area of forest but the density of hollow-bearing trees is reduced due to timber harvesting and silvicultural practices. Individuals were selective in the location of their roosting areas, with both species selecting parts of the forest that contained higher densities of their preferred roost trees than was generally available in the forest. In contrast, in farmland at Naring, where there were small pockets of remnant vegetation with high densities of potential roost sites surrounded by cleared paddocks with few roosting opportunities, little selection was shown. This suggests that in Barmah forest the density of trees with potential roosts is lower than optimal, while in farmland roosting resources may be adequate in woodland remnants, but limiting at the landscape scale since more than 95% of the landscape now provides no roosting opportunities.
Insectivorous bats appear to be less severely affected than some other faunal groups by habitat fragmentation and land-use change. A highly developed capacity for flight, the spatial scale at which they move and their ability to cross open areas means that they can regularly move among multiple landscape elements, rather than depend on single remnants for all their resources. In addition, bats forage and roost mainly at elevated levels in trees and so are less sensitive to degradation of wooded habitats at ground level. Although seemingly resilient to habitat fragmentation, insectivorous bats are fundamentally dependent on trees for roosting and foraging, and so are vulnerable to habitat loss and ongoing rural tree decline. Protection of the remaining large old trees and measures to ensure regeneration to provide ongoing replacement of hollow-bearing trees through time are critical to ensure the long-term conservation of bats in rural landscapes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insectivorous bats</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.143504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The internet and competitive advantage in Australian professional sport organisations.</field><field name="creator">Evans, Daniel</field><field name="description">The electronic revolution has proven to be a powerful stimulus for change in business practice. As a business tool however, the Internet must endure the same scrutiny under which other business activities are placed. If the use of the Internet in business is a sound strategy, then it must contribute toward competitive advantage. The sport business industry has not been isolated from the vagaries of Internet applications. Moreover, as the industry has become more competitive, forcing sporting organisations towards unprecedented levels of accountability and business practice, the Internet has been increasingly seen as a potential 'holy grail' for sport organisations struggling for revenue (Stewart &amp; Smith, 1999). This research is a response to these pressures. It seeks to identify Internet based opportunities for competitive advantage, and to provide strategies and recommendations for the successful use of the Internet in Australian professional sport organisations.
In realising this objective, a newly developed and integrated Business Activity Model has been constructed. The model assists in the identification of specific Internet based competitive advantage strategies, and provides a theoretical framework for this research. The Business Activity Model conceptualises, for the first time, the relationships between the value chain, constituents of electronically enabled competitive advantage, and the Internet.
With Australia's limited group of fully professional sports capable of sustaining the human resources and budgets necessary to implement comprehensive e-commerce strategies, the organisations selected to participate in this research represent the pinnacle of Australian professional sport clubs. Specifically, the 55 clubs competing in the Australian Football League (A.F.L.), National Basketball League (N.B.L.), National Rugby League (N.R.L.), and National Soccer League (N.S.L.) constituted the research sample and population. In concert with the 87% participation rate, sampling approached a census. A telephone-administered survey, based primarily on
 
the rigorously tested instrument developed by Sethi and King (1994), was employed for data collection.
This research employs a comprehensive set of descriptive statistics, and is bolstered by a confirmatory and an exploratory factor analysis, undertaken on one component of the data. The outcome of this research was the identification of seven practical recommendations for Australian professional sport organisations seeking to improve competitive advantage via the Internet. These recommendations were based on an inventory of the 'gaps' between the strategies proposed by the literature, and the practices of the sample, and relate to both overall Internet strategy, and specific web site applications. The development of the new Business Activity Model and the identification of key online strategy themes support and complement these recommendations. An examination of variations in the practices of participating organisations, and some comparisons against United States sporting organisations, also provides depth and context to the findings.
This research provides a platform for sport managers to effectively harness the potential of the Internet, through their web sites in particular, and realise significant competitive advantages. The Business Activity Model provides managers in all industries with a tool for the detection and understanding of potential elements of competitive advantage, and incorporates all activities critical to business in the new digital economy. Seven practical recommendations for improved online performance based on identified competitive advantage and strategies fulfils the primary objective of this research. E-commerce continues to grow at astronomical rates, and with the Internet poised to become the life-blood of 21st century sporting organisations, these recommendations will assist managers in their ongoing search for competitive advantage.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">internet marketing</field><field name="subject">sports administration</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">professional sports</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.144334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New educational service products : Tertiary EC/EB education - the Asia-Pacific region.</field><field name="creator">Chan, Elsie Siu King</field><field name="description">Electronic Commerce (EC) / Electronic Business (EB) has been (and is expected to continue to be) a dynamic, rapidly evolving area of technology, requiring skilled people with up-to-date knowledge and skills. The global community has required (and still requires) tertiary academic programs to prepare and train these people quickly. In the late nineties, following a tidal wave of tertiary EC program development in the United States, new tertiary programs began to appear in the Asia-Pacific (AP) region to satisfy this need, over a very short period of time. This research project aims to examine whether the development and effectiveness of tertiary EC/EB educational programs can be enhanced through employing a particular marketing paradigm. Four regions - Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong SAR and the Republic of Singapore &#151; were selected from the AP region, for this study. Based on a review of marketing literature, an inductive approach is adopted to build a model for new educational service product offerings. I also provide a description and comprehensive analysis of EC/EB education, and explore the model empirically, examining how it applies to the way EC education programs have been developed, to date.
Essentially, this project consists of two major activities: theory building and theory testing &#150; and is divided into three parts.
Part 1: Preliminary study &#150; literature review for theory building.  This section of the thesis provides a literature review of the domains of curriculum development, EC/EB program development and management, EC/EB component models and new service product development.
Part 2 : Understanding the marketplace &#150; quantitative analysis.  This section comprises five major surveys which provide an understanding of EC/EB education.
Part 3 : In-depth analysis &#150; qualitative research for theory testing.  This section discusses the results of the multiple case studies of EC/EB degree programs undertaken over a five year period.
The results of this project highlight both theoretical and practical aspects of the topic. In terms of the theoretical aspect, I provide a contribution to existing theory concerning the planning and development of new tertiary education programs.
Research into academic course development in the past has tended to assume that all program development is pedagogically based and influenced. There is an assumption that people only develop academic programs and academic courses for pedagogic reasons.
What this research project has done is to suggest that there are, in fact, many possible reasons for developing new programs and that, although these reasons might be pedagogic in nature, they can also be industry-focased, and market-oriented in the following ways:
-the university is shaping the way it is perceived by the public &#150; that is, the market;
-the university is highlighting where its expertise lies. This led me to a form of new service product development consistent with the new image of the university. There is a clear need for diverse models for program development which accommodate the dynamic roles of modern universities. My research project develops such a model based on conditions in the Asia-Pacific region, and discusses findings arising from the overall project, which can be used to improve new educational program offerings in future, in both the Asia-Pacific and, I suggest, in other regions. This potential use of my findings highlights the practical contribution made by the research Project.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Asia Pacific</field><field name="subject">business schools</field><field name="subject">universities and colleges</field><field name="subject">curricula</field><field name="subject">tertiary education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.150155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life events and cognitive processing in sexually dysfunctional individuals</field><field name="creator">Cobain, Marilyn Jeanette</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to make an assessment of the role of the cognitive component in the development of sexual dysfunction.
Past studies have largely focused on the impact of particular events on sexual dysfunction and have not assessed the role of the perception of these events. A number of theories on sexual dysfunction have been developed to explain the influence of cognitions, but these have not been empirically tested.
This study investigated the role of the cognitive evaluation of sexual experiences among 30 sexually dysfunctional participants and 30 control participants who were matched on age, marital status and biological sex.
The Cognitive Aspects of Sexual Dysfunction Measure (CASDM) was constructed to evaluate sexual dysfunction. This measure was designed to tap into the major events in participants&#146; lives and, more importantly, the participants&#146; perceptions of these events.
The components assessed were the intergenerational (family of origin), individual, current life and relationship aspects of the person&#146;s life. These factors were measured from the responses to questions regarding the participant's cognitions about past experiences, the effect of the past experience on the participant at the lime it occurred and the influence this experience had on the participant's sense of self now, their relationship now and sexual functioning now.
The main findings in the intergenerational area were that past experiences were perceived by the sexually dysfunctional group to be having an impact on the self, relationships and their sexual functioning although there were no actual differences between the sexually functional and the sexual dysfunctional participants in the occurrence of the event.
For the individual factors, there were differences between the sexually functional and sexually dysfunctional participants in both values and lifestyle, although these were not perceived to be having an impact on the self, relationship and sexual functioning.
In the relationship area, anger was the major factor separating the sexually functional and sexually dysfunctional groups. Anger was high among the sexually dysfunctional participants and was perceived to be having an impact on self, the couple&#146;s relationship and their sexual functioning. The importance of all these variables in providing a better understanding of the cognitive factors in sexual dysfunction was discussed. The findings demonstrate the importance of cognitions in influencing sexual functioning.
Clinicians should not simply deal with the life experiences of sexually dysfunctional people when attempting to change their behaviour, but should focus on changing cognitions about the behaviours in relation to sexual functioning.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sex</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">psychosexual disorders</field><field name="subject">sexual dysfunction</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.151625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Death and late-stage dementia in institutions: a cultural analysis</field><field name="creator">Abbey, Jennifer Ann</field><field name="description">The first purpose of this study was to describe the deaths of fifteen nursing home residents with late-stage dementia. The devastating effect of dementia on a person has been called a &#145;living death&#146; (Woods, 1989). The caring which occurs when someone is going through this process in a nursing home was recorded and analysed.
In analysing this act of caring, the second purpose was to look for the origins of the structures and the sources of pressure that shaped the context and therefore helped determine the behaviour of the various groups under observation. These groups were residents and their relatives, the staff of the nursing home and the treating doctors.
Before commencing observations and carrying out this study, an understanding needed to be developed of: the condition of dementia as it is perceived by health professionals and presented in the media; the institutions in which the majority of people with dementia end their days; the background and conditions of the staff who nurse in them; the models of care that guide and determine policies; and the conceptions of life and death which underpin relevant laws and moral standpoints.
Accordingly, in part 1. chapter 1 the history, causes, pathology and effects of dementing conditions are examined. Relevant medical and lay literature including media influences are examined which pertain to the subject of death and dementia and nursing home care. The history of this institutional care is briefly examined together with the growth of the discipline of gerontological nursing. Chapter 2 discusses some of the effects of this history on present day care and the concept of emotional work being carried out within the present day aged care public policy regulations. The moral arguments surrounding illness and dying in Australian society today are briefly discussed.
Chapter 3 describes the conceptual framework for the study, the ethnographic method that has been employed and an outline of critical theory as the basis for analysis. The chapter concludes by recounting the practical steps taken to arrange the field work, secure the consent of participants, record data and gather documents, and outlines the ethical considerations given to the undertaking of the study. Chapter 4 describes the context in which the study took place and the first tentative exploration of the culture from an etic perspective.
Part 2 describes the death trajectories observed and raises some questions about alternative strategies that may have been considered within a different paradigm of caring. In chapter 5 the death trajectories of each of the fifteen residents in the study are described, each written with a particular emphasis to illustrate aspects of the
 
culture of care that emerged through thematic analysis. Observations, comments and feelings from staff and family are wound in and around these case studies. Chapter 6 looks more closely at the impact of policy and institutional pressure on the milieu in which these deaths took place.
Part 3 draws conclusions from the observations and makes suggestions for emancipatory change as viewed from the author's standpoint of critical ethnographic analysis. In the final chapter an argument is presented for policy change that leads a movement towards palliative care practices for people with late-stage dementia. Approaches to implementation of palliative care will need to take account of any expression by the resident such as an advanced directive, indicating a preferred approach to treatment in the period prior to death; a need for a better understanding of such issues as the significance of body breakdown, the manifestations of pain and electrolyte imbalances; the surrounding ethical complexities and shift in public opinion, and perhaps, most of ail, the culture of the institutions in which this dying will take place. A definition of late-stage dementia which might be used in determining patterns of care is set out.
A discussion about changes in practice which relate lo communication with treating doctors, the administering of antibiotics, the relief of pain, the mobilisation of residents and the provision of food and water takes place in light of the evidence found. The discussion of these issues is raised in the form of debate. Each aspect needs more rigorous analysis and information so that evidence-based practice, rather than care which is value-laden and emotional, can be used when treatment decisions are made for people with late-stage dementia.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">nursing homes</field><field name="subject">patients</field><field name="subject">care</field><field name="subject">dementia</field><field name="subject">death</field><field name="subject">aultural analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.153139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Beyond God the father' : The metaphysical in a physical world.</field><field name="creator">White, Barbara A</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tim Winton</field><field name="subject">Helen Garner</field><field name="subject">Venero Armanno</field><field name="subject">metaphysics in literature</field><field name="subject">transcendence in literature</field><field name="subject">philosophy in literature</field><field name="subject">postmodernism</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.154051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Apprehending butterflies and flying beauties: Bringing magical realism to ground</field><field name="creator">Takolander, Maria</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fantasy literature</field><field name="subject">history and criticism</field><field name="subject">magic realism</field><field name="subject">supernatural in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050825.154534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial thinking processes employed by primary school students engaged in mathematical problem solving</field><field name="creator">Owens, Kay Dianne</field><field name="description">This thesis describes changes in the spatial thinking of Year 2 and Year 4 students who participated in a six-week long spatio-mathematical program.  The main investigation, which contained quantitative and qualitative components, was designed to answer questions which were identified in a comprehensive review of pertinent literatures dealing with (a) young children's development of spatial concepts and skills, (b) how students solve problems and learn in different types of classrooms, and (c) the special roles of visual imagery, equipment, and classroom discourse in spatial problem solving.
The quantitative investigation into the effects of a two-dimensional spatial program used a matched-group experimental design. Parallel forms of a specially developed spatio-mathematical group test were administered on three occasions&#151;before, immediately after, and six to eight weeks after the spatial program. The test contained items requiring spatial thinking about two-dimensional space and other items requiring transfer to thinking about three-dimensional space. The results of the experimental group were compared with those of a &#145;control&#146; group who were involved in number problem-solving activities. The investigation took into account gender and year at school. In addition, the effects of different classroom organisations on spatial thinking were investigated~one group worked mainly individually and the other group in small cooperative groups.
The study found that improvements in scores on the delayed posttest of two-dimensional spatial thinking by students who were engaged in the spatial learning experiences were statistically significantly greater than those of the control group when pretest scores were used as covariates. Gender was the only variable to show an effect on the three-dimensional delayed posttest.
The study also attempted to explain how improvements in, spatial thinking occurred. The qualitative component of the study involved students in different contexts. Students were video-taped as they worked, and much observational and interview data were obtained and analysed to develop categories which were described and inter-related in a model of children's responsiveness to spatial problem-solving experiences. The model and the details of children's thinking were related to literatures on visual imagery, selective attention, representation, and concept construction.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">problem solving in children</field><field name="subject">spatial teaching</field><field name="subject">mathematical problem solving</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050826.100440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of DAL and DAPL languages for building distributed applications.</field><field name="creator">Dew, Robert</field><field name="description">A common characteristic among parallel/distributed programming languages is that the one language is used to specify not only the overall organisation of the distributed application, but also the functionality of the application. That is, the connectivity and functionality of processes are specified within a single program.
Connectivity and functionality are independent aspects of a distributed application. This thesis shows that these two aspects can be specified separately, therefore allowing application designers to freely concentrate on either aspect in a modular fashion. Two new programming languages have been developed for specifying each aspect. These languages are for loosely coupled distributed applications based on message passing, and have been designed to simplify distributed programming by completely removing all low level interprocess communication. A suite of languages and tools has been designed and developed. It includes the two new languages, parsers, a compilation system to generate intermediate C code that is compiled to binary object modules, a run-time system to create, manage and terminate several distributed applications, and a shell to communicate with the run-tune system. DAL (Distributed Application Language) and DAPL (Distributed Application Process Language) are the new programming languages for the specification and development of process oriented, asynchronous message passing, distributed applications. These two languages have been designed and developed as part of this doctorate in order to specify such distributed applications that execute on a cluster of computers. Both languages are used to specify orthogonal components of an application, on the one hand the organisation of processes that constitute an application, and on the other the interface and functionality of each process. Consequently, these components can be created in a modular fashion, individually and concurrently.
The DAL language is used to specify not only the connectivity of all processes within an application, but also a cluster of computers for which the application executes. Furthermore, sub-clusters can be specified for individual processes of an application to constrain a process to a particular group of computers. The second language, DAPL, is used to specify the interface, functionality and data structures of application processes. In addition to these languages, a DAL parser, a DAPL parser, and a compilation system have been designed and developed (in this project). This compilation system takes DAL and DAPL programs to generate object modules based on machine code, one module for each application process. These object modules are used by the Distributed Application System (DAS) to instantiate and manage distributed applications.
The DAS system is another new component of this project. The purpose of the DAS system is to create, manage, and terminate many distributed applications of similar and different configurations. The creation procedure incorporates the automatic allocation of processes to remote machines. Application management includes several operations such as deletion, addition, replacement, and movement of processes, and also detection and reaction to faults such as a processor crash. A DAS operator communicates with the DAS system via a textual shell called DASH (Distributed Application SHell). This suite of languages and tools allowed distributed applications of varying connectivity and functionality to be specified quickly and simply at a high level of abstraction. DAL and DAPL programs of several processes may require a few dozen lines to specify as compared to several hundred lines of equivalent C code that is generated by the compilation system. Furthermore, the DAL and DAPL compilation system is successful at generating binary object modules, and the DAS system succeeds in instantiating and managing several distributed applications on a cluster.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Real-time data processing</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">DAPL</field><field name="subject">Computer program language</field><field name="subject">DAL</field><field name="subject">Computer program language</field><field name="subject">distributed applications</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050826.101627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The meaning of home: A comparison of the meaning of home as identified by samples of Victorians with, and without, an intellectual disability.</field><field name="creator">Annison, John Edward</field><field name="description">This phenomenological study of the meaning of home from the perspectives of people with and without an intellectual disability sought to identify, (a) any common &#145;essence&#146; of meaning held by and, (b) the nature of any differences of perception between, the groups. Purposive samples of 18 people with an intellectual disability and 21 non-disabled people were surveyed using a semi-structured interview to ascertain their experiences of home and 'non-homes'. Inductive analysis of the data revealed a shared understanding of the meaning of home at a fundamental level. This shared meaning of home was found to comprise: the ability to exert control over an area; having a personalised space; feeling content with the living situation; a sense of familiarity with the setting; a set of behaviours and routines usually only enacted when at home; common names and uses for rooms; socialising at home with others; the importance of a positive social atmosphere in the home; and, recognition of places as non-homes because they lacked one or more of these attributes. Further analysis revealed the essence of home is its experience as the place where stress is most reduced or minimised for the individual. The study demonstrates that the concept of stress is superordinate to previously identified concepts considered fundamental to home such as privacy, control and non-homes. Major differences between the two samples were largely differences of degree with people who have an intellectual disability reporting the same fundamental attributes of home as people who do not have an intellectual disability, but in a less elaborated form. Principal among these differences of degree was the notion of control over the home and its derivative elements which encompassed the whole dwelling including its setting for people without an intellectual disability but was very restricted for people with an intellectual disability being largely confined to the person's bedroom.  Socialising in or from the home was also very limited for people with an intellectual disability in comparison with that experienced by non-disabled informants with the former group conveying an impression of leading significantly socially isolated lives at home. The major implications of this study are related to the meaning of home per se, to residential service provision to people with an intellectual disability, and to future research.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Housing</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">people with mental disabilities</field><field name="subject">meaning of home</field><field name="subject">intellectual disabilities</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050826.102639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of insulin signalling by exercise in skeletal muscle</field><field name="creator">Wadley, Glenn</field><field name="description">Regular physical activity improves insulin action and is an effective therapy for the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes. However, little is known of the mechanisms by which exercise improves insulin action in muscle. These studies investigate the actions of a single bout of exercise and short-term endurance training on insulin signalling. Twenty-four hours following the completion of a single bout of endurance exercise insulin action improved, although greater enhancement of insulin action was demonstrated following the completion of endurance training, implying that cumulative bouts of exercise substantially increase insulin action above that seen from the residual effects of an acute bout of prior exercise. No alteration in the abundance and phosphorylation of proximal members of the insulin-signalling cascade in skeletal muscle, including the insulin receptor and IRS-1 were found. A major finding however, was the significant increase in the serine phosphorylation of a known downstream signalling protein, Akt (1.5 fold, p &#8804;0.05) following an acute bout of exercise and exercise training. This was matched by the observed increase in protein abundance of SHPTP2 (1.6 fold, p &#8804;0.05) a protein tyrosine phosphatase, in the cytosolic fraction of skeletal muscle following endurance exercise. These data suggest a small positive role for SHPTP2 on insulin stimulated glucose transport consistent with transgenic mice models. Further studies were aimed at examining the gene expression following a single bout of either resistance or endurance exercise. There were significant transient increases in IRS-2 mRNA concentration in the few hours following a single bout of both endurance and resistance exercise. IRS-2 protein abundance was also observed to significantly increase 24-hours following a single bout of endurance exercise indicating transcriptional regulation of IRS-2 following muscular contraction. One final component of this PhD project was to examine a second novel insulin-signalling pathway via c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation that has recently been shown to be essential for insulin stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. No evidence was found for the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in the skeletal muscle of Zucker rats despite demonstrating significant phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and Akt by insulin treatment and successfully immunoprecipitating c-Cbl protein. Surprisingly, there was a small but significant increase in c-Cbl protein expression following insulin-stimulation, however c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation does not appear to be associated with insulin or exercise-mediated glucose transport in skeletal muscle.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-insulin-dependent diabetes</field><field name="subject">pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">physiological effect</field><field name="subject">strained muscle</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">insulin</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050826.111050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Econstruction: The nature/culture opposition in texts about whales and whaling.</field><field name="creator">Pritchard, Gregory R</field><field name="description">A perceived opposition between 'culture' and 'nature', presented as a dominant, biased and antagonistic relationship, is engrained in the language of Western culture.

I examine the way language influences our relationship with the world and trace the historical conception of &#145;nature&#146; and its influence on the English language. The whale is, for many people, an important symbol of the natural world, and human interaction with these animals is an indication of our attitudes to the natural world in general. By focusing on whale texts (including older narratives, whaling books, novels and other whale-related texts), I explore the portrayal of whales and the natural world.

This strongly biases such systems towards particular hypothesis types but there is reason believe that many domains have underlying concepts which do not involve axis orthogonal surfaces. Further, the multiplicity of small decision regions mitigates against any holistic appreciation of the theories produced by these systems, notwithstanding the fact that many of the small regions are individually comprehensible. This thesis investigates modeling concepts as large geometric structures in n-dimensional space.
Convex hulls are a superset of the set of axis orthogonal hyperrectangles into which axis orthogonal systems partition the instance space. In consequence, there is reason to believe that convex hulls might provide a more flexible and general learning bias than axis orthogonal regions. The formation of convex hulls around a group of points of the same class is shown to be a usable generalisation and is more general than generalisations produced by axis-orthogonal based classifiers, without constructive induction, like decision trees, decision lists and rules. The use of a small number of large hulls as a concept representation is shown to provide classification performance which can be better than that of classifiers which use a large number of small fragmentary regions for each concept.
A convex hull based classifier, CH1, has been implemented and tested. CH1 can handle categorical and continuous data. Algorithms for two basic generalisation operations on hulls, inflation and facet deletion, are presented. The two operations are shown to improve the accuracy of the classifier and provide moderate classification accuracy over a representative selection of typical, largely or wholly continuous valued machine learning tasks. The classifier exhibits superior performance to well-known axis-orthogonal-based classifiers when presented with domains where the underlying decision surfaces are not axis parallel. The strengths and weaknesses of the system are
identified. One particular advantage is the ability of the system to model domains with approximately the same number of structures as there are underlying concepts. This leads to the possibility of extraction of higher level mathematical descriptions of the induced concepts, using the techniques of computational geometry, which is not possible from a multiplicity of small regions.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">induction</field><field name="subject">convex hulls</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050826.112245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flowering ecology of a Box-Ironbark Eucalyptus community.</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Jenny</field><field name="description">Box-Ironbark forests occur on the inland hills of the Great Dividing Range in Australia, from western Victoria to southern Queensland. These dry, open forests are characteristically dominated by Eucalyptus species such as Red Ironbark E. tricarpa, Mugga Ironbark E. sideroxylon and Grey Box E. microcarpa. Within these forests, several Eucalyptus species are a major source of nectar for the blossom-feeding birds and marsupials that form a distinctive component of the fauna.
In Victoria, approximately 83% of the original pre - European forests of the Box-Ironbark region have been cleared, and the remaining fragmented forests have been heavily exploited for gold and timber. This exploitation has lead to a change in the structure of these forests, from one dominated by large 80-100 cm diameter, widely -spaced trees to mostly small (&#8805;40 cm DBH), more densely - spaced trees.
This thesis examines the flowering ecology of seven Eucalyptus species within a Box-Ironbark community. These species are characteristic of Victorian Box-Ironbark forests; River Red Gum E. camaldulensis, Yellow Gum E. leucoxylon, Red Stringybark E. macrorhyncha, Yellow Box E. melliodora, Grey Box E. microcarpa, Red Box E. polyanthemos and Red Ironbark E. tricarpa. Specifically, the topics examined in this thesis are: (1) the floral character traits of species, and the extent to which these traits can be associated with syndromes of bird or insect pollination; (2) the timing, frequency, duration, intensity, and synchrony of flowering of populations and individual trees; (3) the factors that may explain variation in flowering patterns of individual trees through examination of the relationships between flowering and tree-specific factors of individually marked trees; (4) the influence of tree size on the flowering patterns of individually marked trees, and (5) the spatial and temporal distribution of the floral resources of a dominant species, E. tricarpa. The results are discussed in relation to the evolutionary processes that may have lead to the flowering patterns, and the likely effects of these flowering patterns on blossom-feeding fauna of the Box-Ironbark region.
Flowering observations were made for approximately 100 individually marked trees for each species (a total of 754 trees). The flower cover of each tree was assessed at a mean interval of 22 (+ 0.6) days for three years; 1997, 1998 and 1999. The seven species of eucalypt each had characteristic flowering seasons, the timing of which was similar each year. In particular, the timing of peak flowering intensity was consistent between years. Other spatial and temporal aspects of flowering patterns for each species, including the percentage of trees that flowered, frequency of flowering, intensity of flowering and duration of flowering, displayed significant variation between years, between forest stands (sites) and between individual trees within sites. All seven species displayed similar trends in flowering phenology over the study, such that 1997 was a relatively 'poor' flowering year, 1998 a 'good' year and 1999 an 'average' year in this study area.
The floral character traits and flowering seasons of the seven Eucalyptus species suggest that each species has traits that can be broadly associated with particular pollinator types. Differences between species in floral traits were most apparent between 'summer' and 'winter' flowering species. Winter - flowering species displayed pollination syndromes associated with bird pollination and summer -flowering species displayed syndromes more associated with insect pollination. Winter - flowering E. tricarpa and E. leucoxylon flowers, for example, were significantly larger, and contained significantly greater volumes of nectar, than those of the summer flowering species, such as E. camaldulensis and E. melliodom.
An examination of environmental and tree-specific factors was undertaken to investigate relationships between flowering patterns of individually marked trees of E. microcarpa and E. tricarpa and a range of measures that may influence the observed patterns. A positive association with tree-size was the most consistent explanatory variable for variation between trees in the frequency and intensity of flowering. Competition from near-neighbours, tree health and the number of shrubs within the canopy area were also explanatory variables.
The relationship between tree size and flowering phenology was further examined by using the marked trees of all seven species, selected to represent five size-classes. Larger trees (&#8805;40 cm DBH) flowered more frequently, more intensely, and for a greater duration than smaller trees. Larger trees provide more abundant floral resources than smaller trees because they have more flowers per unit area of canopy, they have larger canopies in which more flowers can be supported, and they provide a greater abundance of floral resources over the duration of the flowering season.
Heterogeneity in the distribution of floral resources was further highlighted by the study of flowering patterns of E. tricarpa at several spatial and temporal scales. A total of approximately 5,500 trees of different size classes were sampled for flower cover along transects in major forest blocks at each of five sample dates. The abundance of flowers varied between forest blocks, between transects and among tree size - classes. Nectar volumes in flowers of E. tricarpa were sampled. The volume of nectar varied significantly among flowers, between trees, and between forest stands. Mean nectar volume per flower was similar on each sample date.
The study of large numbers of individual trees for each of seven species was useful in obtaining quantitative data on flowering patterns of species' populations and individual trees. The timing of flowering for a species is likely to be a result of evolutionary selective forces tempered by environmental conditions. The seven species' populations showed a similar pattern in the frequency and intensity of flowering between years (e.g. 1998 was a 'good' year for most species) suggesting that there is some underlying environmental influence acting on these aspects of flowering.
For individual trees, the timing of flowering may be influenced by tree-specific factors that affect the ability of each tree to access soil moisture and nutrients. In turn, local weather patterns, edaphic and biotic associations are likely to influence the available soil moisture. The relationships between the timing of flowering and environmental conditions are likely to be complex.
There was no evidence that competition for pollinators has a strong selective influence on the timing of flowering. However, as there is year-round flowering in this community, particular types of pollinators may be differentiated along a temporal gradient (e.g. insects in summer, birds in winter). This type of differentiation may have resulted in the co-evolution of floral traits and pollinator types, with flowers displaying adaptations that match the morphologies and energy requirements of the most abundant pollinators in any particular season.
Spatial variation in flowering patterns was evident at several levels. This is likely to occur because of variation in climate, weather patterns, soil types, degrees of disturbance and biotic associations, which vary across the Box-Ironbark region. There was no consistency among sites between years in flowering patterns suggesting that factors affecting flowering at this level are complex.
Blossom-feeding animals are confronted with a highly spatially and temporally patchy resource. This patchiness has been increased with human exploitation of these forests leading to a much greater abundance of small trees and fewer large trees. Blossom-feeding birds are likely to respond to this variation in different ways, depending upon diet-breadth, mobility and morphological and behavioural characteristics.
Future conservation of the blossom-feeding fauna of Box-Ironbark forests would benefit from the retention of a greater number of large trees, the protection and enhancement of existing remnants, and revegetation with key species, such as E. leucoxylon, E. microcarpa and E. tricarpa. The selective clearing of summer flowering species, which occur on the more fertile areas, may have negatively affected the year-round abundance and distribution of floral resources. The unpredictability of the spatial distribution of flowering patches within the region means that all remnants are likely to be important foraging areas in some years.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">flowering</field><field name="subject">box ironbark eucalyptus</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050826.113429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information-based regulation of high-velocity foot-targeting tasks</field><field name="creator">Bradshaw, Elizabeth J</field><field name="description">Judging time-to-contact with a target is an important criterion for avoiding harm in everyday walking and running tasks, and maximizing performance in high-velocity sporting tasks. The information-based regulation of step length and duration during target-directed locomotion was examined in relation to gait mode, approach velocity, target task, expertise, and sporting performance during a series of four experiments. The first three experiments examined novice performers (Each n=12, 6 males, 6 females), whilst the last experiment examined expert gymnasts (n=5). Two reference strips with alternating 50cm black and white intervals were placed on either side of the approach strip for all of the experiments. One 50Hz-panning video camera filmed the approach from an elevated position. In Experiment 4, two stationary 250Hz cameras filmed the post-flight performance of the gymnastic vaults and, in addition, two qualified judges provided a performance score for each vaulting trial. The panning video footage in each experiment was digitized to deduce the gait characteristics. In Experiment 4, the high-speed video footage was analyzed three-dimensionally to obtain the performance measures such as post-flight height. The utilization of visual stimulus in target-directed locomotion is affected by the observer's state of motion as characterized by the mode of locomotion and also often the speed of locomotion. In addition, experience plays an important role in the capacity of the observer to utilize visual stimulus to control the muscular action of locomotion when either maintaining or adjusting the step mechanics. The characteristics of the terrain and the target also affect the observer's movement. Visual regulation of step length decreases at higher approach speeds in novice performers, where as expert performers are capable of increasing visual regulation at higher approach speeds. Conservatism in final foot placement by female participants accounts for the observed increase in distance from the critical boundary of the
 
obstacle relative to toe placement. Behavioural effects of gender thus affect the control of final foot placement in obstacle-directed locomotion. The visual control of braking in target-directed locomotion is described by a tau-dot of-0.54. When tau-dot is below -0.54 a hard collision with the obstacle will occur, however, when tau-dot is above -0.54, a soft collision with the target will occur. It is suggested that the tau-dot margin defining the control of braking reveals the braking capacity of the system. In the target-directed locomotion examined a tau-dot greater than -0.70 would possibly exceed the braking capacity of the system, thus, leading to injury if performed. The approach towards the take-off board and vaulting horse in gymnastics is an example of target-directed locomotion in sport. Increased visual regulation of the timing and length of each step is a requirement for a fast running approach, a fundamental building block for the execution of complex vaults in gymnastics. The successful performance of complex vaults in gymnastics leads towards a higher judge's score. Future research suggestions include an investigation of visual regulation of step length in curved target-directed locomotion.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">gait in humans</field><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="subject">walking</field><field name="subject">running</field><field name="subject">maximising performance</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050826.114057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Skeletal muscle fat metabolism during post-exercise recovery in humans.</field><field name="creator">Kimber, Nicholas E</field><field name="description">Recovery after prolonged or high-intensity exercise is characterised by a substantial increase in adipose tissue lipolysis, resulting in elevated rates of plasma-derived fat oxidation. Despite the large increase in circulating fatty acids (FAs) after exercise, only a small fraction of this is taken up by exercised muscle in the lower extremities. Indeed, the predominant fate of non-oxidised FAs derived from post-exercise lipolysis is reesteriflcation hi the liver. During recovery from endurance exercise, a number of changes also occur hi skeletal muscle that allow for a high metabolic priority towards glycogen resynthesis. Reducing muscle glycogen during exercise potentiates these effects, however the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating substrate oxidation following exercise remain poorly defined. The broad arm of this thesis was to examine the regulation of fat metabolism during recovery from glycogen-lowering exercise hi the presence of altered fat and glucose availability. In study I, eight endurance-trained males completed a bout of exhaustive exercise followed by ingestion of carbohydrate (CHO)-rich meals (64-70% of energy from CHO) at 1, 4, and 7 h of recovery. Duplicate muscle biopsies were obtained at exhaustion and 3, 6 and 18 h of recovery. Despite the large intake of CHO during recovery (491 &#177; 28 g or 6.8 + 0.3 g &#149; kg-1), respiratory exchange ratio values of 0.77 to 0.84 indicated a greater reliance on fat as an oxidative fuel. Intramuscular triacylglycerol (IMTG) content remained unchanged in the presence of elevated glucose and insulin levels during recovery , suggesting IMTG has a negligible role in contributing to the enhanced fat oxidation after exhaustive exercise. It appears that the partitioning of exogenous glucose towards glycogen resynthesis is of high metabolic priority during immediate post-exercise recovery, supported by the trend towards reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and increased fat oxidation. The effect of altering plasma FA availability during post-exercise recovery was examined in study II. Eight endurance-trained males performed three trials consisting of glycogen-lowering exercise, followed by infusion of either saline (CON), saline + nicotinic acid (NA) (LFA) or Intralipid and heparin (HFA). Muscle biopsies were obtained at the end of exercise (0 h) and at 3 and 6 h in recovery. Altering the availability of plasma FAs during recovery induced changes in whole-body fat oxidation that were unrelated to differences in skeletal muscle malonyl-CoA. Furthermore, fat oxidation and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation appear to be dissociated after exercise, suggesting mechanisms other than phosphorylation-mediated changes in ACC activity have an important role in regulating malonyl-CoA and fat metabolism in human skeletal muscle after exercise. Alternative mechanisms include citrate and long-chain fatty acyl-CoA mediated changes in ACC activity, or differences in malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) activity. Reducing plasma FA concentrations with NA attenuated the post-exercise increase in MCD and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) gene expression, suggesting that FAs and/or other factors induced by NA are involved hi the regulation of these genes. Despite marked changes hi plasma FA availability, no significant changes in IMTG concentration were detected, providing further evidence that plasma-derived FAs are the preferential fuel source contributing to the enhanced fat oxidation post-exercise during recovery. To further examine the effect of substrate availability after exercise, Study III investigated the regulation of fat metabolism during a 6 h recovery period with or without glucose infusion. Enhanced glucose availability significantly increased CHO oxidation compared with the fasted state, although no differences in whole-body fat oxidation were apparent. Consistent with the similar rates of fat metabolism, no difference hi AMPK or ACC&#946; phosphorylation were observed between trials. In addition, no significant treatment or time effects for IMTG concentration were detected during recovery. The large exercise-induced PDK4 gene expression was attenuated when plasma FAs were reduced during glucose infusion, supporting the hypothesis that PDK4 is responsive to sustained changes in lipid availability and/or changes in plasma insulin. Furthermore, the possibility exists that the suppression of PDK4 mRNA also reduced PDK activity and thus maintained PDH activity to account for the higher rates of CHO oxidation observed during glucose infusion compared with the control trial.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">strained muscle</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">fatty acids</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">skeletal muscle</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050826.115311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Principalship and policy in small New Zealand primary schools.</field><field name="creator">Collins, Graham J</field><field name="description">This research investigates the relationship between principalship and policy in small New Zealand primary schools. A distinctive feature of small primary schools is that their principals typically have to teach as well as manage. Overseas research indicates that in times of educational reform, teaching principals face particular difficulty and may need special support. Following the watershed educational reforms of 1989 and a decade of &#145;hands-off&#146; policy in education (1989-1999), central policy towards school support in New Zealand is now more &#145;hands-on&#146;. The impact of this policy change on small schools has not been researched hi New Zealand, where such schools make up over fifty percent of all primary schools.
The aims of this study are to analyse the impact of current support policy in New Zealand on small primary school principalship, and to evaluate the extent to which policy adjustment might be needed in the future. Using multiple methods and a case study approach to gather data, the study focuses on small school principalship in one New Zealand region - the Central Districts region. It also considers the recent policy initiatives, their rationale and the extent to which they appear to be meeting the support needs reported by the principals whose work has been researched in the study.
Broadly, the study has found that within small schools, the role-balance within a teaching principal&#146;s work is a critical factor, as the ratio within the principal&#146;s role-balance between the teaching role and the management role creates variation in work-demands, work-strategies and types of support needed. Teaching principals in New Zealand generally feel better supported now than they did in the 1990s and the study identifies factors associated with this change. However the analysis in this study suggests that the current policy aim to both rationalise and strengthen the small school network as a whole is rather problematic. Without better targeted support policy in this area, old style parochial and competitive attitudes between schools are unlikely to change in the future.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary school principals</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">education and state</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050826.120007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of fish inhabiting the inter-tidal zone of Swan Bay, Victoria, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Jessop, Rosalind Elinor</field><field name="description">Swan Bay is a shallow marine embayment of Port Phillip Bay, just north of Queenscliff, Victoria.  It has been part of the Harold Holt Marine Reserves since 1977 and is a seagrass habitat. This study investigated the species of fish present in the inter-tidal zone of Swan Bay, collected information on their ecology, investigated the importance of Swan Bay compared to Port Phillip Bay as a nursery and/or breeding area and compared these results with those of similar seagrsss habitats.
Field work was carried out monthly over a two year period, from April 1981 to April 1983, using beach seine nets at Swan Bay and Portarlington.
Forty four species of fish were identified from Swan Bay and nineteen from Portarlington. Fish were most abundant during the summer and autumn months when seagrass growth was at a maximum and least abundant during winter due to the absence of seasonal residents and decreased numbers of permanent residents.
Swan Bay was found to be an important nursery ground for two commercially-caught species: the Yellow-eye Mullet and the King George Whiting.   Juvenile Yellow-eye Mullet were more numerous in Swan Bay than at Portarlington. Smell juvenile King George Whiting were more abundant at Portarlington than in Swan Bay where older juveniles were more numerous.
The fish fauna of Swan Bay was found to be similar to western Port but the abundance of species varied. Atherinosome microstoma was the dominant species in terms of abundance and biomass. Diet was found to be different from that reported by Robertson (1979) at Western Port due to the different range of prey items.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fishes</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Swan Bay</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Portarlington</field><field name="subject">intertidal animals</field><field name="subject">seagrass</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050826.121023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The narrativization of actuality: Convergence of form and genre in film and television.</field><field name="creator">Perry, Colin</field><field name="description">The thesis concerns the treatment of actuality in film and television, particularly the narrativization of actuality images, and the context of their placement within audio/visual texts. Several instances of the convergence of media form and genre are analyzed, and the conventions of classificatory systems and boundaries that pertain to film and television representations are reconsidered in light of changes in the conventions of genre. The distinction between, and convergence of fictional and non-fictional conventions of narrative are therefore central to the thesis, as are the related issues of viewer response, the nature of subjectivity in the viewer, the connectivity of text and culture, and the relations of actuality to the text. The thesis traces the narrativization of actuality through textual, formal and genre boundaries, adopting a &#145;line of flight or deterritorialization&#146; that enables the thesis to &#145;change in nature and connect with other multiplicities.&#146;This line of flight passes through the conventional separation of genre groupings and texts, and, similarly, has been applied in the thesis as a rationale for the diminution of theoretical boundaries.
A multiperpectival approach is applied to the permeability of, or transcendent relations of the analysis to the boundaries between genres, between texts and culture, and between actuality and virtual representation. In the thesis there is also a theoretical deterritorialization that consents to a pluralism of theory, which is an approach demonstrated by Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus. The model of multi-perspectivalism adopted in the thesis engages in establishing connections and similarities between theories, rather than emphasizing contradictory and exclusive practices. The Foucauldian notion of the rules of formation in discourse, Nichols&#146; theories of documentary representation of reality, Bordwell&#146;s schematic interpretation, and several other positions are critiqued, as the line of flight embarked upon in the thesis intersects with, and passes through both textual and theoretical boundaries.
The thesis consists of two parts: firstly, a location of theoretical perspective, in which the issues of theory pertaining to actuality and narrative are explicated, and the methodological approach of the thesis is defined. The second part commences with an analysis of the most familiar instances of actuality in film and television, with particular attention to documentary forms. It then engages in the analysis of films that represent actuality but which, in the process of narrativization, display a convergence of genre conventions. The films selected for analysis include Steven Speilberg's Schindler's List, (1993) Oliver Stone's JFK, (1991) and Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump, (1994) and Contact, (1996). Hence the thesis is concerned with the application of a pluralist theoretical approach, with, however, an emphasis on the Deleuzo-Guattarian notions of rhizome and assemblage. Within this theoretical frame, the connections between actuality and the audio/visual text are explicated, and the formation of text as &#145;a rhizome with the world&#146;, is analyzed across a range of examples.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">realism in motion pictures</field><field name="subject">realism on television</field><field name="subject">realism</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">narrative</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Guattari</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.092326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variables influencing the mathematics performance of first-year tertiary students: A case study.</field><field name="creator">Pongboriboon, Yachai</field><field name="description">The need to understand which factors most strongly affect performance in first-year mathematics programs at Khon Kaen University (KKU), in North Eastern Thailand, provided the main focus of the study which is described. First-year mathematics students in the 1990-1991 academic year, from four KKU faculty groups (Medicine and Nursing, Agriculture, Science and Education, and Engineering) were involved in this study.
Research literatures addressing variables which were likely to influence performance in early tertiary mathematical study, and variables associated with difficulties in learning mathematics at the transition from upper secondary school to tertiary studies, were reviewed.
The first major aim of the study was to identify the variables which were good predictors of first-year mathematics performance at KKU. Results from stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that the following predictor variables were statistically significant and entered the regression equations for most Faculty groups: School Mathematics Achievement, Self-Esteem, Study Habits in Mathematics, and Faculty of Study. Other predictor variables that sometimes entered regression equations (depending on the Faculty group) were Socio-Economic-Status, Mathematics Language Competence, Mathematics Confidence, Attitude Towards Mathematics, and Gender. Depending on Faculty group, the statistically significant variables accounted for between 11% and 74% of scores on fist-year KKU mathematics examinations. The predictor variables contributed much more to the variance of scores on first-semester mathematics examinations than to the variance of scores on second-semester mathematics examinations.
It was also found that scores on the Direct Entry Examination Mathematics test (administered by KKU) and the School Mathematics Achievement test (developed and administered by the author) had stronger correlations with first-year KKU mathematics performance than did scores on the National Entry Examination Mathematics tests (administered by the Thai Ministry of University Affairs). Scores on the three pre-university mathematics achievement test instruments were better predictors of first-semester mathematics performance than of second-semester mathematics performance.
It was found that the mean Mathematics Confidence of male students was statistically significantly higher than that of female students, but there were no statistically significant gender differences in Mathematics Misplaced Confidence. Only about 30% of the main sample ( 30% of the male and 30% of the female sample groups) had appropriate confidence in mathematics, that is, they thought their answers were correct when they were, in fact, correct, and they thought they were wrong when they were, in fact, incorrect.
So far as Faculty performance differences were concerned, Engineering students had the highest Mathematics Confidence scores, followed by the Medicine and Nursing group of students and the Science and Education group students. Agriculture students had the lowest mean Mathematics Confidence score. No statistically significant differences occurred in Mathematics Misplaced Confidence between different Faculty groups.
The second main aim of the study was to investigate why many first-year students experienced difficulties in coping with their mathematics units. A small group of senior secondary mathematics teachers, university mathematics lecturers, and first-year mathematics students were interviewed during the first semester of the 1990-1991 academic year. Interviews were conducted by the author according to a questionnaire format, and were aimed at identifying factors causing difficulty in the transition from senior secondary to university mathematical study. The analysis of the quantitative data together with the interview data indicated that the major sources of difficulty were associated with: (a) students' mathematical abilities; (b) curriculum content; (c) course organisation; (d) students' study habits; (e) instructional styles; and (f) assessment procedures.
The results of the investigation are discussed in the light of the relevant literature and related research.
The study concludes with recommendations which are addressed to mathematics teachers and education administrators in senior secondary schools in Thailand, to the Thai Ministry of Education, and to the KKU Department of Mathematics.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">academic achievement</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Khon Kaen University</field><field name="subject">KKU</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="subject">study habits</field><field name="subject">mathematics language</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.093515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Older adults' neuromuscular adaptations to resistance training and effects on challenging gait tasks.</field><field name="creator">Lamoureux, Ecosse</field><field name="description">Community locomotion is threatened when older individuals are required to negotiate obstacles, which place considerable stress on the musculoskeletal system. The vulnerability of older adults during challenging locomotor tasks is further compromised by age-related strength decline and muscle atrophy.
The first study in this investigation determined the relationship between the major muscle groups of the lower body and challenging locomotor tasks commonly found in the community environment of older adults. Twenty-nine females and sixteen males aged between 62 and 88 years old (68.2 &#177;6.5) were tested for the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) strength of the knee extensors and 1-RM for the hip extensors, flexors, adductors, abductors, knee extensors and flexors and ankle plantar flexors. Temporal measurements of an obstacle course comprising four gait tasks set at three challenging levels were taken. The relationship between strength and the obstacle course dependent measures was explored using linear regression models.
Significant associations (p&#8804;0.05) between all the strength measures and the gait performances were found. The correlation values between strength and obstructed gait (r = 0.356-0.554) and the percentage of the variance explained by strength (R2 = 13%-31%), increased as a function of the challenging levels, especially for the stepping over and on and off conditions.
While the difficulty of community older adults to negotiate obstacles cannot be attributed to a single causal pathway, the findings of the first study showed that strength is a critical requirement. That the magnitude of the association increased as a function of the challenging levels, suggests that interventions aimed at improving strength would potentially be effective in helping community older adults to negotiate environmental gait challenges.
In view of the findings of the first study, a second investigation determined the effectiveness of a progressive resistance-training program on obstructed gait tasks measured under specific laboratory conditions and on an obstacle course mimicking a number of environmental challenges. The time courses of strength gains and neuromuscular mechanisms underpinning the exercise-induced strength improvements in community-dwelling older adults were also investigated. The obstructed gait conditions included stepping over an obstacle, on and off a raised surface, across an obstacle and foot targeting.
Forty-three community-living adults with a mean age of 68 years (control =14 and experimental=29) completed a 24-week progressive resistance training program designed to improve strength and induce hypertrophy in the major muscles of the lower body. Specific laboratory gait kinetics and kinematics and temporal measures taken on the obstacle course were measured.  Lean tissue mass and muscle activation of the lower body muscle groups were assessed. The MVC strength of the knee extensors and 1-RM of the hip extension, hip flexion, knee extension, knee flexion and ankle plantar flexion were measured.
A 25% increase on the MVC of the knee extensors (p&#8804;0.05) was reported in the training group. Gains ranging between 197% and 285% were recorded for the 1-RM exercises in the trained subjects with significant improvements found throughout the study (p&#8804;0.05). The exercise-induced strength gains were mediated by hypertrophic and neural factors as shown by 8.7% and 27.7% increases (p&#8804;0.05) in lean tissue mass and integrated electromyographic activity, respectively. Strength gains were accompanied by increases in crossing velocity, stride length and reductions in stride duration, stance and swing time for all gait tasks except for the foot targeting condition. Specific kinematic variables associated with safe obstacle traverse such as vertical obstacle heel clearance, limb flexion, horizontal foot placements prior to and at post obstacle crossing and landing velocities resulted in an improved crossing strategy in the experimental subjects. Significant increases in the vertical and anterior-posterior ground reaction forces accompanied the changes in the gait variables.
While further long-term prospective studies of falls rates would be needed to confirm the benefits of lower limb enhanced strength, the findings of the present study provide conclusive evidence of significant improvements to gait efficiency associated with a systematic resistance-training program. It appears, however, that enhanced lower body strength has limited effects on gait tasks involving a dynamic balance component. In addition, due to the larger strength-induced increases in voluntary activation of the leg muscle compared to relatively smaller gains in lean tissue mass, neural adaptations appear to play a greater contributing role in explaining strength gains during the current resistance training protocol.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">exercise for older people</field><field name="subject">gait disorders in old age</field><field name="subject">gait</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">resistance training</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.101952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Action research in higher education: The advancement of university learning and teaching.</field><field name="creator">Zuber-Skerritt, Ortrun Dorothea</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to contribute to the improvement and advancement of university learning, teaching, and staff development; to integrate educational theory and the practice of university teaching; and to contribute to the establishment of a new, emerging paradigm in higher education. The strategy towards achieving these aims comprises (1) an alternative research methodology in the interpretive, non-positivist paradigm; (2) an integrated framework drawing on a variety of previously unrelated theories to form an alternative model of university education; and (3) reference to the dialectical relationship between educational theory and teaching practice and their integration through action research in higher education.
The thesis is not so much a critique of the traditional paradigm and of existing functionalist-structuralist approaches to higher education, but more a development and clarification of an alternative, dialectical, human action approach to higher education. The original contribution of this thesis to the theory and practice of higher education lies in the development (1) of an alternative model of university education based on an integration of previously unrelated domains of theory; (2) of a theoretical model of professional development as action research (the CRASP Model: Critical attitude, Research into teaching, Accountability, Self-evaluation, Professionalism); and (3) of action research projects in higher education.
Action research is research by the university teachers themselves into their teaching practice, i.e. into problems of the curriculum and student learning. The case studies included in and appended to this thesis show that in one educational setting at least it was possible to improve and advance university learning and teaching through action research. The evidence for this advancement is provided in a number of previously published case studies compiled in the Appendix.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">college teaching</field><field name="subject">university learning and teaching</field><field name="subject">staff development</field><field name="subject">educational theory</field><field name="subject">CRASP</field><field name="subject">critical attitude research into teaching accountability self-evaluation professional</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.102949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extending the workers' compensation act 1987 (N.S.W.) to include independent contractors and to allow more highly paid workers to insure fully their income, with particular reference to engineers.</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Brian Cleveland</field><field name="description">In mid-1987, the existing workers&#146; compensation system in New South Wales was replaced by a new Scheme, called &#145;WorkCover&#146;. While WorkCover solved a number of the financial problems that had plagued its predecessor, its enactment created other issues. Furthermore, WorkCover has failed to deal with a number of gaps in providing compensation for occupational injuries, most notably those suffered by independent contractors. By combining a study of aspects of industrial law and industrial relations, this thesis will examine some of those problems and gaps, in particular:
(a)    Should WorkCover be amended to enable independent contractors to come within its ambit?
(b)    Should there be additional insurance cover available (known as &#145;top-up&#146; insurance) to insure those parts of workers&#146; wages presently left unprotected by WorkCover?
(c)    Should workers be permitted to take out another form of &#145;top-up&#146; insurance to increase the quantum of death cover presently provided by the Scheme?
(d)    Should independent contractors who arc permitted to enter WorkCover also be permitted to obtain the extended cover set out in (b) and (c) above?
Where appropriate, the thesis compares WorkCover to the workers&#146; compensation schemes in other Australian jurisdictions. It develops each of the matters referred to above by referring to the results of the writer&#146;s survey of members of the Institution of Engineers (NSW Branch) which was conducted in May and June 1991.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Workers' Compensation Act 1987</field><field name="subject">workers compensation</field><field name="subject">law and legislation</field><field name="subject">engineers</field><field name="subject">highly paid workers</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.104134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate sustainability: Greenwash or a path to sustainable capitalism?</field><field name="creator">Traies, Samantha Jane</field><field name="description">The problems of unsustainable development and the increased-awareness of corporate power in the global era have contributed to an agenda of corporate citizenship. This thesis explores the meanings and practices that fall under the banner of the triple bottom line of corporate citizenship through forty-two in-depth interviews with representatives from the corporate sector and NGO sector (including trade unions) in Australia. This purposive sample includes a specific range of corporate industries and NGO types, all of which have involvement with various areas of sustainability. Interviewees described their feelings and experiences in relation to the concept of the triple bottom line, the potential and limitations of this type of sustainability and the purpose and impacts of partnerships between NGOs and the corporate sector.
On the basis of this research, this thesis argues that corporate citizenship is at best, a set of initiatives for making minor adjustments to the way companies perform their day-to-day operations and at worst, a program for improving corporate image rather than performance and for shifting the agenda of sustainable development toward corporate interests. While radical steps are required to achieve a sustainable society and environment, the terms of corporate citizenship offer very limited opportunities for change. The self-regulatory and market based model of citizenship does not challenge the impact of consumerism or the legitimacy of particular industry types and their products, except where threats are perceived to the longevity of the companies involved. Furthermore, while the exploitation of the environment and society has occurred as a result of corporate self-interest, corporate citizenship is justified on the same basis. The self-interest rationale and the tyranny of the economic bottom line in particular, substantially limit the fields of responsibility that can be included in the citizenship paradigm. While there are undoubtedly some well-intentioned corporate representatives who are working toward attaining a more
sustainable corporate culture, the discourse is primarily used to shift the sustainable development agenda toward corporate paradigms and interests.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">social responsibility of business</field><field name="subject">corporations</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">capitalism</field><field name="subject">corporate sustainability</field><field name="subject">corporate citizenship</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.105421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The energetics of interlimb coordination.</field><field name="creator">Lay, Brendan</field><field name="description">While the traditional dependent variables of motor skill learning are accuracy and consistency of movement outcome, there has been increasing interest in aspects of motor performance that are described as reflecting the &#145;energetics&#146; of motor behaviour. One defining characteristic of skilled motor performance is the ability to complete the task with minimum energy expenditure (Sparrow &amp; Newell, 1998). A further consideration is that movements also have costs in terms of cognitive &#145;effort&#146; or &#145;energy&#146;. The present project extends previous work on energy expenditure and motor skill learning within a coordination dynamics framework. From the dynamic pattern perspective, a coordination pattern lowest on the 11KB model potential curve (Haken, Kelso &amp; Bunz, 1985) is more stable and least energy is required to maintain pattern stability (Temprado, Zanone, Monno &amp; Laurent, 1999). Two experiments investigated the learning of stable and unstable coordination patterns with high metabolic energy demand.
An experimental task was devised by positioning two cycle ergometers side-by-side, placing one foot on each, with the pedals free to move independently at any metronome-paced relative phase, Experiment 1 investigated practice-related changes to oxygen consumption, heart rate, relative phase, reaction time and muscle activation (EMG) as participants practiced anti-phase, in-phase and 90&#176;-phase cycling. Across six practice trials metabolic energy cost reduced and AE and VE of relative phase declined. The trend in the metabolic and reaction time data and percent co-contraction of muscles was for the in-phase cycling to demonstrate the highest values, anti-phase the lowest and 90&#176;-phase cycling in-between. It was found that anti- and in-phase cycling were both kinematically stable but anti-phase coordination revealed significantly lower metabolic energy cost. It was, therefore, postulated that of two equally stable coordination patterns, that associated with lower metabolic energy expenditure would constitute a stronger attractor.
Experiment 2 was designed to determine whether a lower or higher energy-demanding coordination pattern was a stronger attractor by scanning the attractor layout at thirty-degree intervals from 0&#176; to 330&#176;. The initial attractor layout revealed that in-phase was most stable and accurate, but the remaining coordination patterns were attracted to the low energy cost anti-phase cycling. In Experiment 2 only 90&#176;-
phase cycling was practiced with a post-test attractor layout scan revealing that 90&#176;-phase and its symmetrical partner 270&#176;-phase had become attractors of other coordination patterns. Consistent with Experiment 1, practicing 90&#176;-phase cycling revealed a decline in AE and VE and a reduction in metabolic and cognitive cost. Practicing 90&#176;-phase cycling did not, however, destabilise the in-phase or anti-phase coordination patterns either kinematically or energetically.
In summary, the findings suggest that metabolic and mental energy can be considered different representations of a &#145;global&#146; energy expenditure or &#145;energetic&#146; phenomenon underlying human coordination. The hypothesis that preferred coordination patterns emerge as stable, low-energy solutions to the problem of inter-and intra-limb coordination is supported here in showing that the low-energy minimum of coordination dynamics is also an energetic minimum.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motor learning</field><field name="subject">human locomotion</field><field name="subject">energy metabolism</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">physiology aspects</field><field name="subject">coordination</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.111407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Situational and dispositional indicators of performance: Competing models in education.</field><field name="creator">Nielsen, Ingrid</field><field name="description">The attainment of high grades on the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) is critical to the future study and employment prospects of many Australian adolescents. Thus it is important to understand the factors that contribute to performance in the VCE. The aims of this study were twofold: the main aim was to test competing models of academic performance, subsuming a range of situational and dispositional variables based on a) self-efficacy theory, b) target and purpose goals, c) cognitive skills and self-regulatory strategies, and d) positive psychology. These models were each tested in terms of English performance and mathematics performance as these units contribute proportionally the most to overall VCE scores. In order to study whether pressures peculiar to the VCE impact on performance, the competing models were tested in a sample of Victorian students prior to the VCE (year 10) and then during the VCE (year 11). A preliminary study was conducted in order to develop and test four scales required for use in the major study, using an independent sample of 302 year nine students. The results indicated that these new scales were psychometrically reliable and valid. Three-hundred and seven Australian students participated in the year 10 and 11 study. These students were successively asked to provide their final years 9, 10 and 11 English and mathematics grades at times one, three and five and to complete a series of questionnaires at times two and four. Results of the year 10 study indicated that models based on self-efficacy theory were the best predictors of both English and mathematics performance, with high past grades, high self-efficacy and low anxiety contributing most to performance. While the year 10 self-efficacy models, target goal models, positive psychology models, self-regulatory models and cognitive skill based models were each robust in the sample in year 11, a substantial increase in explained variance was observed from year 10 to year 11 in the purpose goal models. Results indicated that students&#146; mastery goals and their performance-approach goals became substantially more predictive in the VCE than they were prior to the VCE. This result can be taken to suggest that these students responded in very instrumental ways to the pressures, and importance, of their VCE. An integrated model based on a combination of the variables from the competing models was also tested in the VCE. Results showed that these models were comparable, both in English and mathematics, to the self-efficacy models, but explained less variance than the purpose goal models. Thus in terms of parsimony the integrated models were not preferred. The implications of these results in terms of teaching practices and school counseling practices are discussed. It is recommended that students be encouraged to maintain a positive outlook in relation to their schoolwork and that they be encouraged to set their VCE goals in terms of a combination of self-referenced (mastery) and other-referenced (performance-approach) goals.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">prediction of scholastic success</field><field name="subject">Victorian certificate of education</field><field name="subject">VCE</field><field name="subject">self-rating of students</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.112422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the biology of four species of Dicranoloma.</field><field name="creator">Milne, Josephine</field><field name="description">Populations of Dicranoloma billardierei (Brid) Par., D. dicarpum (Nees.) Par., D. menziesii (Tayl.) Par. and D. platycaulon (C. Muell) Dix, from two pockets of cool temperate rainforest within the Yarra Ranges National Park (Cement Creek and Myrtle Loop), were sampled for a period of two years to establish their reproductive biology. The population dynamics within quadrats of D. billardierei, D. menziesii and D. platycaulon at Cement Creek also was investigated over a two year period, through the seasonal recording of shoot loss and/or gain,
The four species of Dicranoloma were dioicous and sexually dimorphic, with dwarf males epiphytic on the female plants. Antheridia were initiated before archegonia and required ca, 6 months to reach maturity, compared with 1 to 2 months for archegonia. More archegonia than antheridia occurred per inflorescence and were more variable Fertilization occurred during winter in D. billardierei and summer/ autumn in D. menziesii and D. platycaulon. The duration of the sporophyte cycle of D. menziesii was 12 months, shorter than that of D. billardierei and D. platycaulon which lasted for a period of 18 months to 2 years. In the latter two species an overlap of sporophyte generations occurred. This was particularly pronounced in D. billardierei as sporophytes remained in the swollen venter maturation stage for a period of 6 months. The duration of the sporophyte cycle could not be ascertained as few fruiting stems of D. dicarpum were found.
All four species of Dicranoloma regenerated from fragments cultured in the laboratory, and only two of the species showed evidence of production of asexual propagules in the field. Dicranoloma dicarpum was found to produce gemmae, an observation which had not been recorded before, and most of the leaves on stems of D. platycaulon had detached subulas.
Shoot loss was minimal in all four species, and when it did occur, (eg D. billardierei) it was attributed to disturbance by animals. Within quadrats there was an increase in shoot density which resulted from the development of innovation(s) and/or side branches rather than from the recruitment of new plants from spores or the regeneration of asexual propagules.
The four species of Dicranoloma investigated were robust, perennial mosses and formed an important component of the bryophytes found within the study area. Dicranoloma menziesii was the predominant species establishing on a variety of substrata, particularly as an epiphyte on Nothofagus cunninghamii The other species were more selective in their choice of substratum. Dicranoloma platycaulon was found exclusively on the trunks of myrtle beech and D. billardierei on fallen logs and exposed roots. Dicranoloma dicarpum which was not common, grew as an epiphyte on myrtle beech and on rocks.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mosses</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">Dicranoloma</field><field name="subject">Yarra Ranges National Park</field><field name="subject">Cement Creek Myrtle Loop</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.113817</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A common structural basis for central nervous system drug design.</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Edward John</field><field name="description">The main theme of this thesis is that there is a common structural basis for drugs acting on the central nervous system (CNS), and that this concept may be used to design new CNS-active drugs which have greater specificity and hence less side-effects.
To develop these ideas, the biological basis of how drugs modify CMS neurotransmission is described, and illustrated using dopaminergic pathways. An account is then given of the use of physicochemical concepts in contemporary drug design. The complete conformational analysis of several antipsychotic drugs is used to illustrate some of these techniques in the development of a model for antipsychotic drug action.
After reviewing current structure-activity studies in several classes of CNS drugs (antipsychotics, anti-depressants, stimulants, hal1ucinogens, anticonvulsants and analgesics), a hypothesis for a common structural basis of CNS drug action is proposed- This is based on a topographical comparison of the X-ray structures of eight representative CNS-active drugs, and consists of three parts: 1.there is a common structural basis for the activity of many different CNS-active drug classes; 2. an aromatic ring and a nitrogen atom are the primary binding groups whose topographical arrangement is fundamental to the activity of these drug classes; 
3. the nature and placement of secondary binding
determines different classes of CNS drug activity. A four-Point model for this common structural basis is then defined using 14- CNS-active drug structures that include the original eight used in proposing the hypothesis. The coordinates of this model are: R1 (0. 3.5, 0), R2 (0, -3.5, O), N (4.8. -0.3, 1.4), and R3 (6.3, 1.3, 0), where R1 and R2 represent the point locations of a hydrophobic interaction of the common aromatic ring with a receptor, and R3 locates the receptor point for a hydrogen bond involving the common nitrogen, N. Extended structures were used to define the receptor points R1, R2 and R3, and the complete conformational space of each of the 14 molecules was considered.
It is then shoun that the model may be used to predict whether a given structure is likely to show CNS activity: a search over 1,000 entries in the current Merck Index shows a high probability (82%) of CNS activity in compounds fitting the structural model.
Analysis of CNS neurotransmitters and neuropeptides shows that these fit the common model well. Based on the available evidence supporting chemical evolution, protein evolution, and the evolution of neurotransmitter functions, it is surmised that the aromatic ring/nitrogen atom pharmacophore proposed in the common model supports the idea of the evolution of CNS receptors and their neurotransmitters, possibly from an aromatic amine or acety1cho1ine acting as a primaeval communicating molecule.
The third point in the hypothesis trilogy is then addressed. The extensive conformation-activity analyses that have resulted in well-defined models for five separate CNS drug classes are used to map out the locations of secondary binding groups relative to the common model for anti-psychotics, antidepressants, analgesics, anticholinergics, and anticonvulsants. With this information, and knowledge derived from receptor-binding data, it is postulated that drugs having specified activity could be designed.
In order to generate novel structures having a high probability of CNS-activity, a process of drug design is described in which known CNS structures are superimposed topographically using the common model as a template. Atoms regarded as superfluous may be selectively deleted and the required secondary binding groups added in predicted locations to give novel structures.
It is concluded that this process provides the basis for the rational design of new lead compounds which could further be optimized for potent and specific CNS activity.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">central nervous system</field><field name="subject">effect of drugs</field><field name="subject">structure-activity relationships</field><field name="subject">psychotropic drugs</field><field name="subject">CNS drugs</field><field name="subject">central nervous system</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.115505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of milk protein catabolism by lactobacilli.</field><field name="creator">Broome, Malcolm Charles</field><field name="description">Lactobacillus plantarum and subspecies of Lactobacillus casei were isolated from good quality mature Cheddar cheese and characterized with respect to metabolic functions that would allow their use in cheesemaking. In this way microbiological control of the maturation process with particular emphasis on protein catabolism was achieved. The lactobacilli isolated were selected for low growth rates (and acid production) in milk, and low proteinase activity to allow for their addition in high numbers to cheesemilk together with the normal starter flora (group N streptococci).  The growth and acid production of the starter bacteria were unaffected by the presence of the lactobacilli during cheese manufacture and it was found that the added lactobacilli were able to grow and function under the conditions prevalent in Cheddar cheese during maturation. It was also demonstrated that the lactobacilli could be grown in an artificial medium to high numbers under controlled conditions and could be harvested for the preparation of cell concentrates, a necessary characteristic for commercialization. The lactobacilli also metabolized citrate, a potential problem in cheese maturation associated with C02 production but this did not adversely affect the maturation process under the conditions used.
Compared to the group N streptococci the non-starter lactobacilli possessed a proteinase system that had a higher temperature optimum and was less affected by heat and sodium chloride. They also possessed a more active peptidase system although both the lactobacilli and the starter organisms possessed a similar range of peptidases.
Non-starter lactobacilli were added to normal cheese and cheese made with proteinase negative starter. The added organisms did not adversely affect manufacturing parameters and did not metabolize citrate or lead to the formation of biogenic amines. However protein catabolism rates, particularly with respect to peptide degradation,
 
were increased, as was flavour development and intensity. It was observed that the body and texture of the cheeses was unaffected by the treatment. By controlling both the starter and non-starter microflora in the cheeses a practical system for favourably influencing cheese maturation was possible.
The investigation has demonstrated that carefully selected and characterized non-starter lactobacilli can be incorporated into Cheddar cheese manufacture in order to influence flavour development during maturation. Moreover the organisms can be added to the vat stage of manufacture without causing problems to the manufacturing process. This approach is a simple cost effective means of improving the cost of Cheddar cheese production and provides an unique opportunity to improve and control quality of all Cheddar cheese produced.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">milk proteins</field><field name="subject">lactic acid bacteria</field><field name="subject">cheese</field><field name="subject">microbioogy</field><field name="subject">lactobacillus</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.120502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The origins of inflated responsibility in obsessive compulsive disorder.</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Fiona Jane</field><field name="description">The pivotal role of inflated responsibility beliefs in the maintenance and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been clearly demonstrated (Rachman, 1993; Salkovskis, 1998; Shafran, 1997; van Oppen &amp; Arntz, 1994). Yet little is known about the origins of these beliefs, their contribution to a sense of inflated responsibility or the symptoms of OCD, or the contribution of personality to inflated responsibility and to OCD, The aims of this thesis were to investigate a model of the inter-relationships among the personality dimensions of neuroticism and psychoticism, inflated responsibility and OCD, and the origins of inflated responsibility to inflated responsibility and to OCD. In order to achieve these aims, a scale was developed to assess the origins of inflated responsibility based upon the five pathways proposed by Salkovskis, Shafran, Rachman, and Freeston (1999) and the additional domains of guilt, vigilance and thought-action fusion (Shafran, Thordarson, &amp; Rachman, 1996; Shafran, Watkins &amp; Charman, 1996; Tallis, 1994). Eighty-four participants with OCD (age M = 43.36) and 74 control participants (age M =37.14) volunteered to participate in the two studies of this thesis. The aim of Study 1 was to develop and validate a measure of the Origins of Inflated Responsibility (OIR). The results of the first study yielded a 25-ttem scale, the Origins of Inflated Responsibility Questionnaire (OIRQ) with five independent factors: responsibility, strictness, protection from responsibility, critical incidents, and peer blame which demonstrated both internal reliability and temporal stability over a 2-week period. In Study 2, participants also completed the Responsibility Attitudes Scale (Salkovskis, Wroe, Gledhill, Morrison, Forrester, Richards, ct al. (2000) (a measure of inflated responsibility), the Padua Inventory (Sanavio, 1988) (to measure of the symptoms of OCD)y and the Eysenck Personality Inventory-Revised (Eysenck &amp; Eysenck, 1991). Multivariatc Analysis of Variance revealed that the OCD group scored higher on all variables than the control group except for strictness where the groups were not different, and psychoticism where the OCD group scored lower. A series of Multiple Regression analyses revealed that both group and the OIR contributed to inflated responsibility (R2 = .56). When all variables, OIR, inflated responsibility and neuroticism were entered as predictors of OCD, 60% of the variance in OCD was explained however, 49% of the variance was shared by the independent variables suggesting the presence of some underlying construct. Structural Equation Modelling, where all the constructs in the model were examined simultaneously, revealed that neuroticism contributed to the OIR, inflated responsibility and OCD. The OIR were also significant predictors of inflated responsibility and indirectly through inflated responsibility predictive of OCD.  The OIR also directly predicted OCD and when the total effects are considered, their contribution was greater than the total effect for inflated responsibility alone. The results of these studies provide good support for the origins of inflated responsibility proposed by Salkovskis et al. (1999), as measured by the OIRQ developed for use in the current thesis. The results also support the contribution of inflated responsibility and neuroticism, as well as the OIR, to OCD, The large amount of variance shared by the OIR, inflated responsibility and neuroticism suggest that there might be some underlying construct, perhaps of a biopsychosocial nature, that requires further investigation for its role in the onset and maintenance of OCD. The clinical relevance
of these findings is discussed in terms of early prevention strategies and interventions.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obsessive-compulsive disorder</field><field name="subject">OCD</field><field name="subject">cognitive therapy</field><field name="subject">behavior therapy</field><field name="subject">Rachman</field><field name="subject">Salkovskis</field><field name="subject">Shafran</field><field name="subject">van Oppen</field><field name="subject">Arntz</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.121410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feminist poetics: Symbolism in an emblematic journey reflecting self and vision.</field><field name="creator">d'Esterre, Elaine</field><field name="description">My thesis tilled Feminist Poetics: Symbolism in an Emblematic Journey Reflecting Self and Vision, consists of thirty oil paintings on canvas, several preparatory sketches and drawings in different media on paper, and is supported and elucidated by an exegesis. The paintings on unframed canvases reveal mise en sc&#232;nes and emblems that present to the viewer a drama about links between identities, differences, relationships and vision. Images of my daughter, friends and myself fill single canvases, suites of paintings, diptyches and triptychs. The impetus behind my research derives from my recognition of the cultural means by which women's experience is excluded from a representational norm or ideal.
I use time-honoured devices, such as, illusionist imagery, aspects of portraiture, complex fractured atmospheric space, paintings and drawings within paintings, mirrors and reflective surfaces, shadows and architectural devices. They structure my compositions in a way that envelops the viewer in my internal world of ideas. Some of these features function symbolically, as emblems. A small part of the imagery relies on verisimilitude, such as my hands and their shadow and my single observing eye enclosed by my glasses. What remains is a fantasy world, &#145;seen&#146; by the image of my other eye, or &#145;faction&#146;, based on memories and texts explaining the significance of ancient Minoan symbols.
In my paintings, I base the subjects of this fantasy on my memories of the Knossos Labyrinth and matristic symbols, such as the pillar, snake, blood, eye and horn. They suggest the presence of a ritual where initiates descended into the adyton (holy of holies) or sunken areas in the labyrinth. The paintings attempt a &#145;rewriting&#146; of sacrality and gender by adopting the symbolism of death, transformation and resurrection in the adyton. The significance of my emblematic imagery is that it constructs a foundation narrative about vision and insight.
I sought symbolic attributes shared by European oil painting and Minoan antiquity. Both traditions share symbolic attributes with male dying gods in Greek myths and Medusa plays a central part in this linkage. I argue that her attributes seem identical to both those of the dying gods and Minoan goddesses. In the Minoan context these symbols suggest metaphors for the female body and the mother and daughter blood line. When the symbols align with the beheaded Medusa in a patriarchal context, both her image and her attributes represent cautionary tales about female sexuality that have repercussions for aspects of vision. In Renaissance and Baroque oil painting Medusa's image served as a vehicle for an allegory that personified the triumph of reason over the senses. In the twentieth century, the vagina dentata suggests her image, a personified image of irrational emotion that some male Surrealists celebrated as a muse. She is implicated in the male gaze as a site of castration and her representation suggests a symbolic form pertaining to perspective. Medusa's image, its negative sexual and violent connotations, seemed like a keystone linking iconographic codes in European oil painting to Minoan antiquity.
I fused aspects of matristic Minoan antiquity with elements of European oil paintings in the form of disguised attribute gestures, objects and architectural environments. I selected three paintings, D&#252;rer's Setf-Portrait, 1500, Gentileschi's Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting, 1630 and Velazquez's Las Meniruis, 1656 as models because 1 detected echoes of Minoan symbolism in the attributes of their subjects and backgrounds. My revision of Medusa's image by connecting it to Minoan antiquity established a feminist means of representation in the largely male-dominated tradition of oil painting. These paintings also suggested painting techniques that were useful to me.
Through my representations of my emblematic journey I questioned the narrow focus placed on phallic symbols when I explored how their meanings may have been formed within a matricentric culture. I retained the key symbols of the patriarchal foundation narratives about vision but removed images of violence and their link to desire and replaced it with a ritual form of symbolic death. I challenged the binary oppositional defined Self as opposed to Other by constructing a complex, fluid Self that interacts with others. A multi-directional gaze between subjects, viewers and artist replaces the male gaze.
Different qualities of paint, coagulation and random flow form a blood symbolism. Many layers of paint retaining some aspects of the Gaze and Glance, fuse and separate intermittently to construct and define form. The sense of motion and fluidity constructs a form of multi-faceted selves.
The supporting document, the exegesis is in two parts. In the first part, I discuss the Minoan sources of my iconography and the symbolic gender specific meanings suggested by particular symbols and their changed meanings in European oil painting, I explain how I integrate Minoan symbols into European oil paintings as a form of disguised symbolism. In the second part I explain how my alternative use of symbolism and paint alludes to a feminist poetic.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminist art criticism</field><field name="subject">symbolism in art</field><field name="subject">minoan art</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.123532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inspiration and Mimesis in Plato's criticism of poetry.</field><field name="creator">Pellis, Vivien C</field><field name="description">Plato criticizes poetry in several of his dialogues, beginning with Apology, his first work, and ending with Laws, his last. In these dialogues, his criticism of poetry can be divided into two streams: poetry is criticized for either being divinely inspired, or because it is mimetic or imitative of reality. However, of the dialogues which criticize poetry in these ways, it is not until Laws that Plato mentions both inspiration and mimesis together, and then it is only in a few sentences. Furthermore, nowhere in the dialogues does Plato discuss their relationship. This situation has a parallel in the secondary literature. While much work has been done on inspiration or mimesis in Plato&#146;s criticism of poetry, very little work exists which discusses the connection between them. This study examines Plato&#146;s treatment - in the six relevant dialogues - of these two poetic elements, inspiration and mimesis, and shows that a relationship exists between them. Both can be seen to relate to two important Socratic-Platonic concerns: the care of the soul and the welfare of the state. These concerns represent a synthesis of Socratic moral philosophy with Platonic political beliefs. In the &#145;inspiration&#146; dialogues, Ion, Apology, Meno, Phaedrus and Laws, poetic inspiration can affect the Socratic exhortation which considers the care of the individual soul. Further, as we are told in Apology, Crito and Gorgias, it is the good man, the virtuous man - the one who cares for his soul - who also cares for the welfare of the state. Therefore, in its effect on the individual soul, poetic inspiration can also indirectly affect the state. In the &#145;mimesis&#146; dialogues, Republic and Laws, this same exhortation, on the care of the soul, is posed, but it is has now been rendered into a more Platonic form - as either the principle of specialization - the &#145;one man, one job&#146; creed of Republic, which advances the harmony between the three elements of the soul, or as the concord between reason and emotion in Laws. While in Republic, mimesis can damage the tripartite soul's delicate balance, in Laws, mimesis in poetry is used to promote the concord. Further, in both these dialogues, poetic mimesis can affect the welfare of the state. In Republic, Socrates notes that states arc but a product of the individuals of which they are composed Therefore, by affecting the harmony of the individual soul, mimesis can then undermine the harmony of the state, and an imperfect political system, such as a timarchy, an oligarchy, a democracy, or a tyranny, can result. However, in Laws, when it is harnessed by the philosophical lawgivers, mimesis can assist in the concord between the rulers and the ruled, thus serving the welfare of the state. Inspiration and mimesis can thus be seen to be related in their effect on the education of both the individual, in the care of the soul, and the state, in its welfare. Plato's criticism of poetry, therefore, which is centred on these two features, addresses common Platonic concerns: in education, politics, ethics, epistemology and psychology.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plato</field><field name="subject">contributions in poetics</field><field name="subject">criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">poetics</field><field name="subject">inspiration in literature</field><field name="subject">Mimesis in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.124541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Firms as adaptive organizations: The case of Australian trading banks.</field><field name="creator">Tabart-Gay, Julie</field><field name="description">The conventional accounting notion of &#145;going concern&#146; &#151; that a firm will continue its business operations in the same manner indefinitely &#151; has underpinned accounting practice for over one hundred years. This idea has provided a rationale for spreading costs over accounting periods and for deferring costs as assets in balance sheets.
An alternative idea that is widely regarded as reliable in the literatures of economics and deliberate action is that firms continually adapt to changes in market and economic conditions. That is economic behaviour. The implications of that view of a firm for accounting have been systematically explored by Chambers (1966). While not examining those particular implications, many other accounting theorists have been critical of the conventional accounting idea of 'going concern' and of its impact on accounting practice.
The two notions of &#145;going concern&#146; - as static or adaptive enterprises - are examined by referring to the business operations of the four major Australian trading banks over the period 1983-1991. Banks were selected because they are commonly thought to be particularly &#145;conservative&#146; organizations. The period 1983&#151;1991 was chosen because it covers the era of deregulation of the Australian financial system.
The evidence adduced by this study indicates that the Australian trading banks have continually adapted their organizational structures and business operations in the light of changes in technology, markets for financial services, government policies and domestic and global economic conditions. Illustrations of adaptive behaviour by banks ate drawn from their normal operating procedures such as the provision of products and services, loan services, acquisitions, sale of property, non-core banking operations and international banking.
It is argued on analytical grounds that the cost basis of accounting does not yield financial statements that provide factual and up-to-date information about the financial capacity of firms to pay their debts and to continue trading generally; that is, to be going concerns. At any time, those financial capacities are determined by the amount of money commanded by a firm, including the money's worth of its assets, and by its level of debt. It is concluded on empirical grounds that the Australian trading banks, at least, are adaptive entities.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bank management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">going concerns</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.142733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exposure to fumes and gases during welding operations.</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Robert Allan</field><field name="description">The exposure to fumes and gases is one of the hazards associated with welding operations. Apart from research conducted on the mechanism of fume and gas formation and the relationship between fume formation rates and common welding parameters, little is known about the exposure process during welding.
This research project aimed to identify the factors that influence exposure, develop an understanding of their role in the exposure process and through this understanding formulate strategies for the effective control of exposure during welding. To address these aims a literature review and an experimental program was conducted The literature review surveyed epidemiological, toxicological and exposure data. The experimental program involved three approaches, the first, an evaluation of the factors that influence exposure by assessing a metal inert gas/mild steel welding process in a workshop setting. The second approach involved the study of exposure in a controlled environment provided by a wind tunnel and simulated welding process. The final approach was to investigate workplace conditions through an assessment of exposure and control strategies in industry.
The exposure to fumes and gases during welding is highly variable and frequently in excess of the health based exposure standards. Exposure is influenced by a number of a factors including the welding process, base material, arc time, electrode, arc current, arc voltage, arc length, electrode polarity, shield gas, wire-to-metal-work distance (metal inert gas), metal transfer mode, intensity of the UV radiation (ozone), the frequency of arc ignitions (ozone), thermal buoyancy generated by the arc process, ventilation (natural and mechanical), the welding environment, the position of the welder, the welders stance, helmet type, and helmet position. Exposure occurs as a result of three processes: the formation of contaminants at or around the arc region; their transport from the arc region, as influenced by the entry and thermal expansion of shield gases, the vigorous production of contaminants, thermal air currents produced by the heat of the arc process, and ventilation; and finally the entry of contaminants into the breathing zone of the welder, as influenced by the position of the welder, the welders stance, helmet type, and the helmet position. The control of exposure during welding can be achieved by several means: through the selection of welding parameters that generate low contaminant formation rates; through the limitation of arc time; and by isolating the breathing zone of the welder from the contaminant plume through the use of ventilation, welder position or the welding helmet as a physical barrier. Effective control is achieved by careful examination of the workplace, the selection of the most appropriate control option, and motivation of the workforce.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">welding</field><field name="subject">safety measures</field><field name="subject">equipment and supplies</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.143604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using site as the medium of image-making at Tower Hill.</field><field name="creator">Stretch, Eleanor Eunice</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">landscapes in art</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Tower Hill</field><field name="subject">pictorial works</field><field name="subject">exhibitions</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050902.144857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the biology of the abalone Haliotis Laevigata and Haliotis Scalaris.</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Scoresby Arthur</field><field name="description">The abalone Haliotis laevigata Donovan is commercially exploited in southern Australia; Haliotis scalaris Leach is a smaller, noncommercial species. This thesis describes the early life history of both species and other aspects of the fishery biology of H. Iaevigata required for fishery management.
Both abalone species recruit onto a crustose coralline substratum variously from spring to winter. After settlement the growth rate of both species Is linear for a number of years (1 .7mm/month for H. Iaevigata and 1.1mm/month for H. scalaris) . Crustose coralline algae are the main food during the first year of life but thereafter the diet switches largely to drift algae and seagrass. Survival of newly-settled cohorts differed between years and between species. Overall, it appeared to be density Independent at low densities but density-dependent at high densities,
Recruitment strength (measured at 2-1/2 - 3 years of age) and natural mortality of adults in a closed population was measured over 17 years at West I. There were sequences of strong and weak recruitments, but no relationship with presumed spawning stock size was apparent. Adult natural mortality rates ranged from 0.02 to 0.86 and were strongly density dependent. Stingrays were a major, and octopuses a minor, cause of mortality.
The fecundity of H. Iaevigata was investigated at a number of sites and was adequately described by linear regressions of fecundity on total weight. Fecundity ratios and growth rate differed between sites and fecundity appears subject to phenotyplc and genotypic variation.
The short and long term movement of H. laevigata was also examined, !n short term studies sexually mature Individuals aggregate during the spawning season but disperse randomly at other times of the year.

The broadest brush that could be applied to my work is that it concerns Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE), that it focuses on aspects of professional socialisation, and that it involves various case studies utilising naturalistic inquiry. Whilst it would be impossible and naive to believe that the reading of these texts will produce the meanings that I encourage, or have internalised, nevertheless the order of reading is at least something that I can argue for. Read in the order I suggest throughout the thesis I am hopeful that my subjectivities, and the learning and understandings I have reached may become clear.
The purpose of this two part thesis is an exploration of the interplay or dialectic that exists between PETE students, academic staff and the subject matter within PETE. I have had to come to understand the limitations and advantages of insider research as the work has been completed at my University in the School of Human Movement and Sports Science where I have worked for twenty years. This thesis examines the extent to which studentship and oppositional behaviour underlies the dialectic that exists between the students and the various discourses within the program. I have written the study in two very different formats, one, a collection of stories about PETE and the other, an interpretative case study conducted during 1993 and 1994. Within the case study, studentship and oppositional behaviour were viewed as a measure of the extent to which students react and push against the forces of socialisation within their PETE program that is seen to represent dominant discourses,
The following broad research questions were considered to enable the above analysis.
1. What is the nature of studentship and oppositional behaviour in a high status subject within PETE compared to a subject that is seen by students to be of little relevance and of low status?
2. How are studentship and oppositional behaviour related to students subjective warrants?
3. How are the studentship and oppositional behaviours exhibited by students related to the pedagogy and discourses reflected in the knowledge, beliefs and practices within the two sites.
The starting point for this research was a study conducted as a totally separate research task (Swan, 1992) that investigated the hierarchies of subject knowledge
 
within a PETE site and investigated the influence of such hierarchies upon student intention. A great deal of meta analysis exists about the manner in which a technocratic rationality pervades PETE but very little case study material of what this means to students and academic staff within such institutions is available. The stories in Between The Rings And Under The Gym Mat, which is the second part of this thesis, represent &#145;the data&#146; differently from the case study, but they speak their own truth. At times the nature of the story is indistinguishable from the reality of the case study. Wexler (1992) undertook an ethnographic study about identity formation in three very different high schools, and published the findings in a book entitled Becoming Somebody. His introductory words about the nature of the social story he tells, are significant to this study and story.
Social history is recounted by creative intervention that can only be made from culturally accessible materials. Ethnography is neither an objective realist, nor subjective imaginist account. Rather, it is an historical artefact that is mediated by elaborated distancing of culturally embedded and internally contradictory (but seemingly independent and coherent) concepts that take on a life of their own as theory. So, this is not &#145;news from nowhere,&#146; but a theoretically structured story where both the story and its structure are part of my times. (p.6)
The case study before you is organised with an analysis of studentship and oppositional behaviour detailed in chapter one. The following chapter conceptualises studentship and oppositional behaviour in relation to particular themes of professional socialisation, resistance to oppression and youth culture. Chapter three locates the case study to the major paradigmatic debates about the value and nature of the subject matter content within PETE, Chapter four outlines the case site, the research process and the research dilemma&#146;s confronted in this study. The remaining three chapters are the case record as I can best understand it.
In Between the Rings and under the Gym Mat (part B) the story most directly concerned with studentship and oppositional behaviour, is called Tale of Two Classes&#146;. It takes on a very different reality to the case study (part A) and much can be said about the reality of lived experience which can be portrayed in narrative form as opposed to a clinical case study. Many of the other stories pose similar images that are contradictory and never quite complete. I have written a separate methodological section for the narrative stories. It is my intention that the case study and the series of
 
stories should be viewed as essentially complementary, but also a discrete representation of a part of PETE.
As part of the Ed D program I have undertaken four discrete research tasks as the starting point for this research I have referred to the first one (Hierarchies of Subject knowledge within PETE). I also undertook an action research project about &#145;Teaching Poorly by Choice.&#146; A further piece of research was a somewhat reflective effort to draw together what this has all meant to me from a subjective and reflexive perspective. Such efforts are often seen as being self indulgent, as subjectivity in the form of lived experience sits uneasily in academia. A final paper involved an evaluation of Between the Rings and Under the Gym Mat from a pedagogical perspective by PETE professionals around the world. And that's the way things turned out.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">physical education</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="subject">physical education teachers</field><field name="subject">PETE</field><field name="subject">Physical education teacher education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.101453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving primary school health education through action research: A case study</field><field name="creator">Landers, Denise</field><field name="description">Limited research has been conducted concerning the actual practice of health education in Victorian schools.
This study investigates the health education curriculum at a large primary school in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The investigation involves a critical analysis of current practices in health education in the upper school through the development of a &#145;small&#146; action research group. Data were gathered through document collection, questionnaires, interviews, discussions, diary and reflective journal entries.
The action research group, consisting of the teacher-researcher and upper school teachers, developed, implemented and reflected upon units of work piloted with upper school students. Alternative approaches to health education were explored. The aim was to accommodate critically informed discourse amongst colleagues to promote self-reflective enquiry and facilitate improvements to existing pedagogic practices.
During the course of the investigation, factors limiting and facilitating action research and curriculum change in health education, became evident. These included personal, practical, curriculum and organisational constraints operating externally and internally on the school and classroom environments. Despite these constraints, it was demonstrated in this study, that action research can contribute to the improvement of pedagogic practices in health education. Small &#145;authentic&#146; action research projects may provide alternative internal professional development structures for teachers and consequently improve learning opportunities for students.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health education</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">action research in education</field><field name="subject">health education</field><field name="subject">curricula</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.102258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music in state-supported schooling in South Australia to 1920.</field><field name="creator">Southcott, Jane Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the establishment of the music curriculum in state-supported schools in South Australia from the beginnings of such schooling until 1920. There will be a discussion of issues to be explored and the method by which this investigation will proceed. A literature survey of relevant research will be included, after which there will be a sketch of the development of state-supported schooling in South Australia. Several broad themes have been chosen as the means of organising the historical material: the rationales offered for the inclusion of music in schooling, the methodologies, syllabi and materials of such music instruction, the provisions for teacher training in music, both preservice and as professional development for established teachers, and the place and function of music in schooling. Each of these themes will form the framework for a chronological narrative. Comparisons will be made with three neighbouring colonies/States concerning each of these themes and conclusions will be drawn. Finally, overall conclusions will be made concerning the initial contentions raised in this chapter in the light of the data presented.
Although this study is principally concerned with the establishment of music in state-supported schooling, there will be a brief consideration of the colony of South Australia from its proclamation in 1836. The music pedagogical context that prevailed at that time will be discussed and this will, of necessity, include developments that occurred before 1836. The period under consideration will close in 1920, by which time the music curriculum for South Australia was established, and the second of the influential figures in music education was at his zenith. At this time there was a new school curriculum in place which remained essentially unchanged for several decades.
As well as the broad themes identified, this thesis will investigate several contentions as it attempts to chronicle and interpret the establishment and development of music in state-supported schooling in South Australia up to 1920. The first contention of this thesis is that music in state-supported schooling, once established, did not change significantly from its inception throughout the period under consideration. In seeking a discussion of the existence and importance of the notion of an absence of change or stasis, the theory of punctuated equilibria, which identifies stasis as the norm in the evolutionary growth of species, will be employed as an insightful analogy. It should be recognised that stasis exists, should be expected and may well be the prevailing norm.
The second contention of this thesis is that advocates were and continue to be crucial to the establishment and continued existence of music in state-supported schooling. For change to occur there must be pressure through such agencies as motivated individuals holding positions of authority, and thus able to influence the educational system and its provisions. The pedagogical method introduced into an educational system is often that espoused by the acknowledged advocate. During the period under consideration there were two significant advocates for music in state-supported schools.
The third contention of this thesis is that music was used in South Australia, as in the other colonies/States, as an agent of social reform, through the selection of repertoire and the way in which music was employed in state-supported schooling. Music was considered inherently uplifting. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the music selected for school singing carried texts with messages deemed significant by those who controlled the education system. The repertoire was not that of the receiving class but came from a middle class tradition of fully notated art music in which correct performance and notational reading were emphasised. A sweet, pure vocal tone was desired, as strident, harsh, speaking tones were perceived as a symptom of incipient larrikinism which was not desired in schooling. Music was seen as a contributor to good order and discipline in schooling.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music in education</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">public schools</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">instruction and study</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.104134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Giorgio de Chirico and the idea of enigmatic imagery: The innocence of becoming.</field><field name="creator">Walker, Deborah</field><field name="description">My paintings emerge from within a context best explained by reference to Nietzsche's perspectivism. That is an intellectual attitude that deprivileges rationalism and accommodates scepticism or unknowing as an acceptable starting point From this standpoint art/language can be seen as being in a state of becoming rather than as representing a state of being. This thesis aims to demonstrate, not only by a philosophical encounter with Giorgio de Chirico's work: ie. his use of myth, his Nietzschean perspectivism and his enigmatic interpretation of figuration, that the most helpful context and understanding of my work can be realied. De Chirico's art, like Nietzsche's philosophy seeks in its processes to explore the possible unity of Dionysian aesthetic force with the Apollonian. Neither Nietzsche nor de Chirico considered within a post-Socratic world that this unity was realizable. Nevertheless they both share in their respective art forms a need to represent the relentless struggle to enact the disjunction of the two aesthetic forces in a secular world. The artist&#146;s enigmatic imagery is characterized by a consideration of appearance and reality and it is for this reason that the work was selected as a model for investigating the nature of enigma. His use of seemingly straightforward, ordinary images suggests a sense of accessibility, yet at the same time they are irreducible to knowing and my own image-making was greatly expanded by investigating these concerns. I am not arguing that de Chirico was influenced by Nietzsche but instead that Nietzsche's philosophical point of view and his use of poetic language to express these views lay in discovering the qualities and substance of the Dionysian spirit As well as working within a Nietzschean world-view set out in The Birth of Tragedy,  de Chirico has also drawn on the Italian unification, specifically the Risorgimento and the lineage of these political and mythical figures were endemic to his art and they interface the with his use of the Apollonian-Dionysian disunity first explored by Nietzsche. The focus of the exegesis will be to present the poetic and philosophical use made of the latter in de Chirico&#146;s art It is anticipated that this philosophical encounter with the aesthetic, social and political world of de Chirico will, not only assist in interpreting his life's work anew, but will also provide a context in which my paintings of enigma might be interpreted.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Giorgio De Chirico</field><field name="subject">Freidrich Wilhelm Nietzsche</field><field name="subject">criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">contributions in art and architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.104950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australia and East Timor: elitism, pragmatism and the national interest.</field><field name="creator">Hoyle, Maxwell Bruce</field><field name="description">For over two decades the issue of East Timor's right to self-determination has been a &#145;prickly&#146; issue in Australian foreign policy. The invasion by Indonesian forces in 1975 was expected, as Australian policy-makers had been well informed of the events leading up to the punitive action being taken. Indeed, prior discussions involving the future of the territory were held between the Australian Prime Minister and the Indonesian President in 1974. In response to the events unfolding in the territory the Australian Labor Government at the time was presented with two policy options for dealing with the issue. The Department of Defence recommended the recognition of an independent East Timor; whereas the Department of Foreign Affairs proposed that Australia disengage itself as far as possible from the issue. The decision had ramifications for future policy considerations especially with changes in government. With the Department of Foreign Affairs option being the prevailing policy what were the essential ingredients that give explanation for the government's choice?
It is important to note the existence of the continuity and cyclical nature of attitudes by Labor governments toward Indonesia before and after the invasion. To do so requires an analysis of the influence &#145;Doc&#146; Evatt had in shaping any possible Labor tradition in foreign policy articulation. The support given by Evatt for the decolonisation of the Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia) gave rise to the development of a special relationship-so defined. Evidence of the effect Evatt had on future Labor governments may be found in the opinions of Gough Whitlam.  In 1975 when he was Prime Minister, Whitlam felt the East Timor issue was merely the finalisation of Indonesia's decolonisation honouring Evatt's long held anti-colonialist tradition existing in the Australian Labor Party. The early predisposition toward Indonesia's cohesiveness surfaced again in the Hawke and Keating Labor governments of later years. It did not vary a great deal with changes in government
The on-going commitment to preserving and strengthening the bilateral relationship meant Indonesia's territorial integrity became the focus of the Australian political elites&#146; regional foreign policy determinations. The actions taken by policy-makers served to promote the desire for a stable region ahead of independence claims of the East Timorese. From a realist perspective, the security dilemma for Australian policy-makers was how to best promote regional order and stability in the South East Asian region. The desire for regional cohesiveness and stability continues to drive Australian political elites to promote policies that gives a priority to the territorial integrity of regional states. Indonesia, in spite of its diversity, was only ever thought of as a cohesive unitary state and changes to its construct have rarely been countenanced. Australia's political elite justifications for this stance vacillate between strategic and economic considerations, ideological (anti-colonialism) to one of being a pragmatic response to international politics.
The political elite argues the projection of power into the region is in Australia&#146;s national interest. The policies from one government to the next necessarily see the national interest as being an apparent fixed feature of foreign policy. The persistent fear of invasion from the north traditionally motivated Australia's political elite to adopt a strategic realist policy that sought to &#145;shore up&#146; the stability, strength and unity of Indonesia. The national interest was deemed to be at risk if support for East Timorese independence was given. The national interest though can involve more than just the security issue, and the political elite when dealing with East Timor assumed that they were acting in the common good. Questions that need to be addressed include determining what is the national interest in this context? What is the effect of a government invoking the national interest in debates over issues in foreign policy? And, who should participate in the debate? In an effort to answer these questions an analysis of how the ex-foreign affairs mandarin Richard Woolcott defines the national interest becomes crucial.
Clearly, conflict in East Timor did have implications for the national interest. The invasion of East Timor by Indonesia had the potential to damage the relationship, but equally communist successes in 1975 in Indo-China raised Australia's regional security concerns. During the Cold War, the linking of communism to nationalism was driving the decision-making processes of the Australian policy-makers striving to come to grips with the strategic realities of a changing region. Because of this, did the constraints of world politics dominated by Cold War realities combined with domestic political disruption have anything to do with Australia's response?
Certainly, Australia itself was experiencing a constitutional crisis in late 1975. The Senate had blocked supply and the Labor Government did not have the funds to govern. The Governor-General by dismissing the Labor Government finally resolved the impasse. What were the reactions of the two men charged with the responsibility of forming the caretaker government toward Indonesia's military action? And, could the crisis have prevented the Australian government from making a different response to the invasion?
Importantly, and in terms of economic security, did the knowledge of oil and gas deposits thought to exist in the Timor Sea influence Australia's foreign policy? The search for oil and gas requires a stable political environment in which to operate. Therefore for exploration to continue in the Timor Sea Australia must have had a preferred political option and thoughts of with whom they preferred to negotiate. What was the extent of each government's cooperation and intervention in the oil and gas industry and could any involvement have influenced the Australian political elites&#146; attitude toward the prospect of an independent East Timor? Australia's subsequent de jure recognition that East Timor was part of Indonesia paved the way for the Timor Gap (Zone of Cooperation) Treaty signing in 1989. The signing underpinned Australia's acceptance of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.
The outcome of the analysis of the issues that shaped Australia's foreign policy toward East Timor showed that the political elite became locked into an integration model, which was defended by successive governments. Moreover, they formed an almost reflexive defence of Indonesia both at the domestic and international level.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foreign relations</field><field name="subject">East Timor</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Gough Whitlam</field><field name="subject">Labor governments</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Australian Labor Party</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.110809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of real and functional analysis to solve boundary value problems.</field><field name="creator">Duong, Thanh-Binh</field><field name="description">This thesis is about using appropriate tools in functional analysis arid classical analysis to tackle the problem of existence and uniqueness of nonlinear partial differential equations. There being no unified strategy to deal with these equations, one approaches each equation with an appropriate method, depending on the characteristics of the equation.
The correct setting of the problem in appropriate function spaces is the first important part on the road to the solution. Here, we choose the setting of Sobolev spaces. The second essential part is to choose the correct tool for each equation.
In the first part of this thesis (Chapters 3 and 4) we consider a variety of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations with mixed boundary and initial conditions. The methods of compactness and monotonicity are used to prove existence and uniqueness of the solution (Chapter 3). Finding a priori estimates is the main task in this analysis. For some types of nonlinearity, these estimates cannot be easily obtained, arid so these two methods cannot be applied directly. In this case, we first linearise the equation, using linear recurrence (Chapter 4).
In the second part of the thesis (Chapter 5), by using an appropriate tool in functional analysis (the Sobolev Imbedding Theorem), we are able to improve previous results on a posteriori error estimates for the finite element method of lines applied to nonlinear parabolic equations. These estimates are crucial in the design of adaptive algorithms for the method, and previous analysis relies on, what we show to be, unnecessary assumptions which limit the application of the algorithms. Our analysis does not require these assumptions.
In the last part of the thesis (Chapter 6), staying with the theme of choosing the most suitable tools, we show that using classical analysis in a proper way is in some cases sufficient to obtain considerable results. We study in this chapter nonexistence of positive solutions to Laplace's equation with nonlinear Neumann boundary condition. This problem arises when one wants to study the blow-up at finite time of the solution of the corresponding parabolic problem, which models the heating of a substance by radiation. We generalise known results which were obtained by using more abstract methods.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">differential equations</field><field name="subject">boundary value problems</field><field name="subject">classical analysis</field><field name="subject">Sobolev spaces</field><field name="subject">equations</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.111630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pappadums in paradise?  Journeys of Indian migrant women to Australia.</field><field name="creator">Kannan, Sharmini</field><field name="description">The blue glass is always the hardest to find. On the beach you catch the waves bringing back the glass from forgotten tossed bottles, frosted green, clear, or mottled pale brown. But the blue glass - that's the real thing.
I search for days without finding any. Sometimes there are slivers; other days, small chunks. Like a beachcomber, I comb the sands for it.
I take the glass home and make some into jewellery and touchstones for people to hang on to; pour essential oils on others so the scents waft heavenward and meld together with the glass to form a bond.
Words are like that. They can fuse with each other and ignite, or just quietly combine, On sunny days, I take my books with me to the beach. I toss words back and
forth in my mind, like churning waves. I cobble them together, A phrase here. A sentence there.
The water. The sun. The sand. The glass. The words. The paper. The Connection.  I find myself enveloped in it all.
The glass is from bottles tossed into the surf by unthinking people - picnickers, vacationers, those who don't have to return here and live with the remnants of their actions. Over time, the broken glass is ground and moulded by the action of the waves; the sharp edges are softened and etched by the sand and water, The sea glass is washed up on shore and picked up by beachcombers. Some recycle it for other uses like me; others just keep it as a reminder of a day at the beach. 
The words I sift through as I sit on the sand are measured in the sea glass. I pick each word up and look through it to see how much light shines through. What use do 1 have for it? A poem? An essay? A fragment of a sentence, for something to be said in the future? I watch the sun rest uneasily on its bed of water and slide slowly, farther down. I know the hot summer is coming to a close and I am loath to let go of the closeness I feel with nature.
I live to find the blue glass, and sometimes it just happens.
My search for Indian migrant women was like my quest for the blue glass. It was not an easy task. It became a process of rummaging through other people's lives, searching for fragments and relics.  Eventually I was able to fit pieces together to form a mosaic of their lives in that other time, that other place. And also in this present time, in this place they now call home, Australia.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women immigrants</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.113531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Folate fortification: A case study of public health policy-making.</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, Mark Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the use of scientific evidence in the process of making public health policy. A case study located within a food regulation setting is used. The aim is to test theory against this case study. The outcome is a theoretical understanding of the use of scientific evidence in the policy-making process in a food regulation setting.
Food regulation can influence food composition and food labelling and thereby affect the population's dietary intake. Frequently there are contested values, beliefs, ideologies and interests among stakeholders regarding the use of food regulation as a policy instrument to effect public health outcomes. The protection of public health and safety, taking into account evidence based practice, is generally employed by food regulators as the priority objective during the policy-making process to adjudicate among the competing expectations of stakeholders. However, this policy objective has not been clearly defined and is vulnerable to interpretation and application.
The process by which folate fortification policy was made in Australia, in response to epidemiological evidence of a relationship between folate intake during the periconceptional period and reduced risk of neural tube defects, was analysed as a case study of the policy-making process. The folate fortification policy created a precedent for both food fortification and subsequently health claims policy in Australia. A social constructivist method was used to analyse the case study. The method involved deconstructing the food regulatory system into three levels; decision-making process; procedural; and political environment. Data aligned with each level of analysis was collected from 22 key informant interviews, documentary sources, field notes and surveys of both a random sample of the Australian population's knowledge of folate and use of folic acid-containing supplements (n = 5422), and the implementation of folate fortified food products into stores (n = 60).
The insights that emerged from each of the three levels of analysis were assessed iteratively to identify a pattern of interrelationships associated with the policy-making process within the food regulatory system. The identified pattern was interpreted against existing theory to gain a theoretical understanding of the public health policy-making process in this political setting. The central argument of this thesis extends Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith's Advocacy Coalition Framework theory to a food regulation setting. The argument is that within the contemporary political climates of neoliberalism and globalisation, a coalition between corporate interests and the values of scientists with a positivist-reductionist approach to public health research is privileged so as to invoke certain scientific evidence to, in turn, legitimise food regulation policy decisions. The theory will help to inform policy-makers about how and why the public health policy objective in a food regulation setting is interpreted and applied. This will contribute to improving policy practice intended to effect public health outcomes.
It is concluded that irrespective of the quantity and quality of the scientific evidence that is being made available, scientific evidence cannot be assumed to speak for itself Policy-making is an inherently political and value-laden process and the potential for politically motivated interpretation and application of otherwise value-neutral scientific evidence can undermine the investment in its generation. From this perspective, evidence based practice, far from liberating policy-making from political influence, can itself become part of the problem rather than the solution. Nevertheless, rational evidence based practice is an ideal to strive for and a series of recommendations is proposed to help make the use of evidence in current food regulation policy processes more transparent and democratic.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public health administration</field><field name="subject">folic acid in human nutrition</field><field name="subject">enriched foods</field><field name="subject">policy making</field><field name="subject">folate</field><field name="subject">food regulation</field><field name="subject">dietary intake</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.115207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's silence: In the space of words and images.</field><field name="creator">Iggulden, Annette</field><field name="description">My thesis is made up of words and images. This study investigates the way in which silence operates productively within and between the two modes of communication. I suggest that in the process of changing words into images or scripto-visual art-practice, the silence in women's lives can be articulated. I argue that women draw on the generative qualities of silence to create forms of speech that override the cultural constructions of gender which have placed them within the space of &#145;mute&#146; silence.
To gain an historical perspective of this practice by women, I consider the lives of medieval nuns within religious enclosure and their work with words and images in the illuminated manuscript. I make a comparative study of original illuminated manuscripts, focussing mainly on visual language and locating aspects of the work closest to my own art-practice: the visual treatment of the space and inter-textual components of the page or folio. This project does not include an examination of miniatures or historiated initials. Rather, its aim is to identify and compare the use of other aesthetic devices available to the medieval scribe/artist through which they might have interacted with the text. I suggest links between verbal and visual performances of language and the repetition, or copying of texts by medieval nuns, as a means of female embodiment of words and their spaces.
From the outcomes of my studio investigations and my consideration of other contemporary feminist art practices, I demonstrate how women artists may &#145;re-write&#146; the text and &#145;speak&#146; their silence through visual language and the acts of writing, drawing and painting the words of others. Through my engagement with feminist critical theory, the work of medieval scholars, original illuminated manuscripts and my studio research, I propose that scripto-visual practice remains particularly significant for women despite the differences between the medieval period and our own. As a generative practice, it negotiates some of the societal constraints on women's speech and visibility, because its language is &#145;silent and disembodied&#146; from the image of woman constructed by male discourse. It is a form of speech that acknowledges as it defies the social and cultural conditions that shaped its necessity, articulating an alternative voice of women in the space of words and images.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silence</field><field name="subject">women artists</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.120456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Celebrating difference</field><field name="creator">Watkins, Catherine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines short fiction and some poetry by writers from four different Australian cultural communities, the Indigenous community, and the Jewish, Chinese and Middle-Eastern communities. I have chosen to study the most recent short fiction available from a selection of writing which originates from each culture. In the chapters on Chinese-Australian and Middle-Eastern Australian fiction I have examined some poetry if it contributes to the subject matter under discussion. In this study I show how the short story form is used as a platform for these writers to express views on their own cultures and on their identity within Australian society. Through a close examination of texts this study reveals the strategies by which many of these narratives provide an imaginative literary challenge to Anglo-Celtic cultural dominance, a challenge which contributes to the political nature of this writing and the shifting nature of the short story genre. This study shows that by celebrating difference these narratives can act as a site of resistance and show a capacity to reflect and instigate cultural change. This thesis examines the process by which these narratives create a dialogue between cultures and address the problems inherent in diverse cultural communities living together.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">short story</field><field name="subject">foreign authors</field><field name="subject">poetry</field><field name="subject">history and criticism</field><field name="subject">Australian literature</field><field name="subject">literature and society</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.120943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Our fingers were never idle: Women and domestic craft in the Geelong region, 1900-1960.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Ruth Lorna</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of women's domestic crafts in the Geelong region, between 1900 and I960, Through analysing oral testimony and the women's handicraft artefacts, the nature of the domestic production of handicrafts and the meanings the makers have constructed around their creations and their lives is illuminated. The thesis is organised around the themes of work, space, the construction of femininity, memory, time and meaning.
The thesis argues that until recently, the discipline of history has privileged the experiences of men over those of women. It challenges the trivialising of women&#146;s handicrafts. It also argues that within the restrictive social structures around them and within the confined nature of their situations, the women of my study asserted themselves to transform their environments and to improve their situations through labour in the home. In &#145;making do&#146;, recycling materials and creating functional and decorative needlework items for their homes and families, the women were often finding solutions to pressing practical and economic problems. Doing handicrafts was rarely just a passive way of filling in time.
Rather, making and creating was for these women a multi-layered activity that similtaneously fulfilled a complex range of needs for themselves and their families. A multiplicity of deeply personal, aesthetic, familial, social, practical and economic needs were met in the making of domestic craft artefacts, whose symbolism reflected the values and meanings of the women's cultures, homes and families.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crafts</field><field name="subject">geelong</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">women's domestic crafts</field><field name="subject">handicrafts</field><field name="subject">social structures</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.122114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Playing the Agnes: Hester Thrale-Piozzi and Frances Burney.</field><field name="creator">Curlewis, Margaret J</field><field name="description">Guided by the feminist intention of reasserting the importance of neglected female writers, I have used this work to re-examine the lives and texts of eighteenth-century diarists Hester Thrale-Piozzi and Frances Burney. Adopting an interdisciplinary methodology, I draw on both literary and non-literary material to examine the effect of familial and social patriarchy in eighteenth-century England. Using the diaries, journals and letters of Hester and Frances, I ask why female conformity to masculine domination was expected, and how violence was used to extract subserviant behaviour from women.
Beginning with gossip, and encompassing social, editorial and physical abuse, I use the medical profession's manipulation of female vulnerability to exemplify the way society legitimates violence to ensure female ductility. Moving beyond this physical aspect, I then examine the psychical, and question the existence of a &#145;self&#146; which is vulnerable to external manipulation. By diverging from the influence of Freudian psychology, and developing a form of Jungian feminism, I propose the existence of an essential female Self which transcends the constraints of societal expectations and physical violence.
In this work, both Hester and Frances emerge as physically and psychically strong entities who were forced to adopt socially conformist personae to survive.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fanny Burney</field><field name="subject">Hester Lynch Piozzi</field><field name="subject">patriarchy</field><field name="subject">English history</field><field name="subject">18th century england</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.122712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Evaluation of heat stress indices using physiological comparisons in an alumina refinery in a sub-tropical climate.</field><field name="creator">Di Corleto, Ross</field><field name="description">The production of alumina involves the use of a process known as the Bayer process. This method involves the digestion of raw bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures around 250&#176;C. The resultant pregnant liquor then goes through a number of filtering and precipitation processes to obtain the aluminium oxide crystals which are then calcined to obtain the final product. The plant is situated in a sub tropical climate in Northern Australia and this combined with the hot nature of the process results in a potential for heat related illnesses to develop. When assessing a work environment for heat stress a heat stress index is often employed as a guideline and to date the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) has been the recommended index. There have been concerns over the past that the WBGT is not suited to the Northern Australian climate and in fact studies in other countries have suggested this is the case. This study was undertaken in the alumina plant situated in Gladstone Queensland to assess if WBGT was in fact the most suitable index for use or if another was more applicable. To this end three indices, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), Heat Stress Index (HSI) and Required Sweat Rate (SWreq) were compared and assessed using physiological monitoring of heart rate and surrogate core temperature.
A number of different jobs and locations around the plant were investigated utilising personal and environmental monitoring equipment. These results were then collated and analysed using a computer program written as part of the study for the manipulation of the environmental data . Physiological assessment was carried out using methods approved by international bodies such as National Institute for Occupational Safety &amp; Health (NIOSH) and International Standards Organisation (ISO) and incorporated the use of a &#145;Physiological Factor&#146; developed to enable the comparison of predicted allowable exposure times and strain on the individual.
Results indicated that of the three indices tested, Required Sweat Rate was found to be the most suitable for the climate and in the environment of interest. The WBGT system was suitable in areas in the moderate temperature range (ie 28 to 32&#176;C) but had some deficiencies above this temperature or where the relative humidity exceeded approximately 80%. It was however suitable as a first estimate or first line indicator. HSI over-estimated the physiological strain in situations of high temperatures, low air flows and exaggerated the benefit of artificial air flows on the worker in certain environments ie. fans.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heat</field><field name="subject">physiological effect</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">industrial safety</field><field name="subject">aluminum plants</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Gladstone</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.124324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of jersey type on thermoregulatory responses during exercise in a warm humid environment.</field><field name="creator">Meir, Rudi A</field><field name="description">The thermoregulatory responses of subjects wearing two different forms of rugby league jersey, one with plastic sponsorship recognition and numbering (trial Gl) and one without (trial G2), and a lightweight alternative (trial G3), were compared with a trial without any form of upper body garment (trial GO). Ten male volunteers, mean age 20.9 (&#177;2.3) years, height 179.8 (&#177;4.7) cm, weight 80.2 (&#177;8.9) kg, and body surface area 1.99 (&#177;0.13) m2, participated in this study. Subjects had a mean maximal oxygen uptake capacity of 56.0 (&#177;6.3) ml.kg.min-1 and a sum of 8 skinfolds of 80.6 (&#177;23.8) mm. Subjects were exercised at approximately 50% of maximal oxygen uptake in a warm humid environment for 50 minutes. Mean ambient temperature was 27.6&#176;C (&#177;0.32) with a relative humidity of 64.7% (&#177;1.44). Measurements of core and skin (7 sites) temperature, heart rate, oxygen uptake, plasma volume, peak lactate concentration, and pre- and post-trial body weight, hematocrit and garment weight were recorded.
The statistical results showed that all subjects experienced significant (p &#8804;.0001) decreases in body weight representing a percentage decrease ranging from 1.2-1.3%. No significant difference was found between trials with respect to body weight change. No significant effect of garment type was found on pre- and post-trial hematocrit, plasma volume changes or peak blood lactic acid concentration. However, mean peak lactate was highest for trial Gl (5.6 mmol.L-1 &#177;2.2) and lowest for trial G3 (4.6 mmol.L-1 &#177;1.27). Post-trial core temperature was significantly (p&#8804; .0001) higher than the resting value; no significant difference was found between trials. The mean absolute increase for all experimental trials was 0.9&#176;C. A significant (p&#8804;.005) difference between mean total (7 sites) skin temperature was found with a post-hoc test revealing that trials Gl and G2 were significantly higher than trial GO; no significant difference was found when comparing trial G3 with trial GO or when comparing the garments between each other. Mean skin temperature under the garment (4 sites) was found to be significantly (p&#8804;.05) higher for all trials involving a garment when compared with mean skin temperature outside (3 sites) the garment; no significant difference was found between trials. Mean oxygen uptake was significantly different between trials (p&#8804;.005), with trial Gl and G3 found to be significantly lower than trial GO; no difference was found when comparing the garments with each other. Post-trial garment weights were significantly (p&#8804;.001) heavier than pre-trial and were significantly (p&#8804;.0001) different when compared with each other.
There was no significant effect on heart rate, haematocrit, plasma volume changes, peak blood lactic acid concentration, or core temperature due to garment type. However, differences in skin temperature suggest that the garment used in trial G3 may have a benefit. Further research should consider the impact of increased exercise intensity and/or environmental temperature and humidity on the measured parameters while wearing the garments described in this study.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">body temperature</field><field name="subject">regulation</field><field name="subject">thermoregulatory responses</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.132750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poetry and silence: a sequence of disappearances</field><field name="creator">Parsons, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dorothy Featherstone Porter</field><field name="subject">Susan Howe</field><field name="subject">Olive Hopegood</field><field name="subject">Mina Loy</field><field name="subject">silence in literature</field><field name="subject">silence</field><field name="subject">Australian poetry</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.133358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Reactive system model for building fault-tolerant distributed applications.</field><field name="creator">Chen, Changgui</field><field name="description">The development of fault-tolerant computing systems is a very difficult task. Two reasons contributed to this difficulty can be described as follows. The First is that, in normal practice, fault-tolerant computing policies and mechanisms are deeply embedded into most application programs, so that these application programs cannot cope with changes in environments, policies and mechanisms. These factors may change frequently in a distributed environment, especially in a heterogeneous environment. Therefore, in order to develop better fault-tolerant systems that can cope with constant changes in environments and user requirements, it is essential to separate the fault tolerant computing policies and mechanisms in application programs. The second is, on the other hand, a number of techniques have been proposed for the construction of reliable and fault-tolerant computing systems. Many computer systems are being developed to tolerant various hardware and software failures. However, most of these systems are to be used in specific application areas, since it is extremely difficult to develop systems that can be used in general-purpose fault-tolerant computing.
The motivation of this thesis is based on these two aspects. The focus of the thesis is on developing a model based on the reactive system concepts for building better fault-tolerant computing applications. The reactive system concepts are an attractive paradigm for system design, development and maintenance because it separates policies from mechanisms. The stress of the model is to provide flexible system architecture for the general-purpose fault-tolerant application development, and the model can be applied in many specific applications. With this reactive system model, we can separate fault-tolerant computing polices and mechanisms in the applications, so that the development and maintenance of fault-tolerant computing systems can be made easier.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fault-tolerant computing</field><field name="subject">system design</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.134208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Market fit, market orientation, and business performance: An empirical investigation.</field><field name="creator">Taghian, Mehdi</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the congruence of an organisation to its intended target markets. It was hypothesised that the internal activities of an organisation are, potentially, structured in response to its market dynamics with the ultimate aim of achieving the organisational objective(s). Market fit has been conceptualised to represent the fit of an organisation to its operating market environment. The information for this study was collected from senior marketing decision makers, using a self-administered questionnaire. The sample comprised 216 companies from a mix of industries and organisational sizes in Australia.
There is evidence to suggest that the association of market orientation and business performance is inconsistent under different business operating circumstances, due to the exclusion of the influence of key environmental moderators. The model of market fit attempts to overcome this condition. The results suggest that market fit is associated with measures of business performance, and the levels of association are different from those related to the market orientation measures, reflecting the influence of moderators. The categories of environmental moderators contributing at different levels to the market fit measure include: (1) marketing planning, (2) implementation of marketing decisions, (3) market orientation, (4) market strength, (5) generic strategies, (6) organisational culture, (7) familiarity with the marketing audit, and (8) the external environment. The marketing audit procedure has been recommended as a tool to assist with the establishment and maintenance of market fit. The results of this study indicate that organisational familiarity with, and the conduct of, the marketing audit periodically are low, and that market fit may be a better predictor of business performance, than is market orientation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.135152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structured development of an asynchronous forth processor using trace theory.</field><field name="creator">Newlands, D.A.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the use of a structured design methodology in the design of asynchronous circuits so that high level constructs can be specified purely in terms of signal exchanges and without the intrusion of lower level concepts.

Brachiopod faunas of latest Devonian and Carboniferous age have been published or currently in press in the course of the Ph.D candidature and are herein appendixed, while the Early Permian brachiopod faunas are systematically described in this thesis. The described Early Permian brachiopod faunas include 127 species, of which 29 are new and 12 indeterminate, and six new genera (subgenera) are proposed; Tarimella, Bmntonella, Marginifera (Arenaria), Marginifera (Nesiotia), Baliqliqia and Ustritskia.
A new integrated brachiopod biostratigraphical zonation scheme is proposed, for the first time, for the latest Devonian-Early Permian sequences of the entire Tarim Basin on the basis of this study as well as previously published information (including the Candidate's own published papers). The scheme consists of twenty three brachiopod acm biozones, most of which replace previously proposed assemblage or assemblage zones. The age and distribution of these brachiopod zones within the Tarim Basin and their relationships with other important fossil groups are discussed. In terms of regional correlations and biostratigraphical affinities, the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous brachiopod faunas of the Tarim Basin are closest to those from South China, while the Late Carboniferous faunas demonstrate strong similarities to coeval faunas from the Urals, central Asia, North China and South China. During the Asselian-Sakmarian, strong faunal links between the Tarim Basin and those of the Urals persisted, while at the same time links with central Asia, North China and South China weakened. On the other hand, during the Artinskian-Kungurian times, affinities of the Tarim faunas with the Urals/Russian Platform rapidly reduced, when those with peri-Gondwana (South Thailand, northern Tibet) and South China increased.
Thirty lithofacies (or microfacies) types of four facies associations are recognised for the Late Devonian to early Permian sediments. Based on detailed lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy and facies analysis, 23 third-order sequences belonging to four supcrsequences are identified for the Late Devonian to Early Permian successions, from which sea-level fluctuation curves are reconstructed. The sequence stratigraphical analysis
 
reveals that four major regional regressions, each marking a distinct supersequence boundary, can be recognised; they correspond to the end-Serpukhovian, end-Moscovian, late Artinskian and end-Kungurian times, respectively. The development of these sequences is considered to have been formed and regulated by the interplay of both eustasy and tectonism.  Using the system tract of a sequence as the mapping time unit, a succession of 47 palaeogeographical maps have been reconstructed through the Late Devonian to Early Permian.  These maps reveal that the Tarim Basin was first immersed by southwest-directed (Recent geographical orientation) transgression in the late Famennian after the Caledonian Orogeny. Since then, the basin had maintained its geometry as a large, southwest-mouthed embayment until the late Moscovian when most areas were the uplifted above sea-level. The basin was flooded again in late Asselian-Artinskian times when a new transgression came from a large epicontinental sea lying to its northwest. Thereafter, marine deposition was restricted to local areas (southwestern and northwestern margins until the late Kungurian, while deposition of continental deposits prevailed and continued through the Middle and late Permian into the Triassic.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paleontology</field><field name="subject">paleozoic</field><field name="subject">brachiopoda</field><field name="subject">fossil</field><field name="subject">Tarim Basin</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.141146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Definition and quantification of assets.</field><field name="creator">Williams, Sarah J</field><field name="description">The word &#145;asset&#146; was originally taken into the English language, from the Latin &#145;ad satis&#146; and French &#145;asez&#146;, as a term used at law meaning sufficient estate or effects to discharge debts. It later came to be used in the sense of property available for the payment of debts. Assets were understood to be property (objects owned and rights of ownership) that could be exchanged for cash. The importance of factual knowledge of the money equivalents of property and debts, in managing mercantile affairs, was emphasised in accounting manuals during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The rights of investors and creditors to factual up-to-date information about the financial state of affairs of companies, given the advent of limited liability, underscored the early company legislation that required the preparation and auditing of statements of property and debts. During the latter part of the nineteenth century the emphasis in accounting moved away from assets as exchangeable property to assets as deferred costs. Expectations took the place of observables. The abstract (expectational) notion of assets as &#145;future economic benefits&#146; was embraced by accountants in the absence of rigorous definitions of the elements and functions of dated statements of financial position and performance. Assets are quantified financially by a heterogeneous mass of potentially inconsistent rules that, by and large, have no regard for the empirical nature of measurement. Consequently, accountants have failed to provide the community with up-to-date factual information about the financial state of affairs and performance of business entities - and, hence, with an informative basis for financial action.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children with disabilities</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">mainstreaming in education</field><field name="subject">learning disabled children</field><field name="subject">asset accounting</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.142446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adsorption and voltammetry of butyltin compounds.</field><field name="creator">Turoczy, Nicholas John</field><field name="description">The adsorption of tributyltin onto materials commonly used for the construction of sampling and analytical equipment from aqueous solutions of varying ionic composition has been examined. The adsorption appears to be controlled by non-polar interactions between tributyltin and the surface involved. Since the speciation and hence polarity of tributyltin is affected by the ionic composition of the medium, the extent of adsorption is affected by the salinity and pH of a sample. The adsorption is rapid and, unless strategies are adopted to eliminate its effects, may render analytical results invalid.
The electrochemistry of tributyltin, dibutyltin and monobutyltin, individually and in mixtures, has been investigated in aqueous media at mercury electrodes. The basic electrochemistry of each compound is summarised by the reaction
BunSn (4-n)+ + (4-n)e- right left harpoons BunSn
where n is the number of butyl groups attached to the tin atom. However, the electrochemistry of each compound is largely confined to the surface of the mercury electrode, and the simplicity of the above reaction is disrupted by polymerisation reactions and by butyl exchange processes occurring with the mercury electrode. When mixtures of butyltin compounds are present, the various processes that occur for each individual compound interfere with each other. A direct voltaminetric method for the determination of butyltin compounds in natural waters is therefore probably not possible.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tributyltin</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">organotin coumpounds</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.154112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of social background on the development of probabilistic concepts.</field><field name="creator">Peard, Robert</field><field name="description">This research explores how the social backgrounds of a group of students contributed to their intuitive knowledge in probabilistic reasoning, and influenced their processing of the associated mathematics. A group of Year 11 students who came from families for whom the phenomenon of track gambling formed an important part of their cultural background was identified. Another group consisting of students in the same mathematics course (Year 11 Maths in Society) but from families for whom the phenomenon of gambling in any form was totally absent from their social backgrounds was identified. Twenty students were selected from each group.
The research employed a qualitative methodology in which a phenomenographic approach was used to investigate the qualitatively different ways in which individuals within the two groups thought about concepts involving probabilistic reasoning, and processed the related mathematical skills and concepts. The cognitive processes involved in the applications of probabilistic and related mathematical concepts in a variety of both gambling and non-gambling situations were studied in order to determine whether this culturally based knowledge could be viewed as a type of &#145;ethnomathematics.&#146;
Data were obtained through individual structured interviews which enabled patterns of reasoning to be compared and contrasted. Analyses of these data enabled intuitive mathematical understandings possessed by the gamblers not only to be identified, but also to be linked with their social backgrounds. Also differences between how individuals in the two groups processed probabilistic and associated mathematical knowledge were determined. This research complements and extends existing knowledge and theories related to culturally-based mathematical knowledge.

Following the release of the IBM Personal Computer in 1982, microcomputers have become an integral part of most work environments.  The accounting services industry, in particular, has felt the impact of this &#145;microcomputer revolution&#146;.  In Big Six accounting firms, there is almost one microcomputer for each professional accountant employed,  Notwithstanding this, little research has been done on the effect of microcomputers on the work outcomes of professional accountants working in these firms.
This study addresses this issue.  It assesses, in an organisational setting, how accountant&#146; perceptions of ease of use and usefulness of microcomputers act on their computer anxieties, microcomputer attitudes and use to affect their job satisfaction and job performance.  The research also examines how different types of human-computer interfaces affect the relationships between accountants' beliefs about microcomputer utility and ease of use, computer anxiety, microcomputer attitudes and microcomputer use.
To attain this research objective, a conceptual model was first developed, The model indicates that work outcomes (job satisfaction and job performance) of professional accountants using microcomputers are influenced by users' perceptions of ease of use and usefulness of
microcomputers via paths through (a) the level of computer anxiety experienced by users, (b) the general attitude of users toward using microcomputers, and (c) the extent to which microcomputers are used by individuals.  Empirically testable propositions were derived from the model to test the postulated relationships between these constructs.  The study also tested whether or not users of different human-computer interfaces reacted differently to the perceptions and anxieties they hold about microcomputers and their use in the workplace. It was argued that users of graphical interfaces, because of the characteristics of those interfaces, react differently to their perceptions and anxieties about microcomputers compared with users of command-line (or textual-based) interfaces.
A passive-observational study in a field setting was used to test the model and the research propositions. Data was collected from 164 professional accountants working in a Big Six accounting firm in a metropolitan city in Australia.  Structural equation modelling techniques were used to test the, hypothesised causal relationships between the components comprising the general research model. Path analysis and ordinary least squares regression was used to estimate the parameters of the model and analyse the data obtained.  Multisample analysis (or stacked model analysis) using EQS was used to test the fit of the model to the data of the different human-computer interface groups and to estimate the parameters for the paths in those different groups.
The results show that the research model is a good description of the data. The job satisfaction of professional accountants is directly affected by their attitude toward using microcomputers and by microcomputer use itself.  However, job performance appears to be only directly affected by microcomputer attitudes. Microcomputer use does not directly affect job performance. Along with perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, computer anxiety is shown to be an important determinant of attitudes toward using microcomputers - higher levels of computer anxiety negatively affect attitudes toward using microcomputers. Conversely, higher levels of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness heighten individuals' positive attitudes toward using microcomputers. Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness also indirectly affect microcomputer attitudes through their effect on computer anxiety. The results show that higher levels of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness result in lower levels of computer anxiety. A surprising result from the study is that while perceived ease of use is shown to directly affect the level of microcomputer usage, perceived usefulness and attitude toward using microcomputers does not.
The results of the multisample analysis confirm that the research model fits the stacked model and that the stacked model is a significantly better fit if specific parameters are allowed to vary between the two human-computer interface user groups. In general, these results confirm that an interaction exists between the type of human-computer interface (the variable providing the grouping) and the other variables in the model The results show a clear difference between the two groups in the way in which perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness affect microcomputer attitude. In the case of users of command-line interfaces, these variables appear to affect microcomputer attitude via an intervening variable, computer anxiety, whereas in the graphical interface user group the effect occurs directly. Related to this, the results show that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness have a significant direct effect on computer anxiety in command-line interface users, but no effect at all for graphical interface users. Of the two exogenous variables only perceived ease of use, and that in the case of the command-line interface users, has a direct significant effect on extent of use of microcomputers.
In summary, the research has contributed to the development of a theory of individual adjustment to information technology in the workplace. It identifies certain perceptions, anxieties and attitudes about microcomputers and shows how they may affect work outcomes such as job satisfaction and job performance. It also shows that microcomputer-interface types have a differential effect on some of the hypothesised relationships represented in the general model.  Future replication studies could sample a broader cross-section of the microcomputer user community.
Finally, the results should help Big Six accounting firms to maximise the benefits of microcomputer use by making them aware of how working with microcomputers affects job satisfaction and job performance.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human computer interaction</field><field name="subject">accounting</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">accounting practice</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.155628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective agents based on adenosine.</field><field name="creator">Wright, Denis Matthew John</field><field name="description">N-Ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (12) was synthesised from adenosine (1) and the 6-chloro-2&#146;,3&#146;-O-isopropylidene-AT-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (25) was synthesised from inosine (19).
Employing molecular modelling techniques and the results from previous structure activity relationships it was possible to design and synthesise a N6-substituted N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosines which possessed an oxygen in the N6-substituent either in the form of an epoxide (which was obtained by cpoxidising an alkene with m-CPBA or dimethyldioxirane) or in the form of a cyclic ether as was the case for N6-((tetrahydro-2H--pyran--2-yl)methyl-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (78). These compounds were tested for their biological activity at the A1 adenosine receptor by their ability to inhibit cAMP accumulation in DDT, MF2 cells. The EC50 values obtained indicated that the N6-(norborn-5-en-2-yl)-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosines were the most potent. Of theseN6-(S-endo-norbrn-5-en-2-yI)-N-ethylcarboxaniidoadenosine (56) was the most potent (0.2 nM). N6-(exo-norborn-5-en-2-yl)-2-iodo-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (79) was synthesised from guanosine (22) and was also evaluated for its potency at the A, receptor (24.8 &#177; 1.5 nM). At present 79 is being evaluated for its selectivity for the A1 receptor compared to the other three receptor subtypes (A2a, A2b, A3). A series of N6-(benzyl)-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosines were synthesised with substitutions at the 4-position of the phenyl ring. Another series of compounds were
synthesised which replaced the methylene spacer between the N6H and the N6-aromatic
or lipophilic substituent The replacement groups -were carbonyl and trans-2-
cyclopropyl moieties. The N6-acyl compounds were obtained by reacting 2&#146;,3&#146;-O-
di(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-AT-ethylcarboxamidoadenosinc (59) with the appropriate acid chloride and then deprotecting with lelrabutylammonium fluoride in
tetrahydrofuran. The compound N6-(4-(1,2-dihydroxy)ethyl)benzyl-N-
ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (125) was synthesised by the reaction of 4-(1,2-0-
isopropylidene-ethyl)benzyl aminc (123) with 6-chloro-2,3-0-isopropylidene-N-
ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (25). Compound 123 was synthesised from an
epoxidation of vinylbenzyl phthalimide (118) followed by an acidic ring opening to
yield the diol which was isopropylidenated to yield 4-(l,2-O-isopropylidene-
elhyl)benzyl phlhalimide (122), It was hoped that the presence of the diol

The global economic boom of the 1980s was one in which the role of Japan was particularly important. In less than half a decade capital flows from Japan surged to make it the world's largest investor. Locations in the Pacific Basin were favoured destinations for Japanese investment, one of the most significant was the Gold Coast. Japanese capital and tourism helped transform its urban area from a national resort to an international tourist destination and resort centre, The surge of capital arriving to the Gold Coast was a function of economic conditions in Japan, as was its steep reduction after November 1989, Thus the Gold Coast became integrated into global capital flows and so dependent on decisions made in Tokyo, one of the main financial centres of the world. However this study has also sought to explore a more complex reality; namely, that this place also became the interface of complex cultural forces and perceptions. The wealth of the Japanese investors on the Gold Coast enabled them to realize their dream of developing projects in the most fashionable global styles. These styles were essentially Western, and it was onto these that their Japanese owners ascribed their own meanings; meanings that reflected the cultural baggage that they had brought from Japan, and through which were filtered the economic and environmental realities of the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast as locality also included residents. Hence it became an interface between two different groups of people, the Japanese and the strongly Anglo-Celtic local community. Some in the local community perceived the Japanese presence as a threat to their perception of the Gold Coast, in fact, a threat to their perception of Australia's national identity. A campaign based on the politics of memory of the Japanese developed on the Gold Coast. Within weeks it became a national debate in which isolationalist, if not xenophobic traditionalists, concentrated on the Gold Coast challenged the economic rationalism and multicultural tolerance of the self-interested and ideologically convinced advocates of globalization. Governments at all levels sought to arbitrate, to legitimize standpoints, but more often than not were seen to move into positions of ineffectual flexibility. The forces of globalization on the Gold Coast were catalysts for change that in turn provoked local opposition which rapidly became a debate about national identity and direction. It is in the exploration of the complex and contradictory economic, cultural and political forces engendered by globalization that this study has sought to make a distinctive contribution.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">investments</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast</field><field name="subject">national characteristics</field><field name="subject">economics</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.161432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Portrait of Albert Tucker, 1914-1960</field><field name="creator">Burke, Janine</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Albert Tucker</field><field name="subject">australian artists</field><field name="subject">painiting</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050915.161937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using everyday experiences in teaching secondary mathematics in Malawi: Possibilities and constraints for change.</field><field name="creator">Mwakapenda, Willy Weston J</field><field name="description">Proponents of socially and culturally oriented mathematics education have argued that teaching approaches which value and connect with the learner's prior knowledge and everyday experience are more likely to promote active, meaningful, relevant and liberatory learning than approaches which rely on transmission and abstract presentation of mathematical content.
In Malawi, proposals to reform the outdated secondary mathematics curriculum have been made with the aim of aligning mathematics instruction with the social and political changes in the current Malawian society. Using a case study approach, this study investigated the extent to which everyday experiences could be used as a vehicle for changing the learning and teaching of secondary mathematics in Malawi. The study was collaborative, taking place over a period of five months in severely overcrowded and poorly resourced classes in two schools. It involved three mathematics teachers in a cycle of planning and teaching mathematics lessons based on the use of everyday experiences, and observation of and reflection on these lessons, in order to document the effects of using everyday experiences on student learning and teachers' teaching practices. The data was collected through student questionnaires; classroom observations and fieldnotes; interviews and reflective meetings with teachers; and informal meetings with key education officials in Malawi. Mathematics examination results from students involved in this study and a corresponding group from the previous year were collected. A reflective and critical approach was adopted in the interpretation and discussion of the data.
Teachers' participation in this study resulted in heightened awareness of their teaching roles and the value of linking school mathematics with everyday experience. The study also shows that students found mathematics interesting and important to learn despite their lack of success in it. In addition, the study documented a number of constraints to change in mathematics instruction such as teachers' focus on mathematics content and examination requirements, and students' resistance to inquiry learning. It also recorded possibilities and barriers to collaboration both between teachers and researchers, and teachers themselves.
The findings of this study are timely since they could serve to inform the reform of the Malawian secondary mathematics curriculum currently being undertaken, which began without a critical examination of the classroom conditions necessary to accommodate a socio-politically relevant mathematics education.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Malawi</field><field name="subject">secondary mathematics curriculum</field><field name="subject">Malawian society</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.111732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ways of the philosopher: What Plato dodn't say.</field><field name="creator">Rzechorzek, Peter</field><field name="description">Socrates' search is for direction in life, for how one should live. For him, an unexamined life is not worth living. The suggestion in this thesis is that Plato follows Socrates in asking the extremely relevant and practical question that seeks to discover the sort of life worthy of the human individual. For Plato, the answer involves the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, it is, in short, to do philosophy. Socrates regards genuine philosophy as active and dialectical. Plato accepts the challenge of conveying this through the written word. Implicit in his dialogues is the idea that human wisdom is a fusion of the spiritual and the rational. The philosophic life is realised in practice by following the three interdependent ways of the philosopher, these are the ways of dialectics, death and love. These identify the philosophic life with a critically detached, yet passionate attitude to the world. However, this practical teaching is guided and informed by Plato's metaphysics, in particular his idea of the Good. A major task of this thesis is to show how the idea of the Good is relevant to ordinary human conduct.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plato</field><field name="subject">metaphysics</field><field name="subject">Socrates</field><field name="subject">life worthiness</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.112729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Chemistry, spectroscopy and analytical applications of certain chemiluminescent reactions.</field><field name="creator">Hindson, Benjamin Joseph</field><field name="description">Chemiluminescence, the production of light from a chemical reaction, has found widespread use in analytical chemistry. Both tris (2, 2&#146;-bipyridyl) ruthenium (II) and acidic potassium permanganate are chemiluminescence reagents that have been employed for the determination of a diverse range of analytes. This thesis encompasses some fundamental investigations into the chemistry and spectroscopy of these chemiluminescence reactions as well as extending the scope of their analytical applications.
Specifically, a simple and robust capillary electrophoresis chemiluminescence detection system for the determination of codeine, O6-methylcodeine and thebaine is described, based upon the reaction of these analytes with chemically generated tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(III) prepared in sulfuric acid (0.05 M). The reagent solution was contained in a glass detection cell, which also held both the capillary and the cathode. The resultant chemiluminescence was monitored directly using a photomultiplier tube mounted flush against the base of the detection cell. The methodology, which incorporated a field amplification sample introduction procedure, realised detection limits (3a baseline noise) of 5 x 10~8 M for both codeine and O6-methylcodeine and 1 x 10~7 M for thebaine. The relative standard deviations of the migration times and the peak areas for the three analytes ranged from 2.2 % up to 2.5 % and 1.9 % up to 4.6 % respectively.
Following minor instrumental modifications, morphine, oripavine and pseudomorphine were determined based upon their reaction with acidic potassium permanganate in the presence of sodium polyphosphate. To ensure no migration of the permanganate anion occurred, the anode was placed at the detector end whilst the electroosmotic flow was reversed by the addition of hexadimethrine bromide (0.001% m/v) to the electrolyte. The three analytes were separated counter to the electroosmotic flow via their interaction with a-cyclodextrin. The methodology realised detection limits (3 x S/N) of 2.5 x 10~7 M for both morphine and oripavine and 5 x 10~7 M for pseudomorphine. The relative standard deviations of the migration times and the peak heights for the three analytes ranged from 0.6 % up to 0.8 % and 1.5% up to 2.1 % respectively. Further improvements were made by incorporating a co-axial sheath flow detection cell. The methodology was validated by comparing the results realised using this technique with those obtained by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), for the determination of both morphine and oripavine in seven industrial process liquors. A complimentary capillary electrophoresis procedure with UV-absorption detection was also developed and applied to the determination of morphine, codeine, oripavine and thebaine in nine process liquors. The results were compared with those achieved using a standard HPLC method.
Although over eighty papers have appeared in the literature on the analytical applications of acidic potassium permanganate chemiluminescence, little effort has been directed towards identifying the origin of the luminescence. It was found that chemiluminescence was generated during the manganese(III), manganese(IV) and manganese(VII) oxidations of sodium borohydride, sodium dithionite, sodium sulfite and hydrazine sulfate in acidic aqueous solution. From the corrected chemiluminescence spectra, the wavelengths of maximum emission were 689 &#177; 5 nm and 734 &#177; 5 nm when the reactions were performed in sodium hexametaphosphate and sodium dihydrogenorthophosphate or orthophosphoric acid environments respectively. The corrected phosphorescence spectrum of manganese(II) sulfate in a solution of sodium hexametaphosphate at 77 K, exhibited two peaks with maxima at 688 nm and 730 nm. The chemical and spectroscopic evidence presented strongly supported the postulation that the emission was an example of solution phase chemically induced phosphorescence of manganese(II). Thereby confirming earlier predictions that the chemiluminescence from acidic potassium permanganate reactions originated from an excited manganese(II) species.
Additionally, these findings have had direct analytical application in that manganese(IV) was evaluated as a new reagent for chemiluminescence detection. The oxidations of twenty five organic and inorganic species, with solublised manganese(IV), were found to elicit analytically useful chemiluminescence with detection limits (3 x S/N) for Mn(II), Fe(II), morphine and codeine of 5 x 10-8 M, 2.5 x 10-7 M, 7.5 x 10-8 M and 5 x 10-8M, respectively. The corrected emission spectra from four different analytes gave wavelengths of maximum emission in the range from 733 nm up to 740 nm indicating that these chemiluminescence reactions also shared a common emitting species, excited manganese(II). Whilst several analytical problems were addressed in this thesis and answers to certain questions regarding the fundamentals of acidic potassium permanganate chemiluminescence were proposed, there are several areas that would benefit from further research.  These are outlined in the final chapter of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemiluminescent</field><field name="subject">chemistry</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">analytical applciations</field><field name="subject">luminescence spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.114704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward a broader appreciation of human motion in education.</field><field name="creator">Dodd, Graham Douglas</field><field name="description">Motion is a fundamental activity for the healthy functioning human organism. Its importance, however, is increasingly de-valued in Western cultures as they speed toward adopting technologies and virtual experiences as adjuncts to, and even replacements for7 traditional educational structures and processes that involve physical activity. Organised and reflective experience of human motion is becoming increasingly marginalised in teaching methodologies and learning programs in educational institutions at all levels around the globe.
This inquiry sets out to gain a greater understanding of why people and human motion become disconnected, particularly during periods of formal education. A central question and two sub-questions form the basis of the inquiry. The central question asks why human motion is not valued and more utilised in education. In particular, why do learning areas that directly represent involvement with human motion, such as physical education, continually struggle in education programs. It directs the investigation to focus on the causes rather than the symptoms of the disuse and devaluation of human motion in Australian education. The two sub-questions split the praxis of the study. The first seeks to understand how the causes of devaluation work in the educational context lo affect the lack of acknowledgement; and the second considers ways to counter the disuse of human movement in education programs.
To address these questions, the research focuses on rebutting the notion of a mind-body dualism. Rather, it seeks to better understand how humans learn and function as monists - integrated beings, acquiring self-knowledge in their 'world of being' in which bodily and emotional experiences, and reasoning are inextricably intertwined.
I have approached this qualitative research as an ethnographic sociologist examining the issues from a critical high modernist perspective in order to demonstrate the pervading influence in Australian education of strong beliefs and values from the era of Enlightenment. Narrative analysis of 'memoir' in the form of self-defining memories was selected to gain a sensibility of the connectedness between human emotion, motion and reasoning in the lived experiences of students in three primary and three secondary schools across Years 2-12. An opportunity for human movement to be more valued and utilised in emerging educational frameworks that have life knowledge, dispositions and capabilities at their core is identified.
The inquiry proposes a conceptualisation of human motion in education for new times characterised by the need for people to develop personal resources and strong positive identities in order to cope with a world of rapid change and uncertainty.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mind and body</field><field name="subject">perceptual-motor learning</field><field name="subject">psychology of learning</field><field name="subject">movement education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.115722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning the role: Through the eyes of beginning principals.</field><field name="creator">O'Mahony, Gary Raymond McColl</field><field name="description">This study examines how first year principals learn their roles and provides the picture through their eyes. As there is no formal preparation requirement to become a principal in Victorian government schools, new principals must seek out and direct their own learning for the role. The study describes the informal and formal sources of learning that are sought by beginning principals to help them learn about their new role. The focus is on identifying what sources of learning were used through different phases of the study and how some became more critical than others in shaping and developing the role of a principal in the school.
This thesis is a story of continuous professional socialization and learning of a group of seven beginning principals using case studies and interviews over four phases of learning in their first year in the role as they proceed from appointment, entry, establishment through to consolidation of the role.
The process of socialization underpins the study and is conceived as a process of learning in which the participants actively direct and participate in their own socialization. However, greater emphasis is placed on the developing nature and reliance on learning in role development. Previous studies of professional socialization of beginning principals have identified licensure programs as significant in the preparation and ongoing development process, whereas this is not the case in Victoria where no such requirements exist. This study adds to existing studies through the finding that there are similarities in the stages of professional socialization process in the Australian context, but also explores new aspects about professional learning by identifying various phases and sources of learning for Victorian principals. These ranged from dependence upon an apprenticeship arrangement, through self-directed task learning, to that of becoming an independent learner within a professional community of equals. Some of the themes identified and explored in this study included examining phases of learning, sources of learning, and their effect on role development.
 
The study was initially based on identifying and exploring some of the key issues and the significance of learning experiences suggested by the beginning principals rather than researching predetermined hypotheses. This grounded and qualitative approach involved data collection over four different time phases in the first year in the role and allowed flexibility in the construction of case studies and the cumulative development of data through the study. The greater part of the data were collected through interviews in each of the four phases of the study along with the collection of survey data for comparison and contrast in the first and final study phases.
The research raises many issues that can serve as a basis for further exploration of the complexity of the role of learning within professional socialization for beginning principals. As well, it suggests a number of implications for the organization of professional learning and socialization in beginning principal socialization for the first year in the role.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary schools</field><field name="subject">school principals</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">education and state</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.120428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the photochemical stability of organophosphorus insecticides for textile mothproofing.</field><field name="creator">Madden, Bernard W</field><field name="description">The light stability of 0,0-diethyl-0-(4-ethylthiophenyl)phosphorothioate, a parent structure of a new class of fibre-reactive organophosphorus insectproofing agents for use on wool textiles was extensively examined.

The major photodegradation products in each case were correlated with the HPLC retention times of synthetically prepared compounds. The main product formed was the sulphoxide, 0,0-diethyl-O-(4-ethylsulphinylphenyl)phosphorothioate, whose insecticidal activity against the major textile pests was shown to be similar to that of the parent compound.

This thesis investigates how the filling regime and solidification of the mould influences defects in the castings produced from that mould. Design guidelines to reduce such defects are proposed and tested.
An existing shrinkage fault in a Grey Iron disc brake casting is simulated using a commercial finite-difference computer program. Three criteria are used to predict the defect and the effect of changes to the feeder geometry. Critical Fraction Solidification analysis is used to determine whether the feeder remains in liquid contact with the casting during solidification and this approach is shown to correctly predict the presence or absence of porosity* The feeder block is extended below the ingate of the casting to improve liquid contact between the casting and feeder without significantly increasing the feeder mass. Plant trials confirm the change to the feeder eliminates the porosity defect.
The runner system and mould venting for a thin walled Ductile Iron casting are investigated. Trials show that by setting the total mould vent area to be greater than the net ingate area of the castings, the cold-shut frequency is halved. A method for runner system design based on peak linear flow velocity in the runner during mould filling is proposed. A new pressurised runner system produces castings with significantly fewer defects and reduced pour weight when runner areas are designed to maintain peak velocity below 1 m/s. Peak velocity and magnesium levels are demonstrated to be critical factors in the elimination of cold-shut defects. A pressurised runner system is also shown to isolate inclusion defects from castings more effectively than an unpressurised system.
From this work, a technique is proposed which allows the yield of an existing runner and feeder system for iron castings to be improved with confidence in the results.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">iron founding</field><field name="subject">metal castings</field><field name="subject">metal defects</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.122220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an integration of theories of achievement motivation.</field><field name="creator">Wellman, David Allen</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated children's school achievement in terms of an integration of three theories of achievement motivation. The three theoretical outlooks were expectancy-value theory (EVT), implicit theories of intelligence (ITI), and flow theory (FT). The first of two studies was an exploratory investigation of the effectiveness of each theory independently and combined to predict children's achievement in four school subjects. The subject areas were maths, reading, instrumental music and sport. Participants were 84 children (40 females and 44 males) aged 9 to 10 years, one of each child's parents, and school teachers of each child in the four subject areas. All data were collected through questionnaires based on the three models. The results indicated that EVT and FT but not ITI accounted for a significant amount of the variance in children's achievement, including effects for subject area and gender. A second confirmatory study tested EVT, FT and an integrated model for the prediction of achievement in maths, reading and instrumental music. The participants were a further 141 children (74 females and 67 males) aged 10 to 11 years, and a parent and teachers of each child. Data collection using questionnaires occurred early in the school year (Timel) and approximately five months later (Time2). For EVT, children and parents&#146; competence beliefs were significant predictors of children's achievement in each subject area. Females tended to believe themselves more competent at reading and instrumental music and also valued these subjects more highly than boys. Modeling results for flow theory indicated that children's emotional responses to classes (happiness and confusion) were significant predictors of achievement, the type of emotion varying between subject areas and time periods. Females generally had a more positive emotional reaction to reading and instrumental music classes than males did. The integrated model results indicated significant relationships between EVT and flow theories for each subject area, with EVT explaining most achievement variance in the integrated model. Children's and parents&#146; competence beliefs were the main predictors of achievement at Timel and 2, Subject area and gender differences were found which provide direction for future research. Anecdotal reports of parents and teachers often attest to individual differences in children's involvement in various school domains. Even among children of apparently similar intelligence, it is not uncommon to find one who likes nothing better than to work on a mathematics problem while another much prefers to read a novel or play a musical instrument Some children appear to achieve good results for most of the activities in which they are engaged while others achieve in a less consistent manner, sometimes particularly excelling in one activity. Some children respond to failure experiences with a determination to improve their performance in the future while others react with resignation and acceptance of their low ability. Some children appear to become totally absorbed in the activity of playing sport while others cannot wait for the game to end. The primary research objective guiding the current thesis is how children's thoughts and feelings about school subjects differ and are related to their school achievement. A perusal of the achievement motivation literature indicates several possible models and concepts that can be applied to explain individual differences in children's school achievement. Concepts such as academic self-concept, multiple intelligences, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, self-beliefs, competence beliefs, subjective task values, mastery and performance goals, &#145;Flow&#146; experiences and social motivation are just some of the constructs used to explain children's achievement motivation, both within and between various activity domains. These constructs are proposed by researchers from different theoretical perspectives to achievement motivation. Although there is much literature relevant to each perspective, there is little research indicating how the various perspectives may relate to each other. The current thesis will begin by reviewing three currently popular theoretical orientations cited in achievement motivation research: subjective beliefs and values; implicit theories of intelligence, and flow experience and family complexity. Following this review, a framework will be proposed for testing the determinants of children's school achievement, both within each of the three theoretical perspectives and also in combination.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">achievement motication in children</field><field name="subject">academic achievement</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">expectancy-value theory</field><field name="subject">EVT</field><field name="subject">implicit theories of intellignece</field><field name="subject">ITI</field><field name="subject">flow theory</field><field name="subject">FT</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.123821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Story of fable: A narrative analysis of the experience of four registered nurses in their first year of practice.</field><field name="creator">Penney, Wendy</field><field name="description">This research explores the transition from student to registered nurse from the perspective of the new graduate. This interpretive study uses narrative analysis as the methodology. Individual stories were collected and processed using the method of core story creation and emplotment (Emden 1998). Four newly registered nurses were invited to share stories related to how they were experiencing their role. Participants were encouraged to tell their stories in response to the open question 'what is it like to be a registered nurse?' In the final step of the analysis one honest and critical story has been crafted (Barone 1992) using a process termed emplotment thus disclosing the themes that allow the stories to be grasped together as a single story (Polkinghorne 1988, Emden 1998). The final story of 'Fable' gives insight into the ways in which newly registered nurses experience their role. Becoming a registered nurse is not easy however, Fable finds that nursing is more than just a job and describes many rewarding experiences. It is hoped that the outcomes of this research will be valuable to students, graduates, nurse academics and the profession of nursing generally by enhancing understandings of the relationship between the graduate and the actual employment experience.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">nursing attitudes</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">nursing students</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.133204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Implementation of student active learning in primary mathematics in Indonesia.</field><field name="creator">Pardjono, [none]</field><field name="description">Twenty years after the first pilot projects began to develop Student Active Learning (SAL) in Indonesia, and four years since it was adopted for use in the last provinces, this research investigates the implementation of Student Active Learning in Indonesian primary mathematics classrooms.
A study of the relevant literature indicates that teaching based on constructivist principles is unlikely to be implemented well in mathematics classrooms unless there are high quality teachers, readily available manipulative materials, and a supportive learning environment. As Indonesian schools often lack one or more of these aspects, it seemed likely that Student Active Learning principles might not be &#145;fully&#146; implemented in Indonesian primary mathematics classrooms. Thus a smaller scale, parallel study was carried out in Australian schools where there is no policy of Student Active Learning, but where its underlying principles are compatible with the stated views about learning and teaching mathematics.
The study employed a qualitative interpretive methodology. Sixteen primary teachers from four urban and four rural Indonesian schools and four teachers from two Victorian schools were observed for four mathematics lessons each. The twenty teachers, as well as fourteen Indonesian headteachers and other education professionals, were interviewed in order to establish links between the background and beliefs of participants, and their implementation of Student Active Learning. Information on perceived constraints on the implementation of SAL was also sought.
The results of this study suggest that Student Active learning has been implemented at four levels in Indonesian primary mathematics classrooms, ranging from essentially no implementation to a relatively high level of implementation, with an even higher level of implementation in three of the four Australian classrooms observed. Indonesian teachers, headteachers and supervisors hold a range of views of SAL and also of mathematics learning and teaching. These views largely depended on their in-service training in SAL and, more particularly, on their participation in the PEQIP project Typically, participants&#146; expressed views of SAL were at the same or higher level as their views of mathematics learning and teaching, with a similar pattern being observed in the relationship between these latter views and their implementation of SAL principles. Three factors were identified as influencing teacher change in terms of implementation of SAL: policy, curricular and organisational, and attitudes.
Recommendations arising from this study include the adoption of reflection as an underlying principle in the theory of SAL, the continuation and extension of PEQIP type projects, changes in government policy on curriculum coverage and pre-service teacher training, and more support for teachers at the school and local authority levels.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">primary teaching</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">learning of psychology</field><field name="subject">student active learning</field><field name="subject">primary mathematics in indonesia</field><field name="subject">maths</field><field name="subject">SAL</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.134922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Integrity of the circadian time-keeping system in chronic fatigue syndrome.</field><field name="creator">Tooley, Gregory Allan</field><field name="description">Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition in which severe, ongoing fatigue is the most prominent of a complex of somatic, psychological and neuropsychological symptoms. The aetiology of CFS remains uncertain and, to date, efforts to distinguish a clear pathophysiological profile for the disorder have been unsuccessful.   Current evidence suggests that, rather than being a discrete disease entity with a single cause, CFS is a clinical condition resulting from the interaction of a number of pathophysiological factors, including acute infections, stress and psychiatric disorder. Recently, there has been some interest in the proposition that disordered circadian time-keeping may contribute to the development and/or course of the illness. The rationale for the investigation of circadian factors in CFS is based on the fact that disorders known to be associated with circadian dysregulation, such as jet lag and shiftwork related syndromes have a high degree of symptomatological overlap with CFS. Also, the presence of circadian disturbance could account, in part, for other phenomenological aspects of CFS, including the high rates of comorbid affective disturbance, and the reports of low-level immune dyregulation among sufferers. While several recent studies have produced some evidence of chronobiological dysregulation in CFS patients, much work remains before conclusions can be drawn about the presence, nature and clinical significance of circadian disturbance in CFS.   This thesis describes a series of studies that were designed to systematically investigate: 1. whether CFS is associated with a state of circadian dysregulation, and 2. whether circadian dysregulation contributes significantly to the symptomatology of CFS. The first of the 5 studies reported here compared the circadian patterns of sleep-activity of CFS sufferers with those of healthy controls. Results indicated that CFS patients' sleep-activity cycles were significantly phase delayed compared to controls, and that some aspects of their circadian profiles of sleep-activity were related to some measures of sleep-disturbance and well-being. Studies 2 and 3 investigated the relationship between rhythms of sleep-wake and core temperature in CFS patients and healthy controls. The major finding from these studies was that sleep-wake and core temperature rhythms appear to be less effectively synchronised. Further evidence was collected that suggested that there was a relationship between circadian parameters and symptom measures in the CFS group.
 
While this indicated that circadian dysregulation is linked in some way to the symptoms of CFS, assessment of the actual clinical significance of circadian disturbances required the use of a prospective methodology. The final two studies, therefore, report on a placebo-controlled trial of clinical interventions that were designed to restore circadian integrity to CFS patients, in order to see whether this would lead to a reduction in symptom number or severity. Results indicated that, although patients experienced improvements across a range of measures of symptoms and functional capacity, these were small in magnitude, of unlikely clinical significance, and no greater, in general, to improvements reported by patients who underwent placebo treatment. These results, along with those of the earlier studies, are discussed with respect to their implications regarding the presence and significance of circadian dysregulation. It is concluded that, while they provide evidence that CFS is associated with a degree of both internal and external circadian desynchrony, these findings suggest that circadian dysregulation is likely to be only a peripheral, contributor to the processes that generate and maintain the symptom complex. These findings are discussed with respect to how they contribute to our overall understanding of this multi-dimensional condition, and the implications they have for the continuing effort to investigate the causes and treatment of CFS.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chronic fatigue syndrome</field><field name="subject">CFS</field><field name="subject">circadian rhythms</field><field name="subject">cause and treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.135752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the 'all hazards' approach to disaster management as applied to field disaster management and pre-hospital care in Australia.</field><field name="creator">Cato, Denys</field><field name="description">Disasters, emergencies, incidents, and major incidents - they all come back to the same thing regardless of what they are called. The common denominator is that there is loss of life, injury to people and animals and damage and destruction of property.
The management of such events relies on four phases:
1.	Prevention
2.	Preparation
3.	Response
4.	Recovery
Each of these phases is managed in a different way and often by different teams. Here, concentration has been given to phases 2 and 3, with particular emphasis on phase 3, Response.
The words used to describe such events are often related to legislation. The terminology is detailed later. However, whatever the description, whenever prevention is not possible, or fails, then the need is to respond. Response is always better when the responders are prepared. Training is a major part of response preparation and this book is designed to assist those in the health industry who need to be ready when something happens. One of the training packages for responders is the Major Incident Medical Management and Support (MIMMS) Course and this work was designed to supplement the manual prepared by Hodgetts and Macway-Jones(87) in the UK.
Included is what the health services responder, who may be sent to an event in which the main concern is trauma, should know. Concentration is on the initial response and does not deal in any detail with hospital reaction, the public health aspects, or the mental health support that provides psychological help to victims and responders, and which are also essential parts of disaster management.
People, in times of disaster, have always been quick to offer assistance. It is now well recognised however, that the 'enthusiastic amateur', whilst being a well meaning volunteer, isn't always what is needed. All too often such people have made things worse and have sometimes ended up as victims themselves. There is a place now for volunteers and there probably always will be. The big difference is that these people must be well informed, well trained and well practiced if they are to be effective.
Fortunately such people and organisations do exist. Without the work of the St John Ambulance, the State Emergency Service, the Rural Fire Service the Red Cross and the Volunteer Rescue Association, to mention only a few, our response to disasters would be far less effective.
There is a strong history of individuals being available to help the community in times of crisis. Mostly these people were volunteers but there has also always been the need for a core of professional support. In the recent past,
 
professional support mechanisms have been developed from lessons learned, particularly to situations that need a rapid and well organised response.
As lessons are learned from an analysis of events, philosophy and methods have changed. Our present system is not perfect and perhaps never will be. The need for an 'all-hazards approach' makes detailed planning very difficult and so there will probably always be criticisms about the way an event was handled. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, provided we learn from it. That means that this text is certainly not the 'last word' and revisions as we learn from experience will be inevitable.
Because the author works primarily in New South Wales, many of the explanations and examples are specific to that state. In Australia disaster response is a State, rather than a Commonwealth, responsibility and consequently, and inevitably, there are differences in management between the states and territories within Australia. With the influence of Emergency Management Australia, these differences are being reduced. This means that across state and territory boundaries, assistance is common and interstate teams can be deployed and assimilated into the response rapidly, safely, effectively and with minimum explanation. This text sets out to increase the understanding of what is required, what is in place and how the processes of response are managed.
By way of introduction and background, examples are given of those situations that have occurred, or could happen.
Man Made Disasters has been divided into two distinct sections. Those which are related to structures or transport and those related directly to people. The first section, Chapter 3, includes:
&#149;   Transport accidents involving land, rail, sea or air vehicles.
&#149;   Collapse of buildings for reasons other than earthquakes or storms.
&#149;   Industrial accidents, including the release of hazardous substances and nuclear events.
A second section dealing with the consequences of the direct actions of people is separated as Chapter 4, entitled 'People Disasters'. Included are:
&#149;   Crowd incidents involving sports and entertainment venues.
&#149;   Terrorism
From Chapter 4 on, the emphasis is on the Response phase and deals with organisation and response techniques in detail.
Finally there is a section on terminology and abbreviations. An appendix details a typical disaster pack content.

Sequence comparisons of the bluetongue virus (BTV) RNA3 from different regions of the world (North America, South Africa, India, Indonesian, Malaysia, Australia and the Caribbean region) showed that geographic separation had resulted in significant divergence, consistent with the evolution of distinct viral populations. There were at least 3 topotypes (Gould, 1987); the Australasian, African - American and another topotype represented by BTV 15 isolated in Australia in 1986. The topotypes of BTV had RNA3 nucleotide sequences that differed by approximately 20 per cent. Analysis of BTV-specific gene segments from animal and insect specimens showed that bluetongue viruses had entered northern Australia from South East Asia, possibly by wind-borne vectors. Nucleotide sequence comparisons were used to show the close genetic relationship between BTV 2 (Ona-A strain) from Florida and BTV 12 from Jamaica, and to investigate the reassortment of BTV genome segments in nature.

A retrospective assessment of exposure to benzene was carried out for a case control study of leukaemia in the Australian petroleum industry. The study used the mean of personal task-based measurements (Base Estimates) in a deterministic algorithm and applied factors to model back to places, times etc for which no exposure measurements were available. Mean daily exposures were estimated, on an individual subject basis, by summing the task-based exposures. These mean exposures were multiplied by the years spent on each job to provide exposure estimates in ppm-years. These were summed to provide a Cumulative Estimate for each subject.
Validation was completed for the model and key inputs.
Exposures were low, most jobs were below TWA of 5 ppm benzene. Exposures in terminals were generally higher than at refineries. Cumulative Estimates ranged from 0.005 to 50.9 ppm-years, with 84 percent less than 10 ppm-years.
Exposure probability distributions were developed for tanker drivers using Monte Carlo simulation of the exposure estimation algorithm. The outcome was a lognormal distribution of exposure for each driver. These provide the basis for alternative risk assessment metrics e.g. the frequency of short but intense exposures which provided only a minimal contribution to the long-term average exposure but may increase risk of leukaemia.
The effect of different inputs to the model were examined and their significance assessed using Monte Carlo simulation. The Base Estimates were the most important determinant of exposure in the model. The sources of variability in the measured data were examined, including the effect of having censored data and the between and within-worker variability. The sources of uncertainty in the exposure estimates were analysed and consequential improvements in exposure assessment identified.
Monte Carlo sampling was also used to examine the uncertainties and variability associated with the tanker drivers' exposure assessment, to derive an estimate of the range and to put confidence intervals on the daily mean exposures. The identified uncertainty was less than the variability associated with the estimates.
The traditional approach to exposure estimation typically derives only point estimates of mean exposure. The approach developed here allows a range of exposure estimates to be made and provides a more flexible and improved basis for risk assessment.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">benzene</field><field name="subject">health aspects</field><field name="subject">measurements</field><field name="subject">petroluem industry and trade</field><field name="subject">health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">industrial toxicology</field><field name="subject">leukaemia in the Australian petroleum industry</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.142634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tensile behaviour of non-uniform fibres and fibrous composites.</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Yuping</field><field name="description">This work investigates the tensile behaviour of non-uniform fibres and fibrous composites. Wool fibres are used as an example of non-uniform fibres because they're physical, morphological and geometrical properties vary greatly not only between fibres but also within a fibre. The focus of this work is on the effect of both between-fibre and within-fibre diameter variations on fibre tensile behaviour. In addition, fit to the Weibull distribution by the non-brittle and non-uniform visco-elastic wool fibres is examined, and the Weibull model is developed further for non-uniform fibres with diameter variation along the fibre length. A novel model fibre composite is introduced to facilitate the investigation into the tensile behaviour of fibre-reinforced composites.
This work first confirms that for processed wool, its coefficient of variation in break force can be predicted from that of minimum fibre diameters, and the prediction is better for longer fibres. This implies that even for processed wool, fibre breakage is closely associated with the occurrence of thin sections along a fibre, and damage to fibres during processing is not the main cause of fibre breakage.
The effect of along-fibre diameter variation on fibre tensile behaviour of scoured wool and mohair is examined next. Only wet wool samples were examined in the past. The extensions of individual segments of single non-uniform fibres are measured at different strain levels. An important finding is the maximum extension (%) (Normally at the thinnest section) equals the average fibre extension (%) plus the diameter variation (CV %) among the fibre segments. This relationship has not been reported before. During a tensile test, it is only the average fibre extension that is measured.
The third part of this work is on the applicability of Weibull distribution to the strength of non-uniform visco-elastic wool fibres. Little work has been done for wool fibres in this area, even though the Weibull model has been widely applied to many brittle fibres. An improved Weibull model incorporating within-fibre diameter variations has been developed for non-uniform fibres. This model predicts the gauge length effect more accurately than the conventional Weibull model.
In studies of fibre-reinforced composites, ideal composite specimens are usually prepared and used in the experiments. Sample preparation has been a tedious process. A novel fibre reinforced composite is developed and used in this work to investigate the tensile behaviour of fibre-reinforced composites. The results obtained from the novel composite specimen are consistent with that obtained from the normal specimens.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">textile fibres</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="subject">wool</field><field name="subject">mohair</field><field name="subject">Weibull distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.143549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australia-Indonesia security relationship.</field><field name="creator">Mead, Jonathan</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">national security</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">foreign relations</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.144017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fuzzy neural networks for control of dynamic systems.</field><field name="creator">Frayman, Yakov</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a unified and comprehensive treatment of the fuzzy neural networks as the intelligent controllers. This work has been motivated by a need to develop the solid control methodologies capable of coping with the complexity, the nonlinearity, the interactions, and the time variance of the processes under control. In addition, the dynamic behavior of such processes is strongly influenced by the disturbances and the noise, and such processes are characterized by a large degree of uncertainty.
Therefore, it is important to integrate an intelligent component to increase the control system ability to extract the functional relationships from the process and to change such relationships to improve the control precision, that is, to display the learning and the reasoning abilities. The objective of this thesis was to develop a self-organizing learning controller for above processes by using a combination of the fuzzy logic and the neural networks. An on-line, direct fuzzy neural controller using the process input-output measurement data and the reference model with both structural and parameter tuning has been developed to fulfill the above objective.
A number of practical issues were considered. This includes the dynamic construction of the controller in order to alleviate the bias/variance dilemma, the universal approximation property, and the requirements of the locality and the linearity in the parameters. Several important issues in the intelligent control were also considered such as the overall control scheme, the requirement of the persistency of excitation and the bounded learning rates of the controller for the overall closed loop stability. Other important issues considered in this thesis include the dependence of the generalization ability and the optimization methods on the data distribution, and the requirements for the on-line learning and the feedback structure of the controller. Fuzzy inference specific issues such as the influence of the choice of the defuzzification method, T-norm operator and the membership function on the overall performance of the controller were also discussed. In addition, the e-completeness requirement and the use of the fuzzy similarity measure were also investigated.
Main emphasis of the thesis has been on the applications to the real-world problems such as the industrial process control. The applicability of the proposed method has been demonstrated through the empirical studies on several real-world control problems of industrial complexity. This includes the temperature and the number-average molecular weight control in the continuous stirred tank polymerization reactor, and the torsional vibration, the eccentricity, the hardness and the thickness control in the cold rolling mills. Compared to the traditional linear controllers and the dynamically constructed neural network, the proposed fuzzy neural controller shows the highest promise as an effective approach to such nonlinear multi-variable control problems with the strong influence of the disturbances and the noise on the dynamic process behavior.
In addition, the applicability of the proposed method beyond the strictly control area has also been investigated, in particular to the data mining and the knowledge elicitation. When compared to the decision tree method and the pruned neural network method for the data mining, the proposed fuzzy neural network is able to achieve a comparable accuracy with a more compact set of rules. In addition, the performance of the proposed fuzzy neural network is much better for the classes with the low occurrences in the data set compared to the decision tree method. Thus, the proposed fuzzy neural network may be very useful in situations where the important information is contained in a small fraction of the available data.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intelligent control systems</field><field name="subject">computer science</field><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="subject">data mining</field><field name="subject">fuzzy</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.145550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elastic behaviour in mechanical draw presses.</field><field name="creator">Dingle, Matthew</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the elastic behaviour of the mechanical double action press and draw die system commonly used to draw sheet metal components in the automotive industry. High process variability in production and excessive time spent in die try-out are significant problems in automotive stamping. It has previously been suggested that the elastic behaviour of the system may contribute to these problems. However, the mechanical principles that cause the press system to affect the forming process have not been documented in detail. Due to a poor understanding of these problems in industry, the elasticity of the press and tools is currently not considered during the die design. The aim of this work was to explore the physical principles of press system elasticity and determine the extent to which it contributes to problems in try-out and production. On the basis of this analysis methods were developed for controlling or accounting for problems during the design process.
The application of frictional restraining force to the edges of the blank during forming depends on the distribution and magnitude of the clamping force between the binders surfaces of the draw die. This is an important control parameter for the deep drawing process. It has been demonstrated in this work that the elasticity of the press and draw die can affect clamping force in two ways. The response of the press system, to the forces produced in the press during forming, causes the magnitude of clamping force to change during the stroke. This was demonstrated using measured data from a production press. A simple linear elastic model of the press system was developed to illustrate a definite link between the measured force variation and the elasticity of the press and tools. The simple model was extended into a finite element model of the complete press system, which was used to control a forming simulation. It was demonstrated that stiffness variation within the system could influence the final strains in a drawn part. At the conclusion of this investigation a method is proposed for assessing the sensitivity of a part to clamping force variation in the press during die design. A means of reducing variation in the press through the addition of a simple linear spring element is also discussed.
The second part of the work assessed the influence of tool structure on the distribution of frictional restraining forces to the blank. A forming simulation showed that tool stiffness affects the distribution of clamping pressure between the binders. This was also shown to affect the final strains in a drawn part. However, the most significant influence on restraining force was the tendency of the blank to increase in thickness between the binders during forming. Using a finite element approximation of the try-out process it was shown that the structure of the tool would also contribute to the problems currently experienced in try-out where uneven contact pressure distributions are addressed by manually adjusting the tool surfaces.
Finally a generalised approach to designing draw die structures was developed. Simple analysis methods were combined with finite element based topology optimisation techniques to develop a set of basic design guidelines. The aim of the guidelines was to produce a structure with uniform stiffness response to a pressure applied at the binder surface.
The work concludes with a recommendation for introducing the methods developed in this thesis into the standard production process.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheet-steel</field><field name="subject">motor vehicles</field><field name="subject">design and construction</field><field name="subject">dies</field><field name="subject">metal working</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.150247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic studies towards anthraquinones</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Anthony Stewart</field><field name="description">The oxidation of substituted phenols with phenyliodonium diacetate in methanol was found to afford 2,4-cyclohexadienones, 2,5-cyclohexadienones or mixtures of isomers depending on the substrate being oxidized.

The psychologists were selected from the Australian Psychological Society (APS) Directory of Psychologists, 1992- 1993. A total of 86 rural psychologists and 282 urban psychologists responded to the survey. The survey comprised of four sections with questions asking respondents their demographic and employment background, past and current training activities, work experience, and relations with community. Results showed that the decision to practice and remain in a rural area was influenced by psychologists&#146; childhood experience and professional training in a rural setting, A substantial proportion of rural psychologists (28%) had been working in rural practice for five years or less. These rural psychologists were identified as a group that had a demographic and training profile more similar to urban psychologists than their rural colleagues. The employment conditions and training background of rural and urban psychologists were similar, though rural psychologists were more likely to be working in private practice and have undertaken their studies in a rural setting. Rural and urban psychologists rated their undergraduate and postgraduate training in psychology as only somewhat adequate. Training in rural health and community issues received the lowest ratings from both groups of psychologists. The work practices of rural and urban psychologists were also similar. There were some differences in the demographic profile of the client groups seen by the two groups. Rural psychologists reported the type of relations with their communities that are conducive to rural practice. The main evidence of this was that rural psychologists were collaborating with the natural helpers of their communities, and expressed willingness to formally train natural helpers to assist in the provision of psychological services. There were several conclusions drawn from this study. The first conclusion was that rural psychologists with urban demographic and training backgrounds are a group that is likely to migrate from rural practice to urban practice, Secondly, training needs to be specialised for rural practice if there is to be an improvement in the number of psychologists practicing in rural settings. Thirdly, rural psychologists were conducting the type of relations with their communities that are important to the requirements of rural practice.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychologists</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">practice</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.152139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secularism exhausted?: Non-Indigenous postcolonial discourses and the question of aboriginal religion.</field><field name="creator">Drake, Darren</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aboriginal Australian</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.152649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into the skill levels achieved by mathematics students in the V.C.E. and the H.S.C. mathematics courses.</field><field name="creator">Swedosh, Philip</field><field name="description">This study examines whether recent changes to the mathematics courses offered in the final year of secondary school (Year 12) in the state of Victoria, Australia have affected the learning outcomes of students in terms of then: skill levels in algebra, calculus and problem solving; and in terms of their preparation for a tertiary mathematics unit. The impact of these changes on the transition from secondary to tertiary mathematics is also considered.
A comparison is made between students who attempted a first year mathematics unit at the University of Melbourne (U. of M.) having completed the new V.C.E. (Victorian Certificate of Education) mathematics courses and mathematics courses from the previous H.S.C. (Higher School Certificate) system. The comparison involves the use of tests administered upon entrance to a tertiary mathematics unit at the U. of M., and questionnaires.
In 1991, V.C.E, students and H.S.C. students attempted the same mathematics test at the U. of M. and their results were compared. In 1992, the tests were attempted by V.C.E. students only. To compare new V.C.E. students and H.S.C. students, questions on the 1991 test were matched with similar questions on the 1992 tests and a panel of experts determined what the H.S.C. students who attempted the 1991 test would have been expected to average on these matched questions on the 1992 tests had they attempted them. These expected average scores were then compared with the actual scores of the new V.C.E. students. The scores of the groups were scaled when necessary.
Questionnaires were administered to 1991 U. of M, mathematics students who were part of the V.C.E. pilot group in 1990, secondary mathematics educators, tertiary mathematics educators, and 1991 V.C.E. (1992 U. of M.) students.
The mathematical misconceptions exhibited by new V.C.E. students are discussed and their frequencies stated.
The research indicates that the new V.C.E. mathematics courses have provided the V.C.E. mathematics students in this study with significantly lower skill levels and a significantly poorer preparation for a tertiary mathematics unit than those which were previously provided by the H.S.C. mathematics courses.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">secondary education</field><field name="subject">curricula</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Victorian Certificate of Education examination</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">VCE</field><field name="subject">HSC</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.153947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the pedagogical process in physical education teacher education.</field><field name="creator">Cassidy, Tania G.</field><field name="description">The study investigated two main questions: the first focused on the factors that enabled and constrained student teachers' engagement of a socially critical pedagogy in physical education teacher education (PETE); the second centered on gaining insight into the usefulness of knowledgeability as a concept for analysing student teachers engagement of a socially critical pedagogy. At the time of writing this thesis empirical analyses of socially critical pedagogies in physical education were rare in the educational literature. The study provided an alternative way of analysing student teachers&#146; engagement of a socially critical pedagogy in PETE. Alternative in that it avoided recycling and reproducing the dualism between agency and structure (Aronowitz and Giroux, 1985) that is prevalent in much of the physical education literature.
Conversational interviews were conducted with four student teachers and their teacher educators throughout the duration of a one-semester PETE unit in an Australian university. Observations were made of the lecture and practical sessions and a document analysis was conducted of all unit learning resources. The analytical frame used in the study was structuration theory (Giddens, 1979, 1984). This framework was useful because it gave primacy to the duality of structure which recognised &#145;the structural properties of social systems are both the medium and outcome of practices that constitute those systems&#146; (Giddens, 1979, p.69).
The pedagogical intentions of the teacher educator co-ordinating the PETE unit were to change the orientations of the student teachers towards primary school physical education by encouraging them to adopt different &#145;lenses&#146; through which to examine pedagogical practices. These &#145;lenses&#146; highlighted the questions central to those with socio-critical intentions, eg. power, social injustice and diversity. Data generated from conversations with, and observations of, the student teachers, indicated that the actualisation of the teacher educator's intentions were somewhat limited.
Despite this, adopting structuration theory as the explanatory framework for the study proved generative at a number of levels. Broadly, structuration theory was useful because it highlighted the way that student teachers' engagement with a socially critical pedagogy is contingent upon particular (idiosyncratic) dialectics of agency and structure. Using the duality of structure as an analytical tool illustrated the way student teachers' were influenced by structural factors as well as the way these structural factors were in turn constituted by the action of the student teachers. Also, by utilising structuration theory as an explanatory framework, the concept of knowledgeability was identified as a useful concept for analysing student teachers' engagement with a socially critical pedagogy in PETE. What is more, the study highlighted the reflexivity of the self and social knowledge, both characteristics of late modernity, as being integral to the way the student teachers engaged with the socially critical pedagogy of EAE400.
Not only did the study highlight the reflexivity of the self but it also provided insight into the reflexivity of social knowledge. Much of the socially critical work in physical education implicitly adopts a linear approach to change. Given the findings of the study it might be useful for future developments to consider change as circular. The thesis concludes by suggesting that given the reflexivity of social knowledge, socially critical perspectives might be more readily engaged if the PETE content was incorporated into student teachers existing knowledge frameworks rather than viewed as a replacement for such frameworks.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">physical education teacher education</field><field name="subject">PETE</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.154748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reforming Australian public sector accounting: An episode of institutional thinking.</field><field name="creator">Potter, Bradley N</field><field name="description">In recent years in Australia, accounting reforms have been developed which have resulted in the application of commercial systems of accounting to diverse public sector organisations. The reforms, which include the requirement to recognise infrastructure and heritage resources as assets in financial reports, endorse financial notions of accountability and performance that have been traditionally applied within private sector, profit-seeking organisations. Such notions are applied to a range of public sector organisations for the first time, even though the primary missions or objectives of many of these organisations are social, rather than financial in orientation. This critical, interpretative case study, set within the context of not-for-profit public museums, seeks to enhance an understanding of public sector accounting change based on these unique social organisations.
The study examines three aspects of the reforms, namely, their development, their promotion and their defence. This examination is undertaken using the ideas contained in Mary Douglas&#146; (1986) How Institutions Think as the key theoretical construct. The supplementary perspectives of problematisation and epistemic communities are used to assist in applying the primary theoretical construct by explaining how, and by whom, these reforms were advocated and implemented in this specific instance. The study shows how the interpretation and application of the statements comprising the conceptual framework have shaped the development, promotion and defence of detailed standards developed for specific public sector organisations. In doing so, the study addresses two key research questions: (1) How were financial notions of accountability and performance of Australian public sector organisations constructed during the period 1976-2001 and articulated in the CF, once its development began, within this reform period? (2) How were these notions and other concepts of financial reporting outlined in the CF interpreted and applied in the (i) development; (ii) promotion; and (iii) defence of detailed accounting standards for not-for-profit public museums in Australia during the period under investigation?
The study demonstrates that the concepts of financial reporting outlined in the conceptual framework were used by a relatively small group of technical experts located in influential positions in accounting regulation and in other fields to justify the application of accrual accounting within diverse public sector organisations. During the period examined, only certain questions were posed and certain issues considered and many problems associated with the implementation of the reforms were not considered. Accordingly, a key finding of the study is that each aspect of the reform period was guided and constrained by institutional thinking.  In addition, the study shows how the framework's content can be used to permit equally well-argued, but conflicting, accounting policies to be adopted and defended for the same items, indicating the framework to be of only limited value as a technical tool. This leads to another key finding of the study, namely, that the framework is best understood as a political tool, serving a crucial role in enabling accrual accounting reforms to be developed, promoted and defended within the public sector. Thus, the study seeks to offer an enhanced understanding of the nature and determinants of accounting change, and accordingly, it broadens an understanding of the use of the conceptual framework, as an institution, in developing, promoting and defending changes to accounting practice.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public sector finance</field><field name="subject">accounting</field><field name="subject">Standards Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051017.155728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of the dimensions that relate to the effectiveness of training systems: A systems approach.</field><field name="creator">Selvarajah, Christopher T</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to explore dimensions that relate to the training systems effectiveness in a number of industry categories. The training system is taken as part of the reproducer boundary subsystem within the organisation (Miller 1978).
The research has been developed on the assumption that no single criterion is appropriate as a measure of effectiveness of a training system (Campbell et al 1970). An index of criteria based on the different organisational variables that interact within an organisation is employed in the development of the study. In this research the structural variables (independent variables) including industry category, size and formalisation factors of the sample organisations will be related to the effectiveness of training systems in their organisations.
This research attempts to formulate hypotheses in the field of training system research to contribute to a theory of training system impact studies. The popular areas of research in the field of training have mainly tended to focus separately on the effectiveness of training programmes, the economics of training, the social impact of training and the dynamics of training.

In particular, the thesis examines the historical performance of the GRC from the time of its establishment in August 1977 to its abolition in May 1993.
The GRC Commissioners were subject to ongoing criticism by some elements of the region's political, business, rural and local government sectors. This criticism focused on the Commissioners' policies on land-use planning, their interventionist stance on industrial land development, major projects and industry protection and their activities in revitalising the Geelong central business district. This thesis examines these criticisms in the light of the Commission's overall performance.
This thesis found that, as a statutory authority of the Victorian Government, the GRC was successful over its lifetime, when measured against the requirements of the Geelong Regional Commission Act, the Commission's corporate planning objectives and performance indicators, the corporate performance standards of private enterprise in the late 1990s, and the performance indicator standards of today's regional economic development organisations in the United States of America, parts of the United Kingdom and Australia.
With the change of Government in Victoria in October 1992 came a new approach to regional development. The new Government enacted legislation to amalgamate six of the nine local government councils of the Geelong region and returned regional planning responsibilities to the newly formed City of Greater Geelong Council. The new Government also made economic development a major objective of local government. As a result, the raison d'etre for the GRC came to an end and the organisation was abolished.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geelong Regional Commission</field><field name="subject">GRC</field><field name="subject">geelong</field><field name="subject">regional commissions</field><field name="subject">Geelong Regional Commissions Act</field><field name="subject">local politics</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.105014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Double disability: Lived experience of Australian Tertiary Students with ME/CFS.</field><field name="creator">Morris, Dorothy</field><field name="description">This research is the exploration of the lived experience of tertiary students in Australia with the medical condition usually known as ME/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis /Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) seeking to explore issues of equity and human rights from the perspective of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. Students feel that their difficulties are not caused just by the illness itself but by the failure of the tertiary institutions to understand the effects of this illness on them, the student, especially within the areas of accommodations and assessments. Their lived experiences are studied to ascertain if their experiences differ from those of other tertiary students. Forty participants came from every state and territory of Australia and twenty -four of Australia's universities as well as eight Technical and Further Education/Open Training Education Network (TAFE/OTEN) colleges are represented. The selection of the chosen methodology, Critical Ethnography from a Habermasian perspective, has been circumscribed by the medical condition which placed limitations on methodology and also data gathering methods. Non-structured stories, in which the participants wrote of their lived experience as students, were considered the most appropriate source of data. These were transmitted by electronic mail (with some by postal mail) to the researcher. A short questionnaire provided a participant background to the stories and was also collated for a composite overview of the participants. The stories are analysed in a number of ways: six selected stories are retold and the issues arising from these stories have been weighed against the remainder of the stories. Four intertwined themes were constructed from the issues raised in each story. Apparent infringements of the Disability Discrimination Act (1992) which impact on quality of life, human rights and equity are found. No accommodations are being made by the academic institutions for the cognitive dysfunctions and learning difficulties. Students are stigmatised and lack credibility to negotiate appropriate academic accommodations. A possible means of improving the ability of students to negotiate appropriate accommodations is explored. Finally the researcher reflects on her own involvement in the research as an 'insider' researcher.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ME/CFS</field><field name="subject">multiple disabilities</field><field name="subject">myalgic encephalomyelitis</field><field name="subject">chronic fatigue syndrome</field><field name="subject">disability discrimination act 1992</field><field name="subject">students with disabilities</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">people with disabilities</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.110308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A grounded theory of nursing's contribution to inpatient rehabilitation.</field><field name="creator">Pryor, Julie Anne</field><field name="description">There is growing awareness of the benefits of rehabilitation both in Australia and overseas. While the provision of rehabilitation services is not new, recognition of this type of health service as an integral part of health care has been linked to changes in the provision of acute care services, advances in medical technology, improvements in the management of trauma and an ageing population. Despite this, little attention has been paid to nursing's contribution to patient rehabilitation in Australia. The aim of this grounded theory study, therefore, was to collect and analyse nurses' reports of their contributions to patient rehabilitation and to describe and analyse contextual factors influencing that contribution.
Data were collected during interviews with registered and enrolled nurses working in five inpatient rehabilitation units in New South Wales and during observation of the nurses' everyday practice. A total of 53 nurses participated in the study, 35 registered nurses and 18 enrolled nurses. Grounded theory, informed by the theoretical perspective of symbolic interactionism, was used to guide data analysis, the ongoing collection of data and the generation of a substantive theory.
The findings revealed six major categories. One was an everyday problem labelled incongruence between nurses' and patients' understandings and expectations of rehabilitation. Another category, labelled coaching patients to self-care, described how nurses independently negotiated the everyday problem of incongruence. The remaining four categories captured conditions in the inpatient context which influenced how nurses could contribute to patient rehabilitation. Two categories, labelled segregation: divided and dividing work practices between nursing and allied health and role ambiguity, were powerful in shaping nursing's contribution as they acted individually and synergistically to constrain nursing's contribution to patient rehabilitation. The other two categories, labelled distancing to manage systemic constraints and grasping the nettle to realise nursing's potential, represent the mutually exclusive strategies nurses used in response to segregation and role ambiguity.
From exploration of the relationship between the six categories, the core category and an interactive grounded theory called opting in and opting out emerged. In turn, this grounded theory reveals nursing's contribution to inpatient rehabilitation as well as contextual conditions constraining that contribution. The significance of these findings is made manifest through their contribution to the advancement of nursing knowledge and through implications for nursing practice and education, rehabilitation service delivery and research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inpatients</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">nursing practice</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation nursing</field><field name="subject">management of trauma</field><field name="subject">ageing population</field><field name="subject">patient rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.112022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reinvigorating the public sphere: The role of voluntary associations.</field><field name="creator">Prince, John</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the key question: can voluntary associations enhance democracy? It tests critical claims made by Habermas and others that voluntary associations have the potential to reinvigorate a public sphere in a state of atrophy. The thesis outlines the major theoretical arguments pertaining to these areas and then presents the results of empirical work within voluntary organisations.
Specifically the thesis:
Critically examines the concept of the public sphere, being a sphere between the state and civil society and investigates why theorists have advocated voluntary associations, claimed to be the core institutions of civil society, as sites where democratic ideals can be secured;
Goes on to examine the concept of civil society and reviews the recent literature that has attempted to define and analyse the role of voluntary associations in contemporary society;
Tests empirically the normative ideals that have been advocated on behalf of voluntary associations through the presentation of data obtained using qualitative methodology. The analysis of the data collected during interviews with key employees and members of six voluntary associations in Melbourne, Australia allows for a more informed knowledge regarding the key concepts and themes of the thesis.
The thesis ends by directly addressing the following points: whether or not the public sphere is in a state of atrophy; the particular nature of voluntary associations contemporary engagement in the public sphere; and whether voluntary associations can indeed, be sites where democracy can be enhanced and democratic ideals be secured. It is concluded that voluntary associations operate within Habermasian public spheres, counterspheres, and postmodern public spheres and that unitary notions of the public sphere, such as those Habermas proposes, do not adequately explain voluntary associations engagement in the public sphere. Accordingly, it is concluded that voluntary associations have the potential to invigorate public spheres, though not in ways that many theorists writing on the subject suggest.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">associations</field><field name="subject">institutions</field><field name="subject">voluntarism</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">civil society</field><field name="subject">democracy</field><field name="subject">public interest</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">voluntary associations</field><field name="subject">Habermas</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.114655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Content-based video indexing for sports applications using integrated multi-modal approach.</field><field name="creator">Tjondronegoro, Dian W</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a research work based on an integrated multi-modal approach for sports video indexing and retrieval.

Men's access to chronic illness (arthritis) self management programs.</field><field name="creator">Gibbs, Lisa</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the issue of men's access to chronic illness self management programs from a social constructionist perspective. A combination of research methodologies was used; a quantitative analysis to confirm gender differences in levels and patterns of service use; a qualitative analysis to gain an increased understanding of the factors affecting men's access; and a trial to test the application of the research findings. The clients and services of Arthritis Victoria were chosen as the setting for this research.
The quantitative analyses were conducted on contingency tables and odds ratios and confirmed that men were under-represented as service users. The analyses also identified gender differences in patterns of service use. The qualitative analysis was based on a series of in-depth, semi-structured interviews. It was undertaken from a grounded theory approach to allow for the development of theoretical explanations grounded in the data. It was found that men's decisions to access chronic illness self management programs were strongly influenced by dominant social constructions of masculinity which constrained help-seeking and health management behaviour. However, the restrictive influence of hegemonic masculinity was progressively undermined by the increasing severity of the chronic condition until a crisis point was reached in terms of the severity of the condition or its impact on lifestyle. This resulted in a reformulation or rejection of hegemonic masculinity. The described conceptual framework was consistent for men from diverse social groupings, although it appeared less prominent in both younger and older men, suggesting that dominant social constructions of masculinity have the greatest influence on health decisions during the middle stage of adulthood when work and family obligations are greatest.
The thesis findings informed the development of some guiding principles for reviewing the structure and delivery of chronic illness self management services for men. The guiding principles will have direct application in the planning of Arthritis Victoria programs, and implications for other chronic illness self management programs in Australia, and also in Western countries with a similar health and sociocultural setting to Australia.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">men;s health</field><field name="subject">hygiene</field><field name="subject">chronic diseases</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">arthritis</field><field name="subject">patient education</field><field name="subject">self-care</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Arthritis Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.130916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towering over all the Italianate Villa in the colonial landscape.</field><field name="creator">Hubbard, Timothy Fletcher</field><field name="description">The Picturesque aesthetic emerged in the later 18th century, uniting the Sublime and the Beautiful and had its roots in the paintings of Claude Lorrain. In Britain, and in Australia, it came to link art, literature and landscape with architecture. The Picturesque aesthetic informed much of colonial culture which was achieved, in part, through the production and dissemination of architectural pattern books catering for the aspirations of the rising middle classes. This was against a background of political change including democratic reform.
The Italianate villa, codified and promoted in such pattern books, was a particularly successful synthesis of style, form and function. The first Italianate villa in England, Cronkhill (1803) by John Nash contains all the ingredients which were essential to the model and had a deeper meaning. Deepdene (from 1807) by Thomas Hope gave the model further impetus. The works of Charles Barry and others in a second generation confirmed the model's acceptability. In Britain, its public status peaked with Osborne House (from 1845), Queen Victoria's Italianate villa on the Isle of Wight, Robert Kerr used a vignette of Osborne House on the title page of his sophisticated and influential pattern book, The Gentleman's House (1864,1871). It was one of many books, including those of J.C, Loudon and AJ. Downing, current in colonial Victoria. The latter authors and horticulturists were themselves villa dwellers with libraries and orchards, two criteria for the true villa lifestyle.
Situation and a sense of retreat were the two further criteria for the villa lifestyle. As the new colony of Victoria blossomed between 1851 and 1891, the Italianate villa, its garden setting and its landscape siting captured the tenor of the times. Melbourne, the capital was a rich manufacturing metropolis with a productive hinterland and international markets. The people enjoyed a prosperity and lifestyle which they wished to display. Those who had a position in society were keen to demonstrate and protect it. Those with aspirations attempted to provide the evidence necessary for such acceptance, The model matured and became ubiquitous. Its evolution can be traced through a series of increasingly complicated rural and suburban examples, a process which modernist historians have dismissed as a decadent decline. These villas, in fact, demonstrate an increasingly sophisticated retreat by merchants from &#145;the Town&#146; and by graziers from &#145;the Country&#146;. In both town and country, the towers of villas mark territory newly acquired. The same claim was often made in humbler situations.
Government House, Melbourne (from 1871), a splendid Italianate villa and arguably finer than Osborne House, was set in a cultivated landscape and towered above all It incorporated the four criteria and, in addition, claimed its domain, focused authority and established the colony's social status. It symbolised ancient notions of democracy and idealism but with a modem appreciation for the informal and domestic. Government House in Melbourne is the epitome of the Italianate villa in the colonial landscape and is the climax of the Picturesque aesthetic in Victoria.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">colonial</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Italian architecture</field><field name="subject">Melbourne</field><field name="subject">government house melbourne</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.132654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exchange as a determinant in corporate citizenship : Exploratory action research into the social construction of corporate citizenship.</field><field name="creator">Glazebrook, Mark</field><field name="description">This study attempts to achieve two things. Firstly it contextualizes corporate citizenship drawing on scholarly, government, media, legal and business discourses which when viewed as a whole, reveals the importance of exchange as a central determinant in how all the major themes or subfields of corporate citizenship function and subsequently become valued within public discourse. Secondly, it reports on exploratory action research where I as a researcher occupied a central role in understanding and contributing towards how organizational settings socially construct and evolve corporate citizenship in real time through various exchange behaviour, drawing from four years field research within BP and its interactions with the external world.
This research contributes to new knowledge by building a rare contextual understanding into how cultural change evolves over time within an organization, from its public face, through policy, down into employee and stakeholder reactions, including identifying the crucial role played by Cultural bridges&#146; in shifting entrenched organizational culture towards embracing new, more sustainable ways of doing business, and additionally how practitioners can legitimately act as a researcher in facilitating this process by assisting an organization to move from simple, transactional relationships to more sustainable integrated social, financial and environmental exchange between business and its broader context. Importantly, this research develops entirely new theoretical models for understanding the social application and commercial value of corporate citizenship to both business and society.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social responsibility of business</field><field name="subject">corporate citizenship</field><field name="subject">corporate citizenship</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.133416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding educational process in leadership development.</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Keith Trevor</field><field name="description">This thesis is a case study of educational process in the leadership development program of the Australian Defence Force Academy. The intention is to determine the relative emphasis in educational process on the conventional command and managerial compliance (Type A) style and the emergent contingent and creative (Type B) style of leadership. The Type A style is theorised as emphasizing hierarchy and control, whereas the emphasis in a Type B style is on adaptive and entrepreneurial behaviour. This study looks at the learning process in a cultural and structural context rather than focus on curriculum and instructional design. Research in this wider context is intended to enable development processes to successfully bridge a gap between theory and practice, implicit in studies that identify theories 'in-operation' as different from the theories 'espoused' (Argyris 1992, Savage 1996).
In terms of espoused and in-use theory, the study seeks to produce a valid and reliable result to the question: what is the relative emphasis on the two leadership styles in the operation of the three educational mechanisms of curriculum, pedagogy (teaching practice) and assessment? The quantitative analysis of results (n = 114) draws attention to both leadership styles in terms of two and three-way relationships of style, cadet or work group and service type. The data shows that both Type A and Type B leadership styles are evident in the general conversation of the organisation. This trend is present as espoused theory in the curriculum of the Defence Academy. However, the data also confirm a clear and strong emphasis towards command and managerial compliance as theory-in-use, particularly by cadets. This emphasis is noticeably evident in the teaching and assessment practice of the Defence Academy. Other research outcomes include the observation that:
Contextually, while studies show it is difficult to isolate skills from their cultural and biographical context (Watkins, 1991:15), this study suggests that it is equally difficult to isolate skills development from this context.
There is a strong task or instrumental link identified by cadet responses in terms of content and development process at the Defence Academy, in contrast to the wider developmental emphasis in general literature and senior officer interviews.
There is a lack of awareness of teaching strategies and development activity consistent with espoused Type B leadership theory and curriculum content. This gap is compounded by the use in the Defence Academy of personnel without teaching expertise or suitable developmental experience.
The socialisation of cadets into the military workplace is the primary purpose of training. This purpose appears taken for granted by all concerned - staff, cadets and senior officers.
Defence Academy development processes appear to be faced with a dilemma. Arguably, training and learning from experience are limited approaches to development. Training, which involves learning by replication, and learning from experience, which is largely imitative, are both of little use when people are faced with novel and ambiguous situations. This study suggests that in order to support the development of capabilities that go beyond training based competence a learning and development approach is needed. This more expansive approach requires educational planners to consider the cultural and social context that can inadvertently promote the status quo in practice over espoused outcomes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">army</field><field name="subject">army officers</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">Australian Defence Force Academy</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">command of troops</field><field name="subject">military education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.134710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The repair and tolerance of DNA damage in higher plants.</field><field name="creator">Vonarx, Edward J</field><field name="description">DNA repair mechanisms constitute an essential cellular response to DNA damage arising either from metabolic processes or from environmental sources such as ultraviolet radiation. Repair of these lesions may be via direct reversal, or by processes such as nucleotide excision repair (NER), a coordinated pathway in which lesions and the surrounding nucleotides are excised and replaced via DNA resynthesis. The importance of repair is illustrated by human disease states such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome which result from defects in the NER system arising from mutations in XP- genes or XP- and CS- genes respectively
Little detail is known of DNA damage repair processes in plants, despite the economic and ecological importance of these organisms. This study aimed to expand our knowledge of the process of NER in plants, largely via a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach involving amplification, cloning and characterisation of plant genomic DNA and cDNA. Homologues of the NER components XPF/RAD1 and XPD/RAD3 were isolated as both genomic and complete cDNA sequences from the model dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The sequence of the 3'-untranslated region of atXPD was also determined. Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences allowed a detailed analysis of gene structures, including details of intron/exon processing. Variable transcript processing to produce three distinct transcripts was found in the case of atXPF. In an attempt to validate the proposed homologous function of these cDNAs, assays to test complementation of resistance to ultraviolet radiation in the relevant yeast mutants were performed. Despite extensive amino acid sequence conservation, neither plant cDNA was able to restore UV-resistance. As the yeast RAD3 gene product is also involved in vivo in transcription, and so is required for viability, the atXPD cDNA was tested in a complementation assay for this function in an appropriate yeast mutant. The plant cDNA was found to substantially increase the viability of the yeast mutant.
The structural and functional significance of these results is discussed comparatively with reference to yeast, human and other known homologues. Other putative NER homologues were identified in A. thaliana database sequences, including those of ERCC1/RAD10 and XPG/ERCC5/RAD2, and are now the subjects of ongoing investigations. This study also describes preliminary investigations of putative REVS and RAD30 translesion synthesis genes from A. thaliana.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA repair</field><field name="subject">DNA damage</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.135641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The adventures of punctuated equilibria.

Colonialism is a process whereby incommensurate gender regimes impact differently on women and men and this is reflected in the indigenous response which affects the socialization of Western things.
The notion of the indigenous KIRDA-KURDUNGURLU reciprocity is shown to be consistent with a gender system and to articulate all exchange relations as pro-creative social relationships. This contrasts with the Western capitalist system of production and social reproduction of gendered individuals in that it does not ascribe gender to biological differences between women and men but is derived from a land based social division between Sister-Brother.
Social relationships are put under great strain in an effort to socialize Western things for Warlpiri internal use,
I argue that the colonization of Aboriginal societies is an ongoing process. Despite the historical shift from a physical all-male frontier to the present day cross-cultural negotiations between Aborigines and Non-Aborigines, men still privilege men. The negotiation process for ownership of a Community Toyota is the most recent phenomenon where this can be observed. Male privilege is established by linking control over the access to the Community Toyota with traditional rights to land.
However, the Toyota as Western object has a Western gender identity as well. By pitting women against men it engages people in social conflict which is brought into existence through an organisation of Western concepts based on an alien gender regime.
But Western things, especially the Community Toyota, resist socialization because the Warlpiri do not produce these things. Warlpiri people know this and, to satisfy their need for Western things, they engage them in a process of social differentiation. By this process they can be seen actively to maintain the Western system in an effort to maintain themselves as Warlpiri and to secure the production of Western things.
This investigation of the cultural response to Western influences shows that indigenous gender relations are only maintained through a socially stressful process of socializing Western things.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Warlpiri</field><field name="subject">Australian people</field><field name="subject">social life</field><field name="subject">customs</field><field name="subject">culture conflict</field><field name="subject">Kurdungurlu</field><field name="subject">aborigines</field><field name="subject">aboriginal communities</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.142617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The second person: A point of view? The function of the second-persn pronoun in narrative prose fiction.</field><field name="creator">Schofield, Dennis</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the functions and effects of the &#145;second-person&#146; pronoun in narrative prose fiction, with particular focus on the fluidity and ambiguity of the mode that I will call Protean-'you.' It is a mode in which it is unclear whether the &#145;you&#146; is a character, the narrator, a reader/narratee, or no-one in particular&#151;or a combination of these&#151;so that readers find &#145;second-person&#146; utterances at once familiar and deeply strange. I regard the &#145;second person&#146; as a special case of narrative &#145;person&#146; that, at its most fluid, can produce an experience of reading quite unlike that of reading traditional &#145;first-&#145; and &#145;third-person&#146; narrative. Essentially, this unique experience comes about because Protean-&#145;you&#146; neglects to constitute the stable modes of subjectivity that readers expect to find within narrative textuality. These stable modes of subjectivity, modelled on what I will refer to as Cartesianism&#146;s hegemonic notion of the self, have been thoroughly formalised and naturalised within the practices of &#145;first-&#145; and &#145;third-person&#146; narrative. The Protean-&#145;you&#146; form of &#145;second-person&#146; narrative, conversely, is a mode of narrative discourse that puts readers in a place of doubt and uncertainty, its unsettling equivocations forcefully disrupting accustomed, mimetic explanations of narrative and denying us access to the foundational, authorising subject of classical Cartesian thought.
Rather than founding a notion of &#145;second-person&#146; narrative and narrative &#145;person&#146; generally on Cartesianism's &#145;self-ish&#146; logic of unified, privatised identity, I turn to C.S, Peirce's notion of the semiotic self and to developments in post-structuralist thought. Essentially, the conception of subjectivity underpinning my arguments is Peirce's proposition that the self is to be conceived of not as a cogito, but as a sign by which the conscious entity knows itself. It is a sign, moreover, that is constantly being re-read, reinterpreted, so that identity is never self-complete. This reconception of subjectivity is necessary because 1 will argue that the effects of Protean-&#145;you&#146; arise in some part from a tension between Cartesianism's hegemony and what philosophical pragmatism and post-structuralism glimpse as the actual condition of the human subject&#151;the subject as dispersed and contingent rather than unified and authoritative.
Most discussions of &#145;second-person&#146; narrative conceive of the mode in terms of implicit communicative relations, in some measure instituting Cartesianism's notion of the intentionalist self at the centre of literary meaning. I contrast the paradigmatic address model that arises from this conception against a model that approaches the
 
analysis of &#145;second-person&#146; narrative modality in terms of a referential function, that is, in terms of the object or objects referred to deictically by the &#145;second-person&#146; pronoun. Two principal functions of &#145;second-person&#146; textuality are identified and discussed at length. The first is generalisation, which is rarely dissipated altogether, a situation that contributes to the ambiguities of the pronoun's reference in much &#145;second-person&#146; fiction. The second principal function is that of address, that is, the allocutionary function.
Clearly, although stories that continually refer to a &#145;you&#146; can seem quite baffling and unnatural, not all &#145;second-person&#146; narratives unsettle the reader. In order to make the &#145;second person's&#146; outlandish narratives knowable and stable, we bring to bear on them in our habits of reading whatever hermeneutic frames, whatever interpretive keys, come to hand, including a large number of unexceptional forms of literary and &#145;natural&#146; discourse that employ the &#145;second-person&#146; pronoun. These forms include letter writing and internal dialogue (i.e., talking to one's self), the language of the courtroom, the travelogue, the maxim, and so on. In looking at the ways in which the radicalising potentials of &#145;second-person&#146; discourse are contained or recuperated, I focus on issues of vraisemblance and mimesis. Vraisemblance can be described as the &#145;system of conventions and expectations which rests on/reinforces that more general system of &#145;mutual knowledge&#146; produced within a community for the realisation and maintenance of a whole social world&#146;. All of the forms of the vraisemblable are already instituted within social, cultural relations, so that what vraisemblance describes is the way we fit the inscriptions we read-that is, the way in which we naturalise what we read-into those given cultural and social forms. I also look at the conventionalising and naturalising work done by notions of mimesis in explaining relations between the world, our being in it, and texts, proposing that mimesis provides a principle buttress by which the good standing of the metaphor of &#145;person&#146; is preserved in traditional and pre-critical modes of analysis. Indeed, the critic&#146;s recourse to &#145;person&#146; is in some measure always an engagement with mimesis. Any discussion that maintains that mimesis is in some way productive of meaning-which this thesis in fact does-must identify mimesis as a merely conventional category within practices of reading and semiosis more generally, and at the very least remove that term from its traditional position of transparent primacy and authority.
Some of the most interesting and insightful arguments about &#145;second-person&#146; narrative propose that the &#145;second person&#146;s&#146; most striking effects derive from the constitution of an &#145;intersubjective&#146; experience of reading in which the subject positions of the &#145;you&#146;-protagonist, reader-narratee and narrator are combined into a fluid and indeterminate multiple subjectivity. Notions of intersubjectivity frequently position themselves as liberating the reader from Cartesianism's fixed,
 
authoritative modes of subjectivity, Frequently, however, they tend implicitly to reinstate Cartesianism's notion of the self at the centre of textual practice and subjectivity. I look at Daniel Gunn's novel &#145;Almost You&#146;, at length in this context, illustrating the constant overdetermination of the &#145;you&#146; and the novel's narrating voice, and demonstrating that this overdetermination leaves the origin of the narrative discourse, the identity of the narrator, and the ontological nature of both principal protagonists utterly ambiguous. The fluidity and ambiguity of Protean-&#145;you&#146; in &#145;Almost You&#146; is discussed in terms of &#145;second-person&#146;  intersubjectivity, but with a view to demonstrating the indebtedness by the notion of intersubjectivity to Cartesianism's hegemony of &#145;person&#146;.  I then turn to a discussion of what might be a more &#145;old fashioned&#146; if perhaps ultimately more far-reaching approach to the &#145;second person&#146;s&#146; often startling ambiguities. This is Keats's notion of negative capability, a capacity or quality in which a person &#145;is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.&#146;
I suggest that Protean-&#145;you&#146; texts will license all of the readings of ambiguity and fluidity proposed in my discussion of &#145;Almost You&#146;, but conclude that the instances of indeterminacy illustrate no more than that: the fluidity and deep ambiguity, and thus, finally, the lack of coherence, of Protean-&#145;you&#146; discourse. This has particular implications for how we are to consider readers&#146; experiences of narrative texts. More fundamentally, it has implications for how we are to consider readers as subjects. I suggest that unstable, ambiguous instances of &#145;second-person&#146; narrative can tear the complex and systematic embroidery of ideological suture that unifies Cretinism&#146;s experience or sense of subjectivity, leaving the reader in a condition of epistemological and ontological havoc.  I go on to argue that much of the deeply unsettling effect of Protean-&#145;you&#146; discourse anises because its utterances explicitly gesture towards Cretinism&#146;s notion of self. Protean-&#145;you&#146; involves a sense of address that is much more pronounced than we are accustomed to facing when reading literary narrative, alerting us to the presence of inscribed anthropomorphic subjects. At the very same time, protean-&#145;you&#146; leaves its inscribed subjects indeterminate, ambiguous. This conflict generates a tension between the anticipation of the emergence of speaking and listening selves and our inability to find them.
I go on to propose that Protean-&#145;you&#146; narrative's lack of coherence is also to be understood as the condition of narrative actuality generally, but a condition that is vigorously mediated against by dominant practices of reading and writing, hocusing my discussion in this respect on the issue of narrative &#145;person,&#146; I argue that narrative &#145;person&#146; is constituted within texts as an apparent unity, but that it is in fact, produced as unitary solely within the practice of making sense, that is,
 
Within our habits of reading, and so is never finally unified. I propose that this is the case for &#145;first-&#145; and &#145;third-person&#146; modes no less than for the &#145;second.&#146; Where &#145;second-person&#146; narrative at its most radical and Protean differs from conventional &#145;first-&#145; and &#145;third-person&#146; narratives is the degree to which each has been circumscribed by practices of tantalization, containment and limit, and, in particular, Cretinism&#146;s hegemony of &#145;person.&#146;  It may be that the most significant insights &#145;second-person&#146; narrative has to offer are to be found within its capacity to reveal to the engaged reader the underlying condition of narrative discourse, and more generally, its capacity to reveal the actual condition of the human subject-a condition in which, exactly like its textual corollary of narrative &#145;person,&#146; the self is glimpsed as thoroughly dispersed and contingent.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">history and criticism</field><field name="subject">narration</field><field name="subject">rhetoric</field><field name="subject">history and criticism</field><field name="subject">cartesianism</field><field name="subject">hegemony</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.150736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production system model of children's development of number concepts.</field><field name="creator">Nason, Rodney Allan</field><field name="description">The purpose of the present research study was to produce a global, cumulative model of number concept development for children between the ages of two and eight years old.
The theoretical and methodological orientation of this study was greatly influenced by Richard Young's production system analysis of seriation by young children (Young, 1971, 1976) and by Newell's (1973) seminal paper, &#145;You can't play twenty questions with nature and win&#146;. The methodology used in this investigation thus was as follows.  A series of complex number tasks encompassing many aspects of the concept of number were developed.  Five children aged between three and seven years then were videotaped while performing some of these complex number tasks.  From a detailed protocol analysis of the video-recordings, computer simulation models written in the production system language PSS3 (Ohlsson, 1979) were produced.
Specific production system models were produced for each of following aspects of the children's number knowledge:
(i)	sharing of discrete quantities;
(ii)	comparison of shares; and
(iii)	conservation/addition/subtraction of number.
These domain-specific models were based on the converging experimental evidence obtained from each of the children&#146;s responses to variants of the complex number tasks.  Each child thus received a different set of problems which were chosen systematically in order to clarify particular features of the child's abilities.  After a production system model for each child had been produced within a domain, these models were compared and contrasted.  From this analysis, developmental trends within the domain were identified and discussed.  The research and educational implications of these developmental trends then were discussed.
In the concluding parts of this study, the children's domain-specific production system models were cumulated into global, comprehensive models which accurately represented their behaviour in a variety of number tasks.  These comprehensive models were compared and contrasted and general developmental trends in young children's number knowledge were identified and discussed.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">number concept</field><field name="subject">children's development</field><field name="subject">production system models</field><field name="subject">Richard Young</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.152425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhizome/Myzone: The production of subjectivity in dance.</field><field name="creator">Vincs, Kim</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dance</field><field name="subject">dance criticism</field><field name="subject">modern dance</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">choreography</field><field name="subject">subjectivity</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.154532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Identification of novel genes differentially expressed in Haemopoietic progenitor cells.</field><field name="creator">Gregorio-King, Claudia C</field><field name="description">The biochemical and molecular processes that maintain the stem cell pool, and govern the proliferation and differentiation of haemopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) have been widely investigated but are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterise novel genes that may play a part in regulating the mechanisms that control the proliferation, differentiation and self-renewal of human HSPCs.
Reverse transcription differential display polymerase chain reaction (dd-PCR) was used to identify differences in gene expression between a HSPC population defined by expression of the CD34 phenotype, and the more mature CD34 depleted populations. A total of 6 differentially expressed complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) sequences were identified. Four of these transcripts were homologous to well characterised genes, while two (band 1 and band 20) were homologous to unknown and uncharacterised partial gene sequences on the GenBank database and were thus chosen for further investigation.
The partial cDNA sequences for band 1 and band 20 were designated ORP-3 and MERP-1 (respectively) due to homologies with other well-characterised gene families. Differential expression of the ORP-3 and MERP-1 genes was confirmed using Taqman&#8482; real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 3 - 4-fold and 4-10 -fold higher levels in the CD34+ fractions of haemopoietic cells compared to CD34- populations respectively. Additionally, expression of both these genes was down regulated with proliferation and differentiation of CD34+ cells further confirming higher expression in a less differentiated subset of haemopoietic cells.
 
The full coding sequences of ORP-3 and MERP-1 were elucidated using bioinformatics, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and PCR amplification. The MERP-1 cDNA is 2600 nucleotides (nt) long, and localizes by bioinformatics to chromosome 7.. It consists of three exons and 2 introns spanning an entire length of 31.4 kilobases (kb). The MERP-1 open reading frame (ORF) codes for a putative 344 amino acid (aa) type II transmembrane protein with an extracellular C-terminal ependymin like-domain and an intracellular N-terminal sequence with significant homology to the cytoplasmic domains of members of the protocadherin family of transmembrane glycoproteins. Ependymins and protocadherins are well-characterised calcium-dependant cell adhesion glycoproteins. Although the function of MERP-1 remains to be elucidated, it is possible that MERP-1 like its homologues plays a role in calcium dependent cell adhesion. Differential expression of the MERP-1 gene in haemopoietic cells suggests a role in haemopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, however, its broad tissue distribution implies that it may also play a role in many cell types. Characterization of the MERP-1 protein is required to elucidate these possible roles.
The ORP-3 cDNA is 6631nt long, and localizes by bioinformatics to chromosome 7pl5-p21. It consists of 23 exons and 22 introns spanning an entire length of 183.5kb. The ORP-3 ORF codes for a putative 887aa protein which displays the consensus sequence for a highly conserved oxysterol-binding domain. Other well-characterised proteins expressing these domains have been demonstrated to bind oxysterols (OS) in a dose dependant fashion. OS are hydroxylated derivatives of cholesterol Their biological activities include inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis and cell proliferation in a variety of cell types, including haemopoietic cells. Differential expression of the ORP-3 gene in haemopoietic cells suggests a possible role in the transduction of OS effects on haemopoietic cells, however, its broad tissue distribution implies that it may also play a role in many cell types.
 
Further investigation of ORP-3 gene expression demonstrates a significant correlation with CD34+ sample purity, and 2-fold higher expression in a population of haemopoietic cells defined by the CD34+38- phenotype compared to more mature CD34+38+ cells. This finding, taken together with the previous observation of down-regulation of ORP-3 expression with proliferation and differentiation of CD34+ cells, indicates that ORP-3 expression may be higher in a less differentiated subset of cells with a higher proliferative capacity. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that expression of the ORP-3 gene is approximately 2-fold lower in differentiated HL60 promyelocytic cells compared to control, undifferentiated cells.
ORP-3 expression in HL60 cells during normal culture conditions was also found to vary with expression positively correlated with cell number. This indicates a possible cell cycle effect on ORP-3 gene expression with levels highest when cell density, and therefore the percentage of cells in G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle is highest. This observation also correlates with the observation of higher ORP-3 expression in CD34+38-cells, and in CD34+ and HL60 cells undergoing OS induced and camptothecin induced apoptosis that is preceded by cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1). Expression of the ORP-3 gene in CD34+ HSPCs from UCB was significantly decreased to approximately half the levels observed in control cells after 24 hours incubation in transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF&#226;l). As &#8805;90% of these cells are stimulated into cell cycle entry by TGF&#226;l, this observation further supports the hypothesis that ORP-3 expression is highest when cells reside in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Data obtained from investigation of ORP-3 gene expression in synchronised HL60 cells however does not support nor disprove this hypothesis.
Culture of CD34+ enriched HSPCs and HL60 cells with 25-OHC significantly increased ORP-3 gene expression to approximately 1.5 times control levels. However, as 25-OHC treatment also increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in these experiments, it is not valid to make any conclusions regarding the regulation of ORP-3 gene expression by OS. Indeed, the observation that camptothecin induced apoptosis also increased ORP-3 gene expression in HL60 cells raises the possibility that up-regulation of ORP-3 gene expression is also associated with apoptosis,
Taken together, expression of the ORP-3 gene appears to be regulated by differentiation and apoptosis of haemopoietic progenitors, and may also be positively associated with proliferative and G(0)/G(1) cell cycle status indicating a possible role in all of these processes.
Given the important regulatory role of apoptosis in haemopoiesis and differential expression of the ORP-3 gene in haemopoietic progenitors, final investigations were conducted to examine the effects OS on human HSPCs. Granulocyte/macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM) generated from human bone marrow (ABM) and umbilical cord blood (UCB) were grown in the presence of varying concentrations of three different OS - 7keto-cholesterol (7K-C), 7beta-hydroxycholesterol (7p-OHC) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC). Similarly, the effect of OS on HL60 and CD34+ cells was investigated using annexin-V staining and flow cytometry to measure apoptosis. Reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) was used to assess differentiative status of HL60 cells. CFU-GM from ABM and HL60 growth was inhibited by all three OS tested, with 25-OHC being the most potent. 25-OHC inhibited &#8805;50% of bone marrow CFU-GM and &#8805;95% of HL60 cell growth at a level of 1 ug/ml. Compared to UCB, CFU-GM derived from ABM were more sensitive to the effects of all OS tested. Only 25-OHC and 7(5-OHC significantly inhibited growth of UCB derived CFU-GM. OS treatment increased the number of annexin-V CD34+ cells and NBT positive HL60 cells indicating that OS inhibition of CFU-GM and HL60 cell growth can be attributed to induction of apoptosis and differentiation.
From these studies, it can be concluded that dd-PCR is an excellent tool for the discovery of novel genes expressed in human HSPCs. Characterisation of the proteins encoded by the novel genes ORP-3 and MERP-1 may reveal a regulatory role for these genes in haemopoiesis. Finally, investigations into the effects of OS on haemopoietic progenitor cells has revealed that OS are a new class of inhibitors of HSPC proliferation of potential relevance in vivo and in vitro.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">identification of novel genes</field><field name="subject">haemopoietic progenitor cells</field><field name="subject">Taqman</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051111.113037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Lichen Flora of the Mount Donna Buang Scenic Reserve, Victoria.</field><field name="creator">Louwhoff, Simone Henrica J J</field><field name="description">This report investigated the lichen flora of the Mt Donna Buang Scenic Reserve in Victoria, There were several aims: to describe the lichens of the region, to produce a pictorial key enabling field identification and to determine any distribution patterns.
A floristic survey covering approximately 50 square km was undertaken to determine lichen diversity of the region generally. Lichens were sampled along roads, tracks, walking trails and in sections of bush, taking into account forest type and, particularly, areas that were lichen rich. Seventy-five lichen species in 43 genera and 27 families were identified and described from the region. An unknown, species H, also was described. Of the 76 lichen species, 22 were crastose and the remainder macrolichens.
The best represented families were: Cladoniaceae (8 species), Hypogymniaceae (6), Lobariaceae (7), Lecideaceae (6), Pannariaceae (6) and Parmeliaccae (6). This study described 12 species (17%) which previously were not known for Victoria and which are a first record for the state. These include: Cladonia sarmentosa (J.D. Hook &amp; Taylor) Dodge, Graphis librata Knight, Parmelinopsis neodamaziana (Elix &amp; Johnston) Elix &amp; Hale, Pertusaria novaezelandiae Szatala, Placopsis pardlina f. microphylla Lamb, Porina leptalea AX. Sm., Pseudocyphellaria ardesiaca Galloway, Trapeliopsis congregant (Zahlbr.) Brako, Menegazzia myriotrema (Mull. Arg.) P. James, Bunodophoron scrobiculatum (Church. Bab,) Wedin, Parmelia testacea Stirton and Menegazzia purpurascens S. Louwhoff sp. nov.. The last eight species are new to the mainland and, apart from Menegazzia purpurascens, previously were known only from Tasmania.
Five main elements of distribution were identified for the lichen flora of the Mt Donna Buang Scenic Reserve: cosmopolitan, austral/australasian, paleotropical, pantropical and western pacific. The majority of species (68%) had austral/australasian distributions, eleven (16%) were endemic to Australia and nine (13%) occurred only in Tasmania , Victoria and New Zealand.
A pictorial, dichotomous key was constructed for the lichen flora of the Mt Donna Buang Scenic Reserve. Previously, keys to the lichen flora of Tasmanian rainforests were suggested as appropriate to similar areas in Victoria, however, the Victorian forests include a significant sclerophyll element The key presented is specific for the study site but is appropriate to similar regions in Victoria and has been tested in a number of these areas.
 
The key was designed to be &#145;user-friendly&#146; so that the experienced and inexperienced alike are able to use it.
A more detailed investigation of the lichen flora of the Mt Donna Buang Scenic Reserve was carried out in order to determine distribution. A total of 50 quadrats, each 20m x 20m in size, were sampled. Within each, the dominant vegetation type was determined and individuals were identified and location noted. The cover abundance of each lichen species on each individual tree was estimated using a modified Braun-Blanquet scale. A total of 710 trees, representing 13 different species, were examined. Nothofagus cunninghamii (Hook.) Oerst, Eucalyptus regnans R Mull., Acacia dealbata Link, A. melanoxylon R. Br., Hedycarya angustifolia A. Cunn. and Atherosperma moschatum Labill. were the six most common tree species encountered at the study site. Nothofagus cunninghamii supported the greatest lichen diversity (39 species), although most species occurred on less than 10% of the trees. The majority of lichens occurring on N. cunninghamii A. melanoxylon, A. dealbata and H. angustifolia were foliose or crustose, those on &#163;. regnans fruticose and foliose and those on A moschatum crustose.
Bunodophoron australe was the only lichen species at the study site to occur on one host, Nothofagus cunninghamiL Many occurred on a number of different hosts, but were most common on one particular tree species.
The distribution of lichens at the study site was analysed with a rnultivariate statistical package (PATN) which dealt with &#145;pattern analysis&#146;. The program &#145;SSH&#146; in PATN which uses the Bray-Curtis ordination technique, was used to create scatterplots displaying the degree of dissimilarity between quadrats in terms of presence/absence of lichen species. The program &#145;TWAY&#146; in PATN was used to construct a two way table to display which lichen species occurred in each vegetation type.
The pattern analysis revealed that the lichens of the Mt Donna Buang Scenic Reserve were not restricted to any particular forest type, but particular lichens, or groups of lichens, tended to predominate in certain vegetation communities. This concurs with work done by others in Tasmanian forests.
Quadrats which were situated in cool temperate rainforest were grouped more closely with each other than with quadrats in other vegetation types. These also supported the greatest number of lichen species. This was not surprising since N. cunninghamii the dominant tree species in cool temperate rainforest, supported the greatest lichen diversity.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lichens</field><field name="subject">Mount Donna Buang</field><field name="subject">Mount Donna Buang Scenic Reserve</field><field name="subject">Plants</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051111.114644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploratory surgery of the female psyche.</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Sharni</field><field name="description">The thesis explores the visual narrative concerning a journey of empowerment for women. To enable the journey to advance the inquiry is directed into two areas. The first area is female gender, which is argued to be socially constructed and implicit in the marginalisation of women in western society. The second area is &#145;feminine authority&#146;, which is gained by developing an understanding and acceptance of the characteristics which have historically been considered as belonging to the feminine. Granting these characteristics agency would recognise their authority and assist in the elevation of the female to a position of equality in western society.
Beginning from a feminist position, the research supported the belief that the female is marginalised in western society. It also confirmed the notion that empowerment and authority can be attained by women if they actively pursue the following;
&#149;  Explore their own psychology beyond the existing socially constructed gender roles.
&#149;  Develop an understanding of their feminine self by applying Jung's theories on individuation and archetypes.
&#149;  Expose the underlying patriarchal influence in western epistemology and science by challenging existing deeply held cultural and scientific beliefs and by actively contributing as feminists to the areas of epistemology and science.
Archetypal myths of the &#145;feminine&#146; have developed from an androcentric position. They enforce and perpetuate gender imbalance which contributes to the disenfranchisement of women in western society, &#145;Individuation&#146; is a process in which a person explores aspects of themselves to bring forth parts of their unconscious into their conscious mind in an attempt to gain a deeper understanding of themselves. As a consequence the consciousness develops closer links with archetypal memories which assists the exploration. The &#145;true feminine&#146; is the feminine not restricted or defined by the dominant androcentric view. Knowledge of the feminine empowers women to address the marginalisation of the female in western society and assists in the process of gaining female authority.
This enquiry also investigated the four stages of female psychological development with regard to patriarchal influences. Of particular importance is the second stage of psychological development where the female identifies with historically perceived inferior characteristics of the female. This is when she rejects her connections with the primacy of female power and her deep connections with nature which were inherited from archaic times. It is at this stage that she absorbs the myths associated with western patriarchal society which effectively disempower her.
 
Western epistemology, with its emphasis on &#145;objective&#146; investigation and empiricism contributes to the support for and promotion of &#145;inferior&#146; female gender. This type of investigation is brought into question when areas of research into primates and human evolutionary theory is shown to develop from an androcentric view.
Western knowledge has associations with power and justice and power is commonly associated with dominance. Regard for &#145;truth&#146; and &#145;absolute&#146; can be viewed as key elements in the support for knowledge and its associations with power. Knowledge has historically maintained suppression of individual experience which promotes a universalised account. This suppression of beliefs other than the dominant authority maintains the existing dominant social structure.
Foucault's view of the genderised or inscribed body alerts us to areas where dominance, resistance and power play a part in maximising masculine power and control. Gender becomes an instrument of power within the existing patriarchal structure. Gender, knowledge and power are identified as areas obstructing female empowerment.
Part 3 of this exegesis examines the imagery which embodies the visual narrative. Particularly, the harlequin image, its historical background and connections with ancient mythology including reference to Jungian psychology. The harlequin image is developed sequentially in the earlier black and white drawings on paper. These drawings contained a female figure which was often placed in juxtaposition with a Venus or goddess image, reference was also made to &#145;eve&#146; and the &#145;siren&#146;. These elements provided the framework which enabled the harlequin image to emerge and evolve. The narrative developed with an understanding of the &#145;feminine&#146; aspects of the psyche which resulted in the harlequin acquiring the elevated authority of a goddess.
The Harlequin evolved from my need for symbolic representation of the female psyche. It represents contradiction and dualism. It is a composition of opposites, reflects masculine and feminine traits, the dark and light of the conscious and unconscious mind, it houses both comic and sinister elements, is a trickster and menace. The costume, colours and patterns are expressive elements conducive to fragmentation and layering within the composition of the paintings.
Jung examined the harlequin in Picasso's paintings. He concluded that as Picasso drew on his inner experiences the harlequin became important as a symbol; it was a pictorial representation from the unconscious psyche. It travelled freely from the conscious to the unconscious and represented the masculine and feminine, chthonian and apollonian.
The final painting in the series, a triptych, completes the narrative and stands alone as a salutatory work. It unites the series by combining existing compositional devices
 
and technique while making reference to imagery from previous works, &#145;The Three Graces Victorious&#146;, expresses the authority of the feminine. It completes a victorious stage of a journey where the harlequin is empowered by archaic memories and knowledge of the psyche. The feminine is hailed, elevated and venerated.
Other elements which assist in expressing the visual narrative are; colour, technique and influence. Colour is explored and its use as an emotive devise in expressionism. Paul Klee's writing on the use of colour and it's symbolic meaning and Julia Kristeva's investigation on colour from a psychoanalytic and semiotic view are also discussed.
To indicate influences and connections within my oeuvre, reference is also made to the following: Jasper Johns' for his use of imagery in his &#145;Four Seasons&#146; series with it's reference to a journey of maturation and Louise Bourgeois' work which deals with issues of gender, memories and past journeys.
Although &#145;The Three Graces Victorious&#146;; the concluding painting for the investigation is celebratory and represents a finality to the thesis, it points to further areas that impede feminine development and need future examination. Reference is made to a continuation of the exploratory journey by plotting the Harlequin/Goddesses future directions. Although the Harlequin/Goddess is empowered with newly acquired authority, her future journey does not need to be bound by mathematics or limited by rationality. She does not require power to dominate or gender structures to subjugate, but requires limitless boundaries and contexts. The Harlequin/Goddess's future journey is not fixed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminism in art</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051111.115947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting success in undergraduate computer programming.</field><field name="creator">Goold, Annegret</field><field name="description">The aim of the research is to investigate factors that may explain success in elementary computer programming at the tertiary level.
The first phase of the research included the identification of possible explanatory factors through a literature review, a survey of students studying introductory computing, a focus-group session with teachers of computer programming and interviews with programming students.
The second phase of the research that was called the main study, involved testing the identified factors. Two different groups of programming students - one group majoring in business computing and another majoring in computer science - completed a survey questionnaire.
The findings of the research are as follows.
Gender is of little significance for business students but there is an adverse gender penalty for females in computer science. Secondary school assessment is inversely related to outcomes in business computing but directly influences outcomes in the first programming unit in the computer science course. As in prior research, previous knowledge and experience were demonstrated to matter, A range of other variables was found to be of little importance. The research suggests that different problem-solving techniques might be relevant in business compared with those of use in computer science.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer programming</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">victoria</field><field name="subject">teriary level computer programming</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051111.120545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Phytophthora Cinnamomi on heathland flora and fauna of the Eastern Otway Ranges.</field><field name="creator">Laidlaw, William Scott</field><field name="description">The plant pathogen, Phytophthora dnnamomi, is a cause of dieback disease observed in sclerophyll vegetation in Australia, The effects of P. dnnamomi on flora and fauna were studied at two locations in heathland vegetation near the coastal town of Anglesea, Victoria. The pathogen was isolated from soils beneath diseased heathland plants. The extent of diseased vegetation was assessed by the presence and absence of highly sensitive indicator species, Xanthorrhoea australis and hopogon ceratophyllus. The characteristics of heathland vegetation exhibiting dieback disease associated with the presence of P.  dnnamomi were investigated.
Plant species richness was similar between diseased and non-diseased areas however diseased areas were characterised by significant declines in the cover and frequency of susceptible species, increases in resistant species and increases in percent cover of open ground. Compared to non-diseased areas, diseased areas exhibited fewer shrub species and decreased shrub cover. The percentage cover and number of species of sedges, lilies and grasses were higher in diseased areas. Structural differences were significant between 0-0.6 m with decreased cover of vegetation in diseased areas. Differences in structure between diseased and non-diseased areas were not as great as expected due to increases in the cover of resistant species. A number of regenerating X australis were observed in post-disease areas. Cluster analysis of floristic data could clearly separate diseased and non-diseased trap stations.
The population dynamics and habitat use of eight small mammal species present were compared in diseased and non-diseased areas using trapping and radio-tracking techniques. The number of small mammal species captured in post-disease areas was significantly lower than non-diseased areas. Mean captures of Antechinus stuartii and Rattus fiisdpes were significantly lower in diseased areas on Grid B. Mean captures of Rattus lutreolus were significantly lower in diseased areas on both study grids. Significant differences were not observed in every season over the two year study period. Radio tracking revealed more observations of Sminthopsis leucopus in non-diseased vegetation than in diseased. Cercartetus nanus was frequently observed to utilise the disease susceptible X. australis for nesting.
At one location, the recovery of vegetation and small mammal communities in non-diseased and diseased vegetation after fuel reduction burning was monitored for three years post-fire. Return of plant species after fire in both disease classes were similar, reaching 75% of pre-fire richness after three years. Vegetation cover was slower to return after fire in diseased areas. Of the seven small mammal species captured pre-fire, five were regularly captured in the three years after fire. General linear model analysis revealed a significant influence of disease on capture rates for total small mammals before fire and a significant influence of fire on capture rates for total small mammals after fire. After three years, the influence of fire on capture rates was reduced no significant difference was detected between disease classes. Measurements of microclimate indicate that diseased, burnt heathland was likely to experience greater extremes of temperature and wind speed. Seeding of diseased heathland with X. australis resulted in the establishment of seedlings of this sensitive species.
The reported distributions of the mamma] species in Victoria were analysed to determine which species were associated with the reported distribution of dieback disease. Twenty-two species have more than 20% of their known distribution in diseased areas. Five of these species, Pseudomys novaehollandiae, Pseudomys fumeust Pseudomys shortridgei, Potorous longipes and Petrogale pencillata are rare or endangered in Victoria. Four of the twenty-two species, Sminthopsis leucopus, Isoodon obesulus, Cercartetus nanus and Rottus lutreolus am observed in Victorian heathlands.
Phytophthora cinnamomi changes both the structure and floristics of heathland vegetation in the eastern Qtway Ranges. Small mammals respond to these changes through decreased utilisation of diseased heathland. The pathogen threatens the diversity of species present and future research efforts should be directed towards limiting its spread and rehabilitating diseased areas.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phytophtora cinnamomi</field><field name="subject">Anglesea</field><field name="subject">otway ranges</field><field name="subject">heathlands</field><field name="subject">pathogenic microorganisms</field><field name="subject">dieback</field><field name="subject">antechinus</field><field name="subject">mammals</field><field name="subject">moor ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051111.121612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Succession of small mammal communities after fire and reintroduction of the Swamp Antechinus Antechinue Minimus.</field><field name="creator">Aberton, John G</field><field name="description">This thesis is involved with changes that have occurred to small mammal populations following a major disturbance in the Anglesea region as a result of the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires. Fire, with its effects on spatial and temporal heterogeneity, was found to be an important factor in the maintenance of vegetation and small mammal community structure and diversity in the region. Successional changes in vegetation and small mammal communities were described by multivariate analyses, using data collected annually from 22 study sites. The use of factor analysis techniques, in reducing the annual capture data content, enabled long-term changes in the structure of mammal communities to be interpreted. The small mammal communities in the coastal heath and forest vegetation in the Anglesea region show evidence of a general resilience, (the degree and speed of recovery), to disturbance. Two phases of successional response to fire by mammal species have been proposed; a &#145;re-establishment&#146; phase which occurs in the initial 5-6 years post-fire and is accompanied by rapid increase in species&#146; abundance, and a subsequent &#145;maintenance&#146; phase accompanied by relatively minor changes in abundance. Habitat Suitability Indices were produced relating to these phases. Vertical density measures of understorey shrubs and herb layers showed significant relationships with small mammal species abundance at the study sites. Long term studies following major disturbances are needed to distinguish between short term recovery of plant and animal species and long term changes in these species. Studies extending over a number of years enable a better directional view of changes in small mammal communities than can be determined from . observations made over a short period.
As a part of the investigation into temporal change, it was proposed to undertake trial reintroductions of the Swamp antechinus, Ant echinus minimus, a marsupial dasyurid species which was trapped in the area prior to the 1983 fire, but rarely subsequently. Other more commonly observed native small mammal species (e.g. Rattus fuscipes,R. lutreolus, Antechinus stuartii, Sminthopsis leucopus) had re-invaded the proposed reintroduction site after this fire. Failure of A. minimus to re-establish may have been due to spatial separation of the pre-fire populations coupled with the extensive area burnt in 1983, A source population of the species was located about 100km to the west and habitat utilization and interspecific and niche relationships between the species making the small mammal community explored. Discriminant analysis revealed some spatial separation of species within a habitat based on structural vegetation factors rather than floristic factors. Temporal separation of species was observed, asA. minimus were more active than Rattus species during daylight periods. There was evidence of micro-habitat selection by species, and structural vegetation factors were most commonly identified in statistical analyses as contributing towards selection by small mammal species. Following a theoretical modelling study three reintroduction trials were carried out near Anglesea during 1992-94. Individuals were subsequently radio tracked, and habitat relationships between the species in the small mammal community investigated. Although successful breeding of A, minimus occurred during the latter two trials, the subsequent fate of offspring was not determined. Invasive techniques required to adequately monitor young animals were considered potentially too damaging. Telemetry studies indicated a preference of A. minimus for short, wet heath vegetation. Structural vegetation factors were identified as being significant in discriminating between capture locations of species. Small scale and inexpensive trial reintroductions have yielded valuable additional data on this species and may be viewed as a useful tool in the conservation of other small native mammals.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antechinus minimus</field><field name="subject">Otway Region</field><field name="subject">marsupials</field><field name="subject">wildlife conservation</field><field name="subject">ecological succession</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051111.122639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of vegetation, fire and other disturbance factors on small mammal, ecology and conservation.</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Barbara Anne</field><field name="description">The relationship of vegetation and disturbance factors to the distribution, abundance and diversity of small mammals in the eastern Otway region, Victoria were investigated. Antechinus stuartii, Rattus fuscipes and Rattus lutreolus were widely distributed and occurred in the majority of the eleven floristic vegetation groups identified. 
Antechinus minimus, Antechinus swainsonnii and Pseudomys novaehollandiae had restricted distributions and were recorded in only two or three vegetation groups. New information on the distribution of the rare species P. novaehollandiae, was obtained and two floristically rich vegetation groups that it preferred were identified.
Species-rich small mammal communities occurred in vegetation communities with high numbers of sclerophyll plant species and high structural diversity. Maximum food resources were considered to be provided in these communities. Local habitat diversity was also correlated with species-richness. Small mammal abundance was maximum in non-sclerophyllous canmunities, where high plant productivity was considered to be important.
For the first time, the presence of the plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi was shown to affect small mammals. It was associated with small mammal communities of low species richness and abundance,
Recovery of small mammal populations after wildfire was slow until the fourth year. Mus musculus reached peak abundance from 2-3 years and then declined rapidly. P.  novaehollandiae was the only native species that achieved maximum abundance early in the succession. A. stuartii, R. fuscipes and R. lutreolus approached maximum abundance in mid-succession, while Isoodon obesulus was a mid- to late-successional species. A. minimus survived the fire, but did not persist after one year. The pattern of succession was influenced by attributes of species, such as survival after fire, their ability to disperse and reproduce.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mammals</field><field name="subject">victoria</field><field name="subject">otway ranges</field><field name="subject">fire ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">small mammals</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051111.135542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Programmer friendly and efficient distributed shared memory integrated into a distributed operating system.</field><field name="creator">Silcock, Jackie</field><field name="description">Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) provides programmers with a shared memory environment in systems where memory is not physically shared.  Clusters of Workstations (COWs), an often untapped source of computing power, are characterised by a very low cost/performance ratio.  The combination of Clusters of Workstations (COWs) with DSM provides an environment in which the programmer can use the well known approaches and methods of programming for physically shared memory systems and parallel processing can be carried out to make full use of the computing power and cost advantages of the COW.

The aim of this research is to synthesise and develop a distributed shared memory system as an integral part of an operating system in order to provide application programmers with a convenient environment in which the development and execution of parallel applications can be done easily and efficiently, and which does this in a transparent manner.  Furthermore, in order to satisfy our challenging design requirements we want to demonstrate that the operating system into which the DSM system is integrated should be a distributed operating system.

In this thesis a study into the synthesis of a DSM system within a microkernel and client-server based distributed operating system which uses both strict and weak consistency models, with a write-invalidate and write-update based approach for consistency maintenance is reported.  Furthermore a unique automatic initialisation system which allows the programmer to start the parallel execution of a group of processes with a single library call is reported.  The number and location of these processes are determined by the operating system based on system load information.

The DSM system proposed has a novel approach in that it provides programmers with a complete programming environment in which they are easily able to develop and run their code or indeed run existing shared memory code.  A set of demanding DSM system design requirements are presented and the incentives for the placement of the DSM system with a distributed operating system and in particular in the memory management server have been reported.  The new DSM system concentrated on an event-driven set of cooperating and distributed entities, and a detailed description of the events and reactions to these events that make up the operation of the DSM system is then presented.  This is followed by a pseudocode form of the detailed design of the main modules and activities of the primitives used in the proposed DSM system.

Quantitative results of performance tests and qualitative results showing the ease of programming and use of the RHODOS DSM system are reported.  A study of five different application is given and the results of tests carried out on these applications together with a discussion of the results are given.  A discussion of how RHODOS&#146; DSM allows programmers to write shared memory code in an easy to use and familiar environment and a comparative evaluation of RHODOS DSM with other DSM systems is presented.  In particular, the ease of use and transparency of the DSM system have been demonstrated through the description of the ease with which a moderately inexperienced undergraduate programmer was able to convert, write and run applications for the testing of the DSM system.  Furthermore, the description of the tests performed using physically shared memory shows that the latter is indistinguishable from distributed shared memory; this is further evidence that the DSM system is fully transparent.  This study clearly demonstrates that the aim of the research has been achieved; it is possible to develop a programmer friendly and efficient DSM system fully integrated within a distributed operating system.

It is clear from this research that client-server and microkernel based distributed operating system integrated DSM makes shared memory operations transparent and almost completely removes the involvement of the programmer beyond classical activities needed to deal with shared memory.  The conclusion can be drawn that DSM, when implemented within a client-server and microkernel based distributed operating system, is one of the most encouraging approaches to parallel processing since it guarantees performance improvements with minimal programmer involvement.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">distributed operating systems</field><field name="subject">electronic data processing</field><field name="subject">memory management</field><field name="subject">RHODOS</field><field name="subject">COWs</field><field name="subject">computer science</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051114.110240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">El tr&#225;nsito desde la higiene hacia la salud la p&#250;blica en Colombia en el contexto de las interacciones internactionales.</field><field name="creator">Quevedo, Emilio</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public health in Colombia</field><field name="subject">colombia</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051118.110705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women clinical nurses' constructions of collegiality: An ethnomethodological study.</field><field name="creator">Cash, Penelope Anne</field><field name="description">This research is about a shared journey of being together. It involved thirteen women nurses (including myself) in a process approach to working with data collected through audio transcriptions of conversations during group get-togethers, field notes and journalling over twelve months. The project was conducted in a large acute care metropolitan hospital where the ward staff interests lie in a practice history of the medical specialty of gynaecology and women's health.
Prior to commencement ethical approval was gained from both the University and hospital ethics committees. Accessing the group was complicated by the political climate of the hospital, possibly exaggerated further by the health politics across the state of Victoria, at a time of major upheaval characterised by regionalism, rationalisation and debt servicing.
In order to ascertain women clinical nurses' constructions of collegiality I adopted an ethnomethodological approach informed by a critical feminist lens to enable the participants to engage in a process of openly ideological inquiry, in critiquing and transforming practice. I felt the choice of methodology had to be consistent with my own ideological position to enable me to be myself (as much as I could) during the project. I wanted to work with women to illuminate the ways in which dominant ideologies had come to be apprehended, inscribed, embodied and/or resisted in the everyday intersubjective realities of participants. The research itself became a site of resistance as the group became aware of how and in what ways their lives had become distorted, while at the same time it collaboratively transformed their individual and collective practice understandings, enabling them to see the self and other anew.
Set against the background of dominant discourses on collegiality, women's understandings of collegiality have remained a submerged discourse. Revealed in this work are complex inter-relationships that might be described by some as collegial!, but for others relations amongst these women depict alternative meanings in a rich picture of the fabric of ward life. The participants understand these relations through a connectedness that has empathy as its starting point.
In keeping with my commitment to engage with these women I endeavoured to remain faithful to the dialogical approach to this inquiry. Moreover I have brought the voices of the women to the foreground, peeling away the rhizomatic interconnections in and between understandings. What this has meant in terms of the thesis is that the work has become artificially distanced for the purposes of academic requirements. Nevertheless it speaks to the understandings the participants have of their relationships; of the various locations of the visible and invisible voices; of the many landscapes and images, genealogies, subjectivities and multiple selves that inform the selves with(in) others and being-in-relation. Throughout the journey meanings are revealed, revisited and reconstructed. Many nuances comprise the subtexts illuminating the depths of various moral locations underpinning the ways these women engage with one another in practice. The process of the research weaves through multiple positions, conveying the centrality of shared goals, multiple identities, resistances and differences which contribute to a holding environment, a location in which women value one another in their being-in-relation and in which they stand separately yet together.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">clinical nurses</field><field name="subject">ethnomethodological study</field><field name="subject">philosopy</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051123.122031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the extended family on microenterprise growth in Ghana: A case study of Accra.</field><field name="creator">Quaye, Daniel M</field><field name="description">This study examines the extended family's impact on microenterprise growth at the individual level, where microenterprise operators have some control over constraints affecting their operations. Beyond the individual level, microenterprise operators have little control over constraints such as government policies and regulations, competition from import-substitution industries and exploitation by corrupt officials. Therefore, it is at the individual level that the extended family serves as a crucial parameter of microenterprise growth and the success with which MEs graduate from the informal sector into the mainstreams of small business. Within this domain, this author has examined the extended family and found that there is a need for policy makers and MED administrators to adopt a more culturally sensitive approach to microenterprise growth if the extended family is to be engaged as a partner in their efforts to support microenterprises as a source of income and employment generation,
A central question posed is why most writers on microenterprise activities in Ghana have neglected the extended family as a factor that should be considered in the design of microenterprise growth strategies and policies? The answer to this question was explored in the process of data gathering for this thesis and the results are presented here, especially in chapter 3 below. Suffice it to note here that this neglect has many roots, not least of which is the proclivity of mainstream economics, modern administration practice and the objectivity of double entry accounting based documentation procedures to focus on measurable growth in the formal sectors of the economy and structural constraints such as the lack of finance, lack of market demand, lack of access to technology and government regulations. Consequently, a noticeable trend among these writers is that they rightly advocate finance be made accessible to microenterprises, however, few question whether the finance is effectively used towards microenterprise growth. This issue is crucial in the face of evidence from this study which shows that finance accessed towards microenterprise growth is often put to other uses that negate growth thus keeping microenterprises within the bounds of the informal sector as against graduating out of the informal sector. As a result, these writers have neglected the intimate relations between the extended family and microenterprises, and most importantly, the constraint that the extended family inflicts on microenterprise growth at the individual level of activity. This study, by targeting the growth of the individual microenterprise in the socio-cultural context in which this growth must be achieved, has highlighted the constraint that the extended family does pose on MED. However, the study also shows that these constraints are important not because there is anything inherently wrong with the extended family, but because the socio-economic and policy environment is not consistent with the positive role that the extended family can and should play in the graduation of microenterprises from the informal to the formal sector of the economy in Ghana.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ghana</field><field name="subject">small business in Ghana</field><field name="subject">Accra</field><field name="subject">economic growth</field><field name="subject">microenterprise growth</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051123.122956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alterations in renal and myocardial adrenoceptors associated with ethynyloestradiol- and levonorgestrel-induced hypertension in the rat.</field><field name="creator">Geraghty, Dominic P</field><field name="description">Hypertension is one of many side effects of oral contraceptive use in a small percentage of women. Although the underlying pathology has yet to be fully resolved, alterations in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, sympathetic nervous system/ renal and cardiac function have been implicated. In the thesis to be presented, the possible involvement of alterations in renal and myocardial adrenoceptor characteristics in the pathogenesis of steroid contraceptive-induced hypertension in rats was examined by radioligand binding techniques.
In Chapter 2, a rat model of OC hypertension is described. Chronic low-dose administration of ethynyloestradiol (EE2),
levonorgestrel (NG) or a combination of both steroids (EE2/NG) to female Sprague-Dawley rats was shown to significantly increase systolic blood pressure (SBP). Renal and cardiac hypertrophy developed in association with EE2-, EE2/NG- but not NG-induced hypertension. Moreover, whereas administration of NG alone attenuated body weight gain, combined EE2/NG administration increased body weight gain from the second week of treatment onwards. Based on the above observations, it is proposed that EE2 and NG induce hypertension in rats via different mechanisms.
Although SBP was elevated to a similar maximum in all steroid-treated groups (+ 20 mmHg compared to controls), only with EE2 administration did SBP remain elevated for the duration of the 17 week treatment regimen. NG may therefore have a protective effect on blood pressure with long-term combined steroid contraceptive treatment.
In Chapter 4, renal adrenoceptors were characterized using radioactively labelled adrenocephor antagonists. Under appropriate 
conditions, binding of [3H]-prazosin and [3H]-rauwolscine to membrane
preparations of whole rat kidney displayed the kinetics, saturability
and specificity of &#945;1- and &#945;2 -adrenoceptors respectively, which were present in a ratio 3:1. In contrast, [3H]-dihydroergocryptine ([3H]-DHE) apparently bound to both &#945;1 and &#945;2-adrenoceptors.  Binding sites identified by [125I] &#150;iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) had the
recognition characteristics of &#946;-adrenoceptors.  In drug competition studies using the subtype-selective antagonists practolol (&#946;1) and ICI 118,551 (&#946;2)/ the ratio of &#946;1- to &#946;2 -adrenoceptors was found to be approximately 2:1.
Subsequently, renal adrenoceptors were investigated at various stages during the development of hypertension with the different steroid contraceptive treatments (Chapters 5 and 6). Preliminary binding studies with [3H]-DHE and [3H]-prazosin suggested that the number of renal &#945;2 - but not &#945;1-adrenoceptors was reduced in rats with established EE2-induced hypertension (17 weeks treatment). This was subsequently confirmed using [3H]-rauwolscine, which in addition showed that the reduction in renal &#945;2 -adrenoceptor number occurred during the developmental stage of EE2/NG~induced hypertension (6 weeks treatment) and established EE2-induced hypertension (12 weeks treatment).  NG induced hypertension was unassociated with changes in renal &#945;1- and &#945;2-adrenoceptor characteristics. Renal &#946;-adrenoceptor affinity was reduced in established EE2-, but not NG- or EE2/NG- induced hypertension. Moreover, the &#946;-adrenoceptor agonist (-)-isoprenaline bound to renal &#946;-adrenoceptors with reduced affinity following EE2 administration.
Several endogenous and synthetic steroids were found to be ineffective inhibitors of [3H] &#150;prazosin, [3H] &#150;rauwolscine and ICYP binding excluding a direct interaction of these steroids with renal &#945;1-, &#945;2- and &#946; -adrenoceptors.



In Chapter 7, myocardial adrenoceptors were characterized and
investigated in steroid-treated rats. In membrane preparations of whole myocardium, [3H]-prazosin binding was characteristically to &#945;1-
adrenoceptors, whereas there was a notable absence of [3H]-rauwolscine 
binding. Using ICYP, &#946;-adrenoceptors were also detected, the ratio of &#946;1- to &#946;2~adrenoceptors being 3:1. Steroid contraceptive-induced hypertension was not associated with myocardial &#945;1-adrenoceptor changes.  Similarly, myocardial &#946;-adrenoceptors were unchanged in established EE2-, NG- and EE2/NG-induced hypertension (12 weeks treatment). The affinity of (-)-isoprenaline for myocardial &#946;-adrenoceptors was unaffected by EE2 aditiinistration.
These studies suggest that established EE2- but not NG-induced hypertension in rats is associated with selective alterations in renal &#945;2- and (&#946;-adrenoceptors.  These adrenoceptor changes may help to maintain elevated blood pressure by affecting the control of renal function by the sympathetic nervous system, catecholamines and several hormones which affect renin release and the transport of fluid and electrolytes in the nephron.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">contraceptives</field><field name="subject">hypertension</field><field name="subject">renal systems</field><field name="subject">cardiac</field><field name="subject">hypretension</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051123.133239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Islamisation of Bosnia:  Early Islamic influence on Bosnian society.</field><field name="creator">Haveric, Dzavid</field><field name="description">This Masters thesis examines the process of the Islamisation of Bosnia from the eighth century to the end of the fifteenth century. This era of early Islamic influence has not previously been systematically studied, and remains an area little understood by many medievalists. The major foci of the analysis are the pre-Ottoman era and early Ottoman periods. This thesis raises the following research questions: When and how did the first Islamisation of the Balkan Slavs (including Bosnians) occur? How did Islam influence Bosnian society and culture, and where were the Bosnian Muslim settlements established?
This thesis includes a detailed historical investigation that makes use of a range of bibliographic materials. These consist of fragmentary works, archival and administrative documents and other relevant factography collected from a research field trip to Bosnia between June 27 and July 24, 2003.
The main findings reveal the complexity of this culturo-religious process in terms of both the early Islamic influence and contemporary cultural diversity.

The reaction of polymeric diorganotin oxides, (R2SnO)m (R = Me, Et, n-Bu, n-Oct, c-Hex, i-Pr, Ph), with saturated aqueous NH4X solutions (X = F, Cl, Br, I, OAc) in refluxing 1,4-dioxane afforded in high yields dimeric tetraorganodistannoxanes, [R2(X)SnOSn(X)R2]2, and in a few cases diorganotin dihalides or diacetates, R2SnX2. This method appears to be particularly good for the synthesis of halogenated tetraorganodistannoxanes but a less suitable method for the preparation of dicarboxylato tetraorganodistannoxanes. Identification of [R2(OH)SnOSn(X)R2]2 (R = n-Bu; X = Cl, Br) and [R2(OH)SnOSn(X)R2][R2(X)SnOSn(X)R2] suggest a serial substitution mechanism starting from [R2(OH)SnOSn(OH)R2]2.
A series of &#945;, &#969; -bis(triphenylstannyl)alkanes, [Ph3Sn]2(CH2)n (n = 3-8, 10, 12) and some of their derivatives were synthesised and characterised. These &#945;, &#969;-bis(triphenylstannyl)alkanes, [Ph3Sn]2(CH2)n were converted to the corresponding halides [R(Cl)2Sn]2(CH2)n (R = CH2SiMe3) and subsequently to the polymeric oxides {[R(0)Sn]2(CH2)n}m. Reaction of {[R(O)Sn]2(CH2)n}m with [R(Cl)2Sn]2(CH2)n. (n = 3, n' = 4 and n = 4, n' = 3) in toluene at 100&#176;C results in a mixture of symmetric and asymmetric double ladders, where different spacer chain lengths (n and n') provide the source of asymmetry. The coexistence at high temperature of separate 119Sn NMR signals belonging to symmetric and asymmetric double ladders suggests an equilibrium that is slow on the 119Sn NMR time scale and the position of which is temperature dependent. However, 119Sn NMR spectroscopic experiments of {[R(0)Sn]2(CH2)3}m with [R(Cl)2Sn]2(CH2)n for longer spacers (n - 5, 6, 8, 10, 12) reveal that molecular self-assembly of symmetric spacer-bridged di-tin precursors of equal chain length is preferred over asymmetric species.
An ether-bridged di-tin tetrachloride [R(Cl)2Sn(CH2)3]2O (R = CH2SiMe3) and its corresponding polymeric oxide {[R(O)Sn(CH2)3]2O}m were synthesised and characterised. Reaction of [R(Cl)2Sn(CH2)3]2O with {[R(O)Sn(CH2)3]2O}m results in a unique functionalised double ladder {{[RSn(Cl)](CH2)3O(CH2)3[RSn(Cl)]}O}4 whose structure in the solid state was determined by X-ray analysis. Identification of tetrameric functionalised double ladder as well as dimeric and monomeric species suggest the existence of an equilibrium in solution. The feasibility of the functionalised double ladder to form host-guest complexes with a variety of metal cations is investigated using electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS). Evidence for such complexes is found only for sodium cations.
The reaction between {[R(O)Sn]2(CH2)n}m (n = 3, 4, 8, 10) and triflic acid is described. The initial formed products [RSn(CH2)nSnR](OTf)4 are easily hydrolysed. For n = 3, self-assembly leads to a discrete double ladder type structure, {{[RSn(OH)](CH2)3[RSn(H2O)]}O}44OTf, which is the first example of a cationic double ladder. For n &#8805; 3, hydrolysis gives polymeric products, as demonstrated by the crystal structure of {[(H2O)(OH)RSn]2(CH2)4-2OTf2H2O}m.
Two spacer-bridged terra-tin octachlorides [R(Cl)2Sn(CH2)3Sn(Cl)2]2(CH2)n (R = CH2SiMes; n = 1, 8) and their corresponding polymeric oxides {[R(O)Sn(CH2)3Sn(O)]2(CH2)n}m were successfully synthesised and characterised. Attempts were made to synthesise quadruple ladders from these precursors. Reactions of [R(Cl)2Sn(CH2)3Sn(Cl)2]2CH2 with {[R(O)Sn(CH2)3Sn(O)]2CH2}m or (Y-Bu2SnO)3 result in, mostly insoluble, amorphous solids. Reactions of [R(Cl)2Sn(CH2)3Sn(Cl)2]2(CH2)8 with {[R(O)Sn(CH2)3Sn(O)]2(CH2)8}m or (t-Bu2SnO)s result in new tin-containing species which are presumably oligomeric.
The synthesis of a series of alkyl-bridged di-tin hexacarboxylates [(RCO2)3Sn]2(CH2)n (n = 3, 4; R = Ph, c-C6H11, CH3, C1CH2) is also reported. The hydrolysis of these compounds is facile and complex. There appears to be no correlation between spacer chain length and hydrolysis product. However, the conjugate acid strength of the carboxylate does appear to be important. In general only insoluble amorphous polymeric organotin-oxo compounds were obtained.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organotin compounds</field><field name="subject">organotin-oxo clusters</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.084244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the production of viscous capsular material by the yoghurt starter, Streptococcus thermophilus</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Darren P</field><field name="description">The technology of modern fermented milk production is not complicated and relies largely on the characteristics of the microorganisms used in its manufacture. Biochemical substances excreted by the starter cultures contribute to the chemical, physical and organoleptic properties of cultured milks. Chemical and organoleptic properties of yoghurt starter cultures have been widely studied over several decades. Conversely the biosynthetic processes and genetic control of the production of viscous extracellular material (slime) by selected thermophillic streptococci is still insufficiently understood. This study attempted to elucidate physiological aspects and the genetic control of slime production. An attempt to chemically induce ropiness was also preformed.
Twenty strains of Gram positive, thermo-tolerant, milk dotting, catalase negative cocci were collected from a variety of sources. All strains were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus. Four of the isolates were identified as capable of producing an extracellular, &#145;ropy&#146; capsular material.
A negative staining method for highlighting capsular material under light microscopy was described. Ropy isolates displayed thick capsular zones of between 6-8 &#956;m. The isolates graded as non-ropy produced only small capsular zones (less than 2 &#956;m); two variants displayed no capsular material.
Instability of the ropy phenotype during subculture and prolonged storage was described for all four ropy isolates at varied temperatures. Instability during transfer was reported as moderate with a loss of no more than 45% of ropy colonies after 15 subcultures at 48&#176;C A significant increase in instability, during transfer, associated with an increase in incubation temperature (37-48&#176;C) was also reported. Prolonged storage of ropy variants over ten days resulted in a drop in the number of ropy colonies. The loss was minimal when cultures were stored at 8&#176;C, but excessive (approaching 100%) at 37&#176;C This suggested the presence of capsular degradative substances.
Analysis of the plasmid profiles of 20 strains identified only two strains harboured plasmid DNA. All plasmids were small, less than 23kilobases, and each strain possessed a single plasmid species. Only one ropy strain contained plasmid DNA that was shown, with the aid of curing experiments, not to be linked to production of the ropy phenotype.
 
The amino acid analogue p-fluoro-DL-phenylalanine was unsuccessful in generating ropy colonies from non-ropy variants of Streptococcus thermophilus at low concentrations. Some technological considerations for the use of ropy variants of Streptococcus thermophilus in yoghurt starter cultures were made.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">yoghurt cultures</field><field name="subject">streptococcus thermophilus</field><field name="subject">yoghurt</field><field name="subject">yoghurt starters</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.085849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A behavioural analysis of enforced delays in computerised programmed instruction.</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Glenn</field><field name="description">A cornerstone of much educational research in individualised and automated instruction (e.g., computer-based learning) is the assumption that learners be permitted to set the rate at which they work through the material to be learned. Experiments that have compared learning under conditions of self pacing (determined by the learner) and external pacing (determined by the experimenter), using a variety of tasks and populations, often have not supported this assumption. To evaluate the putative advantages of student self pacing in automated instruction, the studies in this thesis compared the effects of self-paced, and externally-paced, programmed instruction on student accuracy, retention efficiency, and satisfaction.
Under self-pacing conditions, learners completely controlled the rate of progress through learning materials; that is, although the program paused when learners were required to provide answers, score answers, and proceed to the next item, it continued as soon as the learner pressed any key. External pacing was operationalised by programming a noncontingent 10-s postfeedback delay after every item; that is, learners could not progress to a subsequent item until the delay period was over. All relevant learning material for the current item was present during the delay. In a series of experiments using an alternating conditions design, learners completed approximately 40 sets of a programmed course in behaviour analysis (Holland &amp; Skinner, 1961). A baseline of self-pacing conditions was followed by an experimental phase in which baseline conditions were randomly alternated with one or more experimental conditions. Later experiments also included a return to baseline conditions.
In Experiments 1 and 2 externally-imposed delays resulted in greater accuracy than self pacing. This advantage occurred when the delays were accompanied by the study materials, but did not occur for a condition in which delays were presented without the learning material being visible. Hence, it was proposed that noncontingent postfeedback delays are effective because they provide a study opportunity which is otherwise not taken. In addition, imposing delays only slightly increased overall time to completion, and learners rated their satisfaction with external and self pacing similarly.
Experiments 3 and 4 replicated the accuracy advantage found for external pacing, and showed also that material learned under these conditions was recalled better in both immediate and 1-month delayed posttests. These experiments also provided information about factors that influence efficiency during completion of materials. One of these factors was a requirement that, at the end of an instructional
 
set, each question answered incorrectly be repeated until it was answered correctly (i.e., review feature). This is part of the standard implementation of programmed materials and had been employed in all conditions. In the earlier studies, externally-paced and self-paced conditions showed little difference in overall time to completion. It was apparent that although the externally-paced condition had an increased task time due to enforced delays, this condition did not take longer overall because more errors were made in self pacing, so more items were reviewed, and the overall time of a session was increased. Therefore, although imposing delays entailed a time cost, this was offset because it reduced the number of errors and time-consuming repeats. Experiment 4 demonstrated that when the review requirement was removed, noncontingent delays caused an increase in overall time to completion. Another factor determining efficiency was workrate during nondelay components of the task. Measures of the time learners spent responding, correcting responses, and continuing to subsequent frames, indicated that delays promoted faster workrates at each of these points. This was interpreted as evidence of a generalised escape motivation that is increased by being delayed and which offsets some of the time lost due to delays.
The final two experiments investigated the effects of reviewing incorrect items on student performance because it had been a potential confound in previous experiments. Previously, both self-pacing and external-pacing conditions required subjects to repeat incorrect items until answered correctly. It is possible that because reviewing items increased time on task (like imposed delays), they also led to compensatory changes in workrate, and influenced timing and efficiency measures. Any such influence was not controlled across experimental conditions, however, because self pacing typically resulted in more errors and larger reviews, and any influence of review size on timing measures could not be separated from the effect of delays. It was found that, compared to a no-review condition, reviews reduced efficiency and had little influence on accuracy and retention. Hence, this feature was unlikely to have interacted with the delay variable in previous experiments.
In conclusion, the results of the experiments show that self pacing reduced accuracy, retention, and workrates compared to external pacing. These studies indicate that learners often make poor choices about optimum learning conditions. They also show that small changes in the learning environment can result in consistent and substantial changes in learner performance, and that behaviour analysts have an important role to play in the design and implementation of instructional materials.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">behavioral assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.090627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A process analysis of the solution strategies used for problems contained in the Minnesota paper form board test.</field><field name="creator">Reid, Alan Forbes</field><field name="description">This thesis reviews progress toward an understanding of the processes involved in the solution of spatial problems. Previous work employing factor analysis and information processing analysis is reviewed and the emphasis on variations in speed and accuracy as the major contributers to individual differences is noted. It is argued that the strategy used by individuals is a preferable explanatory concept for identifying the cognitive substratum necessary for problem solving.
Using the protocols obtained from subjects solving The Minnesota Paper Form Board (Revised), a test commonly regarded as measuring skill in spatial visualization, a number of different strategies are isolated. Assumptions as to the task variants which undergird these strategies are made and tested experimentally. The results suggest that task variants such as the size of the stimulus and the shape of the pieces interact with subject variables to produce the operating strategy. Skill in problem solving is revealed in the ability to structure the array, to hold a structured image and to reduce the number of answers requiring intensive processing. The interaction between task and subject variables results in appropriate or inappropriate strategies which in turn affect speed and accuracy.
Results suggest that strategy formation and usage are the keys to explaining individual differences and an heuristic model is presented to explain the performance of individual subjects on the problems involved in the Minnesota Paper Form Board. The model can be used to predict performance on other tests; and as an aid to teaching subjects experiencing difficulties.
The model presented incorporates strategy variation and is consequently mores complex than previously suggested models. It is argued that such complexity is necessary to explain the nature of a subject's performance and is also necessary to perform diagnostic evaluation.
Certain structural -features of the Minnesota Paper Form Board are questioned and suggestions for improvement included. The essential explanatory function of the strategy in use makes the prevalent group administration approach suspect in the prediction of future performance in spatial or vocational activity.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">space perception</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="subject">Minnesota Paper Form Board</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.091742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of exercise in the development of bone strength during growth.</field><field name="creator">Saxon, Leanne</field><field name="description">Exercise during growth may increase peak bone mass; if the benefits are maintained it may reduce the risk of fracture later in life (1). It is hypothesised that exercise will preferentially enhance bone formation on the surface of cortical bone that is undergoing bone modeling at the time (2). Therefore, exercise may increase bone mass accrual on the outer periosteal surface during the pre- and peri-pubertal years, and on the inner endocortical surface during puberty (3). An increase in bone formation on the periosteal surface is, however, more effective for increasing bone strength than medullary contraction (4).
While exercise may have a role in osteoporosis prevention, there is little evidential basis to support this notion. It is generally accepted that weight-bearing exercise is important, but it is not known how much, how often, what magnitude or how long children need to exercise before a clinically important increase in bone density is obtained.
In this thesis, the effect of exercise on the growing skeleton is investigated in two projects. The first quantifies the magnitude and number of loads associated with and in a moderate and low impact exercise program and non-structured play. The second project examines how exercise affects bone size and shape during different stages of growth.
Study One: The Assessment of the Magnitude of Exercise Loading and the Skeletal Response in Girls
Questions: 1) Does moderate impact exercise lead to a greater increase in BMC than low impact exercise? 2) Does loading history influence the osteogenic response to moderate impact exercise? 3) What is the magnitude and number of loads that are associated with a moderate and low impact exercise program?
Methods: Sixty-eight pre-and early-pubertal girls (aged 8.9&#177;0.2 years) were randomised to either a moderate or low impact exercise regime for 8.5-months. In each exercise
 
group the girls received either calcium fortified (-2000 mg/week) or non-fortified foods for the duration of the study. The magnitude and number of loads associated with the exercise programs and non-structured play were assessed using a Pedar in-sole mobile system and video footage, respectively.
Findings: After adjusting for baseline BMC, change in length and calcium intake, the girls in the moderate exercise intervention showed greater increases in BMC at the tibia (2.7%) and total body (1.3%) (p &#8804;0.05). Girl's who participated in moderate impact sports outside of school, showed greater gains in BMC in response to the moderate impact exercise program compared to the low impact exercise program (2.5 to 4.5%, p &#8804;0.06 to 0.01). The moderate exercise program included -400 impacts per class, that were applied in a dynamic manner and the magnitude of impact was up to 4 times body weight.
Conclusion: Moderate-impact exercise may be sufficient to enhance BMC accrual during the pre-pubertal years. However, loading history is likely to influence the osteogenic response to additional moderate impact exercise. These findings contribute towards the development of school-based exercise programs aimed at improving bone health of children.
Study Two: Exercise Effect on Cortical Bone Morphology During Different Stages of Maturation in Tennis Players
Questions: 1) How does exercise affect bone mass (BMC) bone geometry and bone strength during different stages of growth? 2) Is there an optimal stage during growth when exercise has the greatest affect on bone strength?
Methods: MRI was used to measure average total bone, cortical and medullary areas at the mid- and distal-regions of the playing and non-playing humerii in 47 pre-, peri- and post-pubertal competitive female tennis players aged 8 to 17 years. To assess bone rigidity, each image was imported into Scion Image 4.0.2 and the maximum, minimum
 
and polar second moments of area were calculated using a custom macro. DXA was used to measure BMC of the whole humerus. Longitudinal data was collected on 37 of the original cohort.
Findings: Analysis of the entire cohort showed that exercise was associated with increased BMC and cortical area (8 to 14%), and bone rigidity (11 to 23%) (all p &#8804;0.05). The increase in cortical bone area was associated with periosteal expansion in the pre-pubertal years and endocortical contraction in the post-pubertal years (p &#8804;0.05). The exercise-related gains in bone mass that were accrued at the periosteum during the pre-pubertal years, did not increase with advanced maturation and/or additional training.
Conclusion: Exercise increased cortical BMC by enhancing bone formation on the periosteal surface during the pre-pubertal years and on the endocortical surface in the post-pubertal years. However, bone strength only increased in response to bone acquisition on the periosteal surface. Therefore the pre-pubertal years appear to be the most opportune time for exercise to enhance BMC accrual and bone strength</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">osteoporosis</field><field name="subject">bones</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">exercise for children</field><field name="subject">bone strength</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.095337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power and politics in a system implementation.</field><field name="creator">Peszynski, Konrad Janusz</field><field name="description">The central concern of this study is to identify the role of power and politics in systems implementation. The current literature on systems implementation is typically divided into two areas, process modelling and factor based studies. Process modelling classifies the implementation into a linear process, whereas factor based studies have argued that in order to &#145;successfully&#146; implement a system, particular critical factors are required. This literature misses the complexities involved in systems implementation through the human factors and political nature of systems implementation and is simplistic in its nature and essentially de-contextualises the implementation process.
Literature has investigated some aspects of human factors in systems implementation. However, it is believed that these studies have taken a simplistic view of power and politics. It is argued in this thesis that human factors in systems implementation are constantly changing and essentially operating in a dynamic relationship affecting the implementation process. The concept of power relations, as proposed by Foucault (1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1982), have been utilised in order to identify the dynamic nature of power and politics. Foucault (1978) argued that power is a dynamic set of relationships constantly changing from one point in time to the next. It is this recognition that is lacking from information systems. Furthermore, these power relations are created through the use of discourse. Discourse represents meaning and social relationships, forming both subjectivity and power relations. Discourses are also the practices of talk, text and argument that continuously form that which actors speak.
A post-structuralist view of power as both an obvious and hidden concept has provided the researcher a lens through which the selection and implementation of an enterprise-wide learning management system can be observed. The framework aimed to identify the obvious process of system selection implementation, and then deconstruct that process to expose the hegemonic nature of policy, the reproduction of organisational culture, the emancipation within discourse, and the nature of resistance and power relations. A critical case study of the selection and implementation of an enterprise-wide learning management system at the University of Australia was presented providing an in-depth investigation of the implementation
of an enterprise-wide learning management system, spanning five years. This critical case study was analysed using social dramas to distinguish between the front stage issues of power and the hidden discourses underpinning the front stage dramas. The enterprise-wide learning management system implemented in the University of Australia in 2003 is a system which enables academic staff to manage learners, the students, by keeping track of their progress and performance across all types of training activities.
Through telling the story of the selection and implementation of an enterprise-wide learning management system at the University of Australia discourses emerged. The key findings from this study have indicated that the system selection and implementation works at two levels. The low level is the selection and implementation process, which operates for the period of the project. The high level is the arena of power and politics, which runs simultaneously to the selection and implementation process. Challenges for power are acted out in the front stage, or public forums between various actors. The social dramas, as they have been described here, are superfluous to the discourse underpinning the front stage. It is the discourse that remains the same throughout the system selection and implementation process, but it is through various social dramas that reflect those discourses. Furthermore, the enactment of policy legitimises power and establishes the discourse, limiting resistance. Additionally, this research has identified the role of the &#145;State&#146; and its influence at the organisational level, which had been previously suggested in education literature (Ball, 1990).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organizational change</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">management information systems</field><field name="subject">information resource management</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.100244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soldier settlement after world war one in south western Victoria.</field><field name="creator">Frost, Ken</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the physical aspects of farming on soldier settlement blocks in south west Victoria. The undeveloped land, high establishment costs, stock losses through animal diseases and lack of managerial skills all contributed to the settlers' inability to meet their financial commitments. These factors are analysed, as are the effects of declining rural commodities prices during the 1920s and 1930s.
In addition, the relationship between the settlers and the successive administrative agencies is examined. The scheme was administered by the Closer Settlement Board from its inception until 1932 and much of the discussion during this period concerns the interaction between settler and inspector. Soldier settlement after World War One represented one of the last attempts to create a large body of 'yeoman' farmers. From the early 1920s there was an increasing dichotomy between the 'yeoman' and the 'managerial' ideologies. This dichotomy placed additional pressure on soldier settlers who were expected to be 'efficient' without adequate finances.
In the post C.S.B. era, the focus shifts to the attempts by the Closer Settlement Commission to salvage the scheme and its greater understanding of the problems faced by the settlers. While this part of the thesis necessarily becomes more political, the physical and financial environment in which the soldier settlers worked was still an important factor in their success or failure. Unlike the C.S.B. which tended to blame soldier settlers for their situation, the Commission acknowledged that settlers' ability to succeed was often constrained by circumstances beyond their control. Under the latter administration, instalments were written off, additional land was allocated and finally the blocks were revalued to guarantee the men at least some equity in their farms. Those settlers who had survived until these changes were instituted received a 'successful outcome of their life's work'.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soldier settlement</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">soldier settlement</field><field name="subject">land settlement</field><field name="subject">veterans</field><field name="subject">world war one</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.102701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing bodies, changing discourses: Women's experiences of early menopause.</field><field name="creator">McGuiness, Sheralyn</field><field name="description">Early menopause has been constructed by discourses of biological determinism as an untimely, but natural, failure of the female body. Medical discourses in particular have interpreted early menopause as a congenital irregularity and a rare anomaly of menopause at midlife. In this thesis I challenge the notion that early menopause is an innate imperfection related only to women&#146;s age. I propose that early menopause is dependent upon the cultural interpretations of individual women and is constituted through the mercurial and multiple discourses of women who have this embodied experience. Moreover, I reveal that early menopause is a contemporary condition and that its location in history is inextricably bound to discourses of risk, naturalism and the self. Further I make the assumption that having an early menopause both affects and is an effect of women&#146;s fertility, sexuality and subjectivity.
I have drawn upon a broad range of sources to provide a sociological analysis of early menopause. Literature on early menopause is dominated by positivist discourses, yet many alternate discourses negotiate these influential constructions. I suggest here that the perception of early menopause as a natural fault is merely a construction by medical discourses and does not incorporate the dynamic discourses of early-menopausal women. Moreover, the restriction of early menopause to a genetic female failure excludes the majority of women who have an early menopause through iatrogenisis. This omission occurs through the failure of positivist discourses to accommodate diversity in discourses.
Recent sociological and feminist studies have vindicated menopausal women. They have reconstructed menopause through notions of embodiment and have removed the veil of negativity used by the medical sciences to contain menopausal women (Komesaroff, Rothfield and Daly 1997). The visibility of menopausal women, however, remains connected to age. Menopause has been created as a predictable consequence of aging and as such has come to be synonymous with middle age. Nowadays, even men are said to experience menopause at midlife (Carruthers 1996).
But early menopause is constituted within the discourses of women who have this experience. Medico-scientific discourses, based upon theories of genetic inevitability, disregard this perspective. Consequently early menopause is subsumed by naturalistic discourses that relate menopause to midlife. Such restraint reflects the unease created by menopause that does not coincide with prescribed life stages. Women's experiences of their changing bodies are largely unheard. Thus, women who have an early menopause are faced with a chasm of &#145;cultural non-recognition&#146; (Fraser 1997).
Conjointly with this discursive repression early-menopausal women face social imbalances that are transacted as both cause and consequence of early menopause. In particular the contemporary creation of early menopause is bound to the social and historical location of women as a group. Women are exploited by the institution of medicine, &#145;exposure to environmental toxicity&#146; (Fraser 1997: 11) and commercialization as causes of early menopause. Yet the corporeal effects of practices of risk avoidance (Beck 1993), social practices (Shilling 1993) and Western consumerism (Lupton 1994) fail to be recognized.
I address these problematics through a poststructural and feminist critique that assumes moments of commonality among women, while at the same time recognizes shifting and multiple differences (Nicholson 1999). I suggest here that early menopause falls into cultural misrecognition in Fraser's (1997) terms and argue that it is united concurrently with the gender injustice of androcentrism (Fraser 1997: 21). Fraser (1997: 16) suggests that it is only by relating these dual problematics that we are able to make
 
sense of current dilemmas. Thus I have critiqued early menopause through a connection between individual embodied experiences of early menopause and early menopause as a modern phenomenon that is specific to women. I have attempted to unravel these arguments that simultaneously call to &#145;... abolish gender differentiation and to valorize gender specificity&#146; (Fraser 1997: 21) while at the same time acknowledging their interconnectedness. An approach of merely combining women&#146;s discourses with overarching social issues would be inadequate as not only do these problematics intersect but they also can be opposed. As Fraser (1997: 25) notes with her theory, redressing one aspect of cultural or social analysis can further imbalance another.
For instance making visible the diversity and uniqueness of individual experiences of early menopause could detract from acknowledging the contemporary construction of early menopause through social inequality. Crucial to this understanding is a destabilizing of the binary construction of differences between the sexes that makes way for a reconstruction of early menopause through &#145;sexual slippage&#146; (Matus 1995). In this thesis I look for a subtlety between the particular and the collective that views early menopause as concurrently a singular and changeable experience as well as imbedded in social practice. I suggest that these concepts are entwined as interactive effects of early menopause. Thus I have analyzed the bivalent problematics of the embodiment and social location of early menopause as imbricated, dynamic and unending discourses.
From this perspective I reviewed the literature that was available on early menopause. In Chapter One I look to descriptions of early menopause and note that it has disappeared into a conglomeration of disparate, mostly medical, discourses that are contradictory. Nevertheless medical discourses offer &#145;conclusive&#146; definitions of early menopause that are based on naturalistic views of the body (Shilling 1994). The determinants used are inconsistent and do not include women's discourses of early menopause. Thus, dominant medical discourses obscure women&#146;s embodied experiences of early menopause and ignore the contemporary causes of early menopause.
In Chapter Two I examine the causes of early menopause as a way of explaining the disparity between medical discourses and my anecdotal observations of early menopause as a fairly common contemporary occurrence. The relatively recent escalation in gynaecological surgery, especially hysterectomy, appears to account almost single-handedly for early menopause as a current phenomenon. Moreover, the extraordinary number of women who have their uterus removed at hysterectomy can be interpreted as a modern implementation of ancient anxieties. Women's sexuality has been constructed throughout history as problematic and this unease has been translated through women's bodies as dangerous and in need of control (Greer 1992). Thus social concerns which have evolved historically have emerged through the representation of a woman's uterus as an unseen, dark and mysterious risk (Beck 1993). Medical discourses define this risk and are able to negate the so-called dangers of women's sexuality through the surgical removal of their organs. Widespread negotiation of medical discourses is apparent, as hysterectomy in the modern Western world is the most common of all surgical operations (Hufnagel 1989). It is overwhelmingly the most common cause of early menopause as well.
I examine also the historical condemnation of infertile women and how this anxiety has been transposed to the modern world through the commercialization of reproduction. Transactions of this social unease can cause early menopause. For instance the medical technology of in-vitro fertilization (I.V.F.) has been offered as a panacea for the infertility of early menopause but, paradoxically, can cause early menopause as well. Conception through technology has been normalized as a viable option for women who
 
are unable to conceive and understandings of I.V.F. have moved into everyday discourse. Medical discourses have constructed fertility as a saleable item and infertile women expect that they can purchase this merchandise. Human eggs have become lucrative commodities that now are available in the market place. Egg &#145;donation&#146; for I.V.F. programs can hasten the attrition rate of eggs and can cause early menopause in some pre-menopausal women (Rowland 1992: 24). Even the recycling of a woman&#146;s uterus supposedly has become a possibility through the transferring of this &#145;used&#146; organ at hysterectomy to a recipient woman who can use the other woman&#146;s uterus as a &#145;gestational garage&#146; (Rogers 1998). In this way women have been disembodied as mechanical systems with inter-changeable body parts and the potentially detrimental consequences of these commercial transactions are ignored.
In addition I show how early menopause can be caused by the connection between the self and the social structure. Women's subjectivity is constituted through the cultural discourses available to them and these discourses affect social behaviour (Lupton 1995). For instance smoking and dieting have been identified as causes of early menopause. These activities have been related to the creation of women&#146;s bodies as hetero-sexually desirable and are endemic to young women (Evans-Young 1995). This suggests that cultural causes of early menopause are transactions of sexual politics. Yet there is a paucity of literature that acknowledges the relationship between women&#146;s subjectivity and early menopause. Thus the second chapter exposes a link between sexual politics and causes of early menopause through women's relationships with risk, naturalism and the self.
In Chapter Three I deconstruct early menopause through theoretical considerations. I rely on an overarching poststructuralism that embraces the concept of fragmented plural discourses and the subjectivity of menopausal women as a continuous process (Komesaroff 1997: 61). I have woven these variables through broad feminist critiques (Leonard 1997). Through this eclectic approach I hoped to find some loose alignment between the corporeal, ontological and embodied dimensions of early menopause. The recurring themes of sexuality, fertility and subjectivity emerge through deconstructing discourses of sexual difference as immutable and non-negotiable; exposing &#145;premature ovarian failure&#146; as a discursive construction that censures early-menopausal women; and acknowledging the discourses of individual women as unique, diverse and dynamic. I looked to a method of exposing some of these individual discourses and in Chapter Four I describe a critical research process aimed at understanding early menopause as a lived experience.
In the remaining chapters I align these ontological arguments with an analysis of the discourses of women who had experienced or were experiencing an early menopause. This section partly relieves the &#145;cultural non-recognition&#146; of the discourses of early-menopausal women. I recorded the narratives of fifty early-menopausal women through in-depth interviews and used this empirical data to direct the study. This data provides the opportunity to understand early menopause as an assortment of embodied experiences. For instance women&#146;s experiences of age at commencement of menopause spanned over three and half decades. They did not reflect the age specifications prescribed by medical discourses. Rather women interpreted their experiences within their own discourses and determined their menopause as early based upon the expectations of their cultural context. Many of the women experienced changes attributed to menopause at midlife. It was not these changes that were significant to early-menopausal women it was how each woman translated these changes that provided meanings of early menopause.
 
In Chapter Five I introduce the women through a table that connects the varying experiences of each woman. This profile shows that, in the main, the women&#146;s experiences of early menopause were unexpected. I suggest that this is due to the disparity between early-menopausal women&#146;s experiences and the current age and social norms of menopause. By bracketing the women into cohorts patterns emerged displaying differences between women who had menopause in their teens, twenties, thirties and forties. Adolescent women had intense feelings of abnormality and despair. Women who were in their twenties were less devastated by menopause than the younger women but described their sexuality and self-identity as changing. And although some women in their thirties were shocked or dismayed to have an early menopause others were ambivalent or happy. These women also described their sexuality and self-identity through changing discourses. A number of the women who were in their forties said that they were &#145;too young for the menopause&#146; but were far less despondent than the younger women. It seemed that the greater the distance between age norms and social norms the more negatively women responded. Age norms that determine the social norms of women's lives through a &#145;biological clock&#146; are constructed to reflect social values. But age is a social construction that changes over time. Thus it would appear that women&#146;s changing bodies and changing discourses of early menopause are in the process of recreating age and social norms around menopause.
In Chapter Six I draw upon women&#146;s narratives that describe a connection between early menopause and sexuality. Yet the respondents were not unified in their constructions of sexuality. For instance a number of the women rejected the containment of their sexuality as absolute and defined in terms of bi-lateral hetero-sexual opposition. The discourses of these women constructed their sexuality as continuously flexible. Some early-menopausal women described this sexual mobility as an equivocal relationship between their sexuality, reproductive capacity and female organs. Other women articulated their sexuality as vacillating, ambiguous and unrepresentative of the so-called &#145;true woman&#146;. Several felt that they were not meant to have female reproductive organs at all. Nearly one third of the women had had their uterus removed at hysterectomy and the reproductive organs of two women were rudimentary.
Women&#146;s narratives showed that the social value of fertility influences constructions of early menopause. In Chapter Seven I record the contrast between the poignant responses of women who wished to have a baby of their own and other women who resisted discourses that entwine reproductivity with being a woman. For instance some women negotiated fertility through economic discourses of consumerism with the expectation that they could purchase conception as a commodity. Other women welcomed their early menopause as freedom from contraceptive concerns and others had no interest in reproduction at all. Thus discord arose through discourses that problematize early-menopausal women as non-reproductive and discourses that value variability.
In addition many of the women&#146;s accounts constructed their subjectivity as mobile, challenging the notion that discourses of the self are immutable. Chapter Eight presents narratives which suggest that the subjectivity of many women was altered continuously by early menopause. Yet some of the women rejected the construction of their subjectivity as unfluctuating. These contradictions reflect the uncertainties of the contemporary world. Nevertheless most respondents found that the tethering of menopause to constructions of midlife was incongruous with their own experiences. Many women refused to accept the label of social redundancy attached to middle-aged women. They moved their subjectivity beyond the reproductive body to a shifting and tractable identity of the self.
 
This thesis demonstrates that the medical construction of early menopause as a rare and natural female flaw varies from women's experiences which suggest that early menopause is common and discursively constructed. This disparity has occurred through the privilege placed upon the construction of bodies as immutable and sexually static. This privileging has obscured the multi-dimensional causes of early menopause and given preference to a mono-causal theory. By exposing the variety of causes of early menopause the medical construction of women through a universal and unalterable body of reproduction is challenged. Moreover, women's discourses of early menopause demonstrate that the medical reduction of early menopause to a spontaneous bio-chemical malfunction has ignored the volatility of women&#146;s embodied experiences. Women experience early menopause variously and through mercurial discourses.
I suggest here that women's discourses of their experiences of early menopause reflect recurring and restructuring philosophical quandaries of fertility, sexuality and subjectivity. While there can be no representative claims made from this thesis it contributes to an understanding of the embodied experiences of early menopause. It provides an understanding of the creation of early menopause through social practices and goes part way to redressing the problematics of what Fraser terms &#145;cultural non-recognition&#146;. But, more importantly, it acknowledges early menopause as a variety of experiences where women interpret their changing bodies through changing discourses.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">menopause</field><field name="subject">body image in women</field><field name="subject">menopause</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.103947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mermaids and sirens as myth fragments in contemporary literature.</field><field name="creator">Trigg, Susan Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis examines three works: Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride and Alias Grace, and Angela Carter's Nights at the Circus. All three novels feature female characters that contain elements or myth fragments of mermaids and sirens. The thesis asserts that the images of the mermaid and siren have undergone a gradual process of change, from literal mythical figures, to metaphorical images, and then to figures or myth fragments that reference the original mythical figures. The persistence of these female half-human images points to an underlying rationale that is independent of historical and cultural factors. Using feminist psychoanalytic theoretical frameworks, the thesis identifies the existence of the siren/mermaid myth fragments that are used as a means to construct the category of the 'bad' woman. It then identifies the function that these references serve in the narrative and in the broader context of both Victorian and contemporary societies. The thesis postulates the origin of the mermaid and siren myths as stemming from the ambivalent relationship that the male infant forms with the mother as he develops an identity as an individual. Finally, the thesis discusses the manner in which Atwood and Carter build on this foundation to deconstruct the binary oppositions that disadvantage women and to expand the category of female.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Margaret Eleanor Atwood</field><field name="subject">Angela Carter</field><field name="subject">criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">mermaids</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.104438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of dietary arachidonic acid and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on the production of eicosanoids.</field><field name="creator">Mann, Neil James</field><field name="description">The major polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in the western diet is linoleic acid (LA), which is considered to be the major source of tissue arachidonic acid (AA), the principal precursor for the vaso-active eicosanoids via the cyclooxygenase enzymatic pathway. However, dietary AA may contribute significantly to tissue levels of AA in humans, leading to an increase in the production of eicosanoids, particularly the platelet aggregating, vasoconstricting, thromboxane (TXA2), hence increasing thrombosis risk. The aims of this study were to determine the extent to which dietary AA contributed to prostacyclin (PGI2) and TXA2 production in vivo and whether dietary long chain (LC) n-3 PUFA have a modulating influence on the metabolism of AA to these vaso-active eicosanoids. A gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GCMS) method for urinary PGI2-M determination and a tandem GCMS/MS method for urinary TXA2-M determination were perfected for use within our laboratory (with the assistance of Dr Howard Knapp, University of Iowa and Professor Reinhard Lorenz, Ludwig Maximilian's University, Munich, respectively).
An initial animal study compared the in vitro production of PGI2 by aorta segments with the whole body in vivo production of PGI2 in rats fed ethyl arachidonate or the ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), at levels many times higher than encountered in human diets. During AA feeding both measures of PGI2 increased, although in vitro TXA2 production was not affected. EPA feeding lowered in vitro TXA2 and in vivo PGI2.
Prior to determining the effects of AA and LC n-3 PUFA in humans, a study was carried out to determine the AA and LC n-3 PUFA content of foods and from these, an estimate of the mean daily intake of AA and other LC PUFA. Eggs, organ meats and pat&#233; were found to be the richest sources of AA. Of the meat and fish analysed, white meat was found to be relatively rich in AA but poor in LC n-3 PUFA. Lean red meat, particularly kangaroo had similar LC n-3 PUFA and AA content. Fish, although rich in AA, had extremely high levels of LC n-3 PUFA. The calculated mean daily intakes of AA in Australian adults was 130mg (males) and 96mg (females). For total LC n-3 PUFA intake, the mean daily values were 247mg (males) and 197mg (females).
Two human pilot studies involving dietary intervention trials examined the effects of dietary AA and AA plus long chain n-3 PUFA on thrombosis risk, gauged by the change in the ratio of PGI2 / TXA2 as well as alterations to other recognised risk factors, such as lipoprotein lipids and platelet aggregation. The desired dietary amounts of AA and LC n-3 PUFA were achieved in the first study by combining food items with known levels of each fatty acid. In the
 
second study, where a diet with approximately equal quantities of AA and LC n-3 PUFA was being examined, kangaroo meat was consumed, following a low-fat vegetarian diet used as a baseline. Diets rich in AA alone (~500mg/day) increased plasma phospholipid (PL) AA levels, PGIi and TXA2 production. When foods containing equal quantities of AA and EPA (&#8764;500mg/day of each) were fed to subjects PGI2 increased, with no change in TXAs production. Low fat vegetarian diets lowered PGI2 production, the level of which was reestablished by an AA rich diet (&#8764;300mg AA/day + &#8764;260mg/day LC n-3 PUFA) of kangaroo meat. However, TXA2 production was not altered.
A final, larger human dietary intervention trial then examined the effects of diets relatively rich in AA alone, AA plus LC n-3 PUFA and LC n-3 PUFA, on the ratio of PGI2/TXA2- The dietary sources of these fatty acids were white meat, red meat and fish, respectively. Each contained a mean level of AA of &#8764;140mg/day, with varying LC n-3 PUFA levels (59, 161 and 3380mg/day, respectively). Neither meat diet altered PGI2 or TXA2 production significantly, despite increasing serum PL AA levels. The fish diet resulted in a decrease in the serum and platelet PL AA/EPA ratio and TXA2 production, thus increasing the PGI2 / TXA2 ratio. These results would indicate that stores of AA in the body are sufficiently high to have effectively saturated the cyclooxygenase pathway for production of both PGI2 and TXA2, thus making any small change in the plasma level of AA due to 'normal' dietary levels, inconsequential.
However, as seen in the rat study and the two pilot studies higher dietary levels of AA can increase both PGI2 and TXA2 production. Increases in platelet levels of EPA and DHA were associated with a decrease in TXA2 production, or the maintenance of a constant TXA2 level, while AA tissue levels and PGI2 production increased. This suggests a possible inhibitory effect of LC n-3 PUFA on the metabolism of AA to TXA2, particularly in platelets.
From these short term studies, conducted over 2-3 week periods, it can be concluded that diets rich in lean meats can raise plasma AA levels but do not affect TXA2 or PGI2 production, hence are not pro-thrombotic. Diets rich in long chain n-3 PUFA from fish, raise plasma EPA and DHA levels, lower TXA2 production and are anti-thrombotic. Diets which combine equal quantities of AA and LC n-3 PUFA appear to increase PGI2 production while keeping TXA2 production constant. In order for these LC PUFA to have a significant effect on eicosanoid production the dietary intake of these fatty acids through foods such as red meat or white meat would have to be higher than average current Australian consumption levels.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arachidonic acid</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">fatty acids</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular systems</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.105437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a new versatile computer controlled electrochemical/ESR data acquisition system.</field><field name="creator">Mleczko, Richard R</field><field name="description">A new versatile computer controlled electrochemlcal/ESR data acquisition system has been developed for the Investigation of short-lived radicals with life-times of 20 milliseconds and greater, Different computer programs have been developed to monitor the decay of radicals; over hours or minutes, seconds or milliseconds. Signal averaging and Fourier smoothing is employed in order to improve the signal to noise ratio.
Two microcomputers are used to control the system, one home-made computer containing the M6800 chip which controls the magnetic field, and an IBM PC XT which controls the electrochemistry and the data acquisition.

The system functions by having the radical generated by an electrochemical pulse: after or during the pulse the ESR data are collected.
Decaying radicals which have half-lives of seconds or greater have their spectra collected in the magnetic field domain, which can be swept as fast as 200 Gauss per second.
The decay of the radicals in the millisecond region is monitored by time-resolved ESR: a technique in which data is collected in both the time domain and in the magnetic field domain. Previously, time-resolved ESR has been used (without field modulation) to investigate ultra-short-lived species with life-times in the region of only a few microseconds.
The application of the data acquisition system to chemical systems is illustrated.

Studies in humans showed that circulating leptin concentrations were positively associated with adiposity, and independently associated with circulating insulin and triglyceride concentrations. Analysis of two leptin receptor sequence polymorphisms in a Caucasian Australian population and a population of Nauruan males, with very high prevalence rates of obesity, showed no associations between sequence variation within the OB-R gene and obesity- or diabetes-related phenotypic measures. In addition, these two OB-R polymorphisms were not associated with longitudinal changes in body mass or composition in either of the populations examined. A unique analysis of the effects of multiple gene defects in the Nauruan population, demonstrated that the presence of sequence alterations in both the OB and OB-R genes were associated with insulin resistance.
Psammomys obesus is regarded as an excellent rodent model in which to study the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans. Examination of circulating leptin concentrations in Psammomys revealed that, as in humans, leptin concentrations were associated with adiposity, and independently associated with circulating insulin concentrations. This animal model was utilised to examine expression of OB-R, and the regulation of expression of this gene after dietary manipulation.
OB-R is known to have several isoforms, and in particular, OB-RA and OB-RB gene expression were examined. OB-RB is the main signalling isoform of the leptin receptors. It has a long intracellular domain and has previously been shown to play an important role in energy balance and body weight regulation in rodents and humans. OB-RA is a much shorter isoform of OB-R, and although it lacks the long intracellular domain necessary to activate the JAK/STAT pathway, OB-RA is also capable of signalling, although to a lesser degree than OB-RB. OB-RA is found to be expressed almost ubiquitously throughout the body, and this isoform may be involved in transport of leptin into the cell, although its role remains unclear.
 
OB-RA and OB-RB were both found to be expressed in a large number of tissues in Psammomys obesus. Interestingly, obese Psammomys were found to have lower levels of expression of OB-RA and OB-RB in the hypothalamus, compared to lean animals. This finding raises the possibility that decreased leptin signalling in the brain of obese, hyperleptinemic Psammomys obesus may contribute to the leptin resistance previously described in this animal model. However, the primary defect is unclear, as alternatively, increased circulating leptin concentrations may lead to down-regulation of leptin receptors.
The effect of fasting on leptin concentrations and gene expression of OB-RA and OB-RB was also examined. A 24-hour fast resulted in no change in body weight, but a reduction in circulating leptin concentrations, and an increase in hypothalamic OB-RB gene expression in lean Psammomys. In obese animals, fasting again did not alter body weight, but resulted in an increase in both circulating leptin concentrations and hypothalamic OB-RB gene expression. In the liver, fasting resulted in a large increase in OB-RA gene expression in both lean and obese animals. These results highlighted the fact that regulation of leptin receptor gene expression in polygenic models of obesity and type 2 diabetes is complex, and not solely under the control of circulating leptin concentrations. Sucrose-feeding is an established method of inducing obesity and type 2 diabetes in rodents, and this experimental paradigm was utilised to examine the effects of longer term perturbations of energy balance on the leptin signalling pathway in Psammomys obesus. Addition of a 5% sucrose solution to the diet of lean and obese Psammomys resulted in increased body weight in both groups of animals, however only obese Psammomys showed increased fat mass and the development of type 2 diabetes. The changes in body mass and composition with sucrose-feeding were accompanied by decreased circulating leptin concentrations in both groups of animals, as well as a range of changes in leptin receptor gene expression.
Sucrose-feeding increased hypothalamic OB-RB gene expression in obese Psammomys only, while in the liver there was evidence of a reduction in OB-RA and OB-RB gene expression in both lean and obese animals. The direct effects of sucrose on the leptin signalling pathway are unclear, however it is possible to speculate that
 
the effect of sucrose to decrease leptin concentrations may have been involved in the exacerbation of obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes in obese Psammomys,
From these studies, it appears that sequence variation in the OB and OB-R genes is unlikely to be a major factor in the etiology of obesity in human populations. The ability to examine regulation of expression of these genes in Psammomys obesus, however, has demonstrated that the effects of nutritional modifications on leptin receptor gene expression need closer attention. The role of the OB and OB-R genes in metabolism and the development of type 2 diabetes also warrants further examination, with particular attention on the differential effects of dietary modifications on leptin receptor gene expression across a range of tissues.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">hormone receptors</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.111246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the behaviour of polystyrene in reversed phase chromatography.</field><field name="creator">Shalliker, Ross Andrew</field><field name="description">Polystyrene behaviour in reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography was influenced mainly by the solvent system, but secondary affects were observed depending on the stationary phase. A variety of reversed phase columns were investigated using mobile phase combinations of dichlorom ethane-methanol, dichloromethane-acetonitrile, ethyl acetate-methanol and ethyl acetate-acetonitrile. Several different modes of behaviour were observed depending on the polymer solubility in the solvent system.
In the dichloromethane-methanol solvent system, polymer-stationary phase interactions only occurred when the molecules had pore access. Retention of excluded polystyrene depended on the kinetics of precipitation and redissolution of the polymer.  Peak splitting and band broadening occurred when the kinetics were slow and molecular weight separations were limited !o oligomers and polystyrenes lower than 5-10(4) dalton.
Excellent molecular weight separations of polystyrenes were obtained using gradient elution reversed phase chromatography with a dichloromethane-acetonitrile mobile phase on C18 columns. The retention was based on polymer-stationary phase interactions regardless of the column pore size.  Separations were obtained on large diameter pellicular adsorbents that were almost as good as those obtained on porous adsorbents, showing that pore access was not essential for the retention of high molecular weight polystyrenes.   In the best example, the separation ranged from the monomer to 10(6) dalton in a single analysis.  Very little adsorption of excluded polymers was observed on C8 or phenyl columns.
Polystyrene molecular weight separations to 7-10(5) dalton were obtained in an ethyl acetate-acetonitrile solvent system on C18 columns.  Adsorption was responsible for retention.   When an ethyl acetate-methanol solvent system was used, no molecular weight separations were obtained because of complex peak splitting.
Reversed phase chromatography was compared to size exclusion chromatography for the analysis of polydisperse polystyrenes.   Similar results were obtained using both methods. However, the reversed phase method was less sensitive to concentration effects and gave better resolution.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reversed phase chromatography</field><field name="subject">polystyrene testing</field><field name="subject">chromatographic analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.112118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leptin and the development of obesity.</field><field name="creator">Walder, Ken</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis was leptin and its role in the development of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Studies in Psammomys obesus, a polygenic animal model of obesity and NIDDM, showed that ob gene expression and plasma leptin concentration correlated significantly with body weight, percentage body fat and plasma insulin concentration. In addition, plasma leptin concentrations were significantly elevated in insulin resistant Psammomys obesus independent of body weight. Dietary energy restriction from weaning in Psammomys obesus prevented excessive body weight gain, hyperleptinemia and hyperglycemia compared with ad libitum fed animals. Interestingly, 19% of the energy-restricted animals still developed hyperinsulinemia and tended to have increased plasma leplin compared with normoinsulinemic energy-restricted Psammomys obesus. Fasting for 24 hours significantly reduced plasma leptin concentration in lean, insulin-sensitive but not obese, insulin-resistant P. obesus, suggesting a dysregulation in the response of leptin to acute caloric deprivation in these animals.
The effects of leptin administration to P. obesus were also investigated. Single daily intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg leptin/kg body weight for 14 days had no significant effect in lean or obese P. obesus. This dose had previously been shown to rapidly and significantly reduce food intake and body weight in ob/ob and wild-type mice, suggesting relative leptin resistance in P. obesus. Acute (8 hour) effects of administration of 5 mg leptin/kg body weight were also investigated. No significant effects on food intake or plasma insulin were detected, however blood glucose concentrations were significantly elevated in obese, glucose intolerant P. obexus, suggesting an exacerbation of insulin resistance in susceptible animals. Treatment of lean, healthy P. obesus with 45 mg leptin/kg body weight/day for 7 days resulted in significant decreases in food intake and percentage body fat, showing that the leptin resistance observed in this species could be overcome by the administration of very large doses of leptin.
In another study, leplin was shown to significantly inhibit maximal insulin binding to isolated adipocytes, suggesting that leptin may respresent an important link between obesity and NIDDM. Links between aspects of obesity and NIDDM and polymorphisms in the ob and p3-adrencrgic receptor genes were also investigated in two human populations.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">hormones</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">leptin</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.112630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stability theory and numerical analysis of non-autonomous dynamical systems.</field><field name="creator">Stonier, D. J.</field><field name="description">The development and use of cocycles for analysis of non-autonomous behaviour is a technique that has been known for several years. Initially developed as an extension to semi-group theory for studying rion-autonornous behaviour, it was extensively used in analysing random dynamical systems [2, 9, 10, 12].
Many of the results regarding asymptotic behaviour developed for random dynamical systems, including the concept of cocycle attractors were successfully transferred and reinterpreted for deterministic non-autonomous systems primarily by P. Kloeden and B. Schmalfuss [20, 21, 28, 29]. The theory concerning cocycle attractors was later developed in various contexts specific to particular classes of dynamical systems [6, 7, 13], although a comprehensive understanding of cocycle attractors (redefined as pullback attractors within this thesis) and their role in the stability of non-autonomous dynamical systems was still at this stage incomplete.
It was this purpose that motivated Chapters 1-3 to define and formalise the concept of stability within non-autonomous dynamical systems. The approach taken incorporates the elements of classical asymptotic theory, and refines the notion of pullback attraction with further development towards a study of pull-back stability arid pullback asymptotic stability. In a comprehensive manner, it clearly establishes both pullback and forward (classical) stability theory as fundamentally unique and essential components of non-autonomous stability. Many of the introductory theorems and examples highlight the key properties arid differences between pullback and forward stability. The theory also cohesively retains all the properties of classical asymptotic stability theory in an autonomous environment. These chapters are intended as a fundamental framework from which further research in the various fields of non-autonomous
 
dynamical systems may be extended.
A preliminary version of a Lyapunov-like theory that characterises pullback attraction is created as a tool for examining non-autonomous behaviour in Chapter 5. The nature of its usefulness however is at this stage restricted to the converse theorem of asymptotic stability.
Chapter 7 introduces the theory of Loci Dynamics. A transformation is made to an alternative dynamical system where forward asymptotic (classical asymptotic) behaviour characterises pullback attraction to a particular point in the original dynamical system. This has the advantage in that certain conventional techniques for a forward analysis may be applied.
The remainder of the thesis, Chapters 4, 6 and Section 7.3, investigates the effects of perturbations and discretisations on non-autonomous dynamical systems known to possess structures that exhibit some form of stability or attraction. Chapter 4 investigates autonomous systems with semi-group attractors, that have been non-autonomously perturbed, whilst Chapter 6 observes the effects of discretisation on non-autonomous dynamical systems that exhibit properties of forward asymptotic stability. Chapter 7 explores the same problem of discretisation, but for pullback asymptotically stable systems. The theory of Loci Dynamics is used to analyse the nature of the discretisation, but establishment of results directly analogous to those discovered in Chapter 6 is shown to be unachievable. Instead a case by case analysis is provided for specific classes of dynamical systems, for which the results generate a numerical approximation of the pullback attraction in the original continuous dynamical system.
The nature of the results regarding discretisation provide a non-autonomous extension to the work initiated by A. Stuart and J. Humphries [34, 35] for the numerical approximation of semi-group attractors within autonomous systems. . Of particular importance is the effect on the system's asymptotic behaviour over non-finite intervals of discretisation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stability</field><field name="subject">differentiable dynamical systems</field><field name="subject">cocycles</field><field name="subject">non-autonomous dynamical systems</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051125.113243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aqueous/Micellar peroxyoxalate chemiluminescent detection for ion chromatography.</field><field name="creator">Evans, Raelene Nicole</field><field name="description">This thesis covers the development of the traditionally fluorescent bis(8-quinolinol-5-sulfonic acid) magnesium (II) fluorophore as a chemiluminescent emitter. A brief description of luminescence spectroscopy and its application to analytical chemistry lays the foundation to the discussion of the results obtained herein.
This includes the synthesis and identification of two so called &#145;water soluble&#146; aryl oxamides 2,2&#146;-oxalyl-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imino] ethylene-bis(N- methylpyridinium) trifluoromethane sulfonate (PETQ) and 2,2&#146;-oxalyl-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imino]ethylene-bis(N-pyridinium) chloride (PETH), previously developed for the US navy as a possible emergency light source, yet the synthetic methodology were incomplete. The inconsistencies of the synthetic methods for PETQ and PETH were overcome with yields satisfactory for their preliminary analytical evaluation.
The evaluation of these aryl oxamides, including 4,4&#146;-oxalyI-
bis[(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imino]ethylene-bis(l-methyM-benzylpiperidinium)
trifluoromethanesulfonate (BPTQ), 4,4&#146;-oxalyl-bis [(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imino]
ethylene-bis(N-methylmorpholinium)trifluoromethanesulfonate (METQ) and the
oxalate bis(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl) oxalate (TCPO) were performed with the
peroxyoxalate chemiluminescent reaction using bis(8-quinolinol-5-sulfonic acid)
magnesium (II) as the fluorophore.  A univariate optimisation of this system resulted in
0,0082 mol 1-1 the detection limit of magnesium in the absence of cationic surfactants and
0.0041 mol 1-1 in their presence for the majority of these compounds. The oxamides
were found to be insoluble in water with long ulrasonication periods required to dissolve
the compound, with solvents such as acetonitrile preferred. The determination of other
chemiluminescent metal-8HQS chelates to replace magnesium -8HQS in the
 
peroxyoxalate were limited to Al (III), Cd (II), Ca (II), In (II) and Zn (II), unfortunately these metals all possessed poorer detection limits than those obtained using magnesium The base reaction conditions used for the flow injection system with chemiluminescent detection were transferred to an ion chromatographic configuration for the separation of magnesium from other cations on an exchange column. After a univariate and simplex optimisation of these conditions, the detection limit of magnesium was found to be 0.0411 mol 1-1 which was less than the limits that could be achieved with fluorescent detection, The further development of this reaction to incorporate the displacement of magnesium from Mg-EDTA by other metals that possessed a higher conditional stability constant than magnesium also proved to be problematic with interferences from not only EDTA but from the eluant (lactic acid) from the cation column. Using this system the detection limits of the displacing metals were found to be in the order of 10 mg 1-1 which was substantially less that what was observed when exactly the same configuration was used with fluorescent detection.
The final component of the thesis entails the discussion of the background emission that results from the reaction of oxamides/oxalates with hydrogen peroxide. A detailed investigation into the reaction of TCPO and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of various additives, such as imidazole , heavy atoms and triethylamine illustrated the existence of a further intermediate in fee mechanism for this reaction. The species responsible for this emission was attributed to the degradation product 2,4,6-trichlorophenyi of TCPO, which was supported by the non-existent background present with the oxamides that do not contain this degradation product.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemiluminescence</field><field name="subject">chromatopgraphic analysis</field><field name="subject">TCPO</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051201.143852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the interaction between Xanthorrhoea australis and Phytophthora cinnamomi in south-western Victoria, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Daniel, Rosalie</field><field name="description">Diseases in natural ecosystems are often assumed to be less severe than those observed in domestic cropping systems due to the extensive biodiversity exhibited in wild vegetation communities. In Australia, it is this natural biodiversity that is now under threat from Phytophthora cinnamomi. The soilborne Oomycete causes severe decline of native vegetation communities in south-western Victoria, Australia, disrupting the ecological balance of native forest and heathland communities.
While the effect of disease caused by P. cinnamomi on native vegetation communities in Victoria has been extensively investigated, little work has focused on the Anglesea healthlands in south-western Victoria. Nothing is known about the population structure of P. cinnamomi at Anglesea. This project was divided into two main components to investigate fundamental issues affecting the management of P. cinnamomi in the Anglesea heathlands. The first component examined the phenotypic characteristics of P. cinnamomi isolates sampled from the population at Anglesea, and compared these with isolates from other regions in Victoria, and also from Western Australia. The second component of the project investigated the effect of the fungicide phosphonate on the host response following infection by P. cinnamomi.
Following soil sampling in the Anglesea heathlands, a collection of P, cinnamomi isolates was established. Morphological and physiological traits of each isolate were examined. All isolates were found to be of the A2 mating type. Variation was demonstrated among isolates in the following characteristics: radial growth rate on various nutrient media, sporangial production, and sporangial dimensions. Oogonial dimensions did not differ significantly between isolates. Morphological and physiological variation was rarely dependant on isolate origin.
 
To examine the genetic diversity among isolates and to determine whether phenotypic variation observed was genetically based, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses were conducted. No significant variation was observed among isolates based on an analysis of molecular variance (AMQVA). The results are discussed in relation to population biology, and the effect of genetic variation on population structure and population dynamics.
X australis, an arborescent monocotyledon indigenous to Australia, is highly susceptible to infection by P. cinnamomi. It forms an important component of the heathland vegetation community, providing habitat for native flora and fauna, A cell suspension culture system was developed to investigate the effect of the fungicide phosphonate on the host-pathogen interaction between X. australis and P. cinnamomi. This allowed the interaction between the host and the pathogen to be examined at a cellular level.
Subsequently, histological studies using X. australis seedlings were undertaken to support the cellular study. Observations in the cell culture system correlated well with those in the plant. The anatomical structure of X australis roots was examined to assist in the interpretation of results of histopathological studies. The infection of single cells and roots of X. australis, and the effect of phosphonate on the interaction are described. Phosphonate application prior to inoculation with P. cinnamomi reduced the infection of cells in culture and of cells in planta. In particular, phosphonate was found to stimulate the production of phenolic material in roots of X australis seedlings and in cells in suspension cultures. In phosphonate-treated roots of X australis seedlings, the deposition of electron dense material, possibly lignin or cellulose, was observed following infection with P. cinnamomi. It is proposed that this is a significant consequence of the stimulation of plant defence pathways by the fungicide.
Results of the study are discussed in terms of the implications of the findings on management of the Anglesea heathlands in Victoria, taking into account variation in pathogen morphology, pathogenicity and genotype. The mode of action of phosphonate in the plant is discussed in relation to plant physiology and biochemistry.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="subject">Anglesea</field><field name="subject">Xanthorrhoea</field><field name="subject">Pathogenic microorganisms</field><field name="subject">heathlands</field><field name="subject">fungicides</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051201.144848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A curriculum history of business computing in Victorian Tertiary Institutions from 1960-1985.</field><field name="creator">Tatnall, Arthur</field><field name="description">Fifty years ago there were no stored-program electronic computers in the world. Even thirty years ago a computer was something that few organisations could afford, and few people could use. Suddenly, in the 1960s and 70s, everything changed and computers began to become accessible. Today* the need for education in Business Computing is generally acknowledged, with each of Victoria's seven universities offering courses of this type. What happened to promote the extremely rapid adoption of such courses is the subject of this thesis.
I will argue that although Computer Science began in Australia's universities of the 1950s, courses in Business Computing commenced in the 1960s due to the requirement of the Commonwealth Government for computing professionals to fulfil its growing administrative needs. The Commonwealth developed Programmer-in-Training courses were later devolved to the new Colleges of Advanced Education. The movement of several key figures from the Commonwealth Public Service to take up positions in Victorian CAEs was significant, and the courses they subsequently developed became the model for many future courses in Business Computing. The reluctance of the universities to become involved in what they saw as little more than vocational training, opened the way for the CAEs to develop this curriculum area.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">study</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">curricula</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Colleges of Advanced Education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051201.145413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel genes in the liver of diabetic psammomys obesus.</field><field name="creator">Southon, Adam</field><field name="description">Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterised by defects in insulin secretion and insulin action and disturbances in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Hepatic insulin resistance contributes to hyperglycemia and also leads to disturbances in fat metabolism in type 2 diabetes. Psammomys obesus is a unique poly genie animal model of type 2 diabetes and obesity, ideally suited for studies examining physiological and genetic aspects of these diseases.
To identify metabolic abnormalities potentially contributing to the obesity and diabetes phenotype in P. obesus, indirect calorimetry was used to characterise whole body energy expenditure and substrate utilisation. Lean-NGT, obese-IGT and obese-diabetic animals were examined in fed and fasted states and following 14 days of dietary energy restriction.
Energy expenditure and fat oxidation were elevated in the obese-IGT and obese-diabetic groups in proportion to body weight. Glucose oxidation was not different between groups. Obese-diabetic P. obesus displayed elevated nocturnal blood glucose levels and fat oxidation. Following 14 days of dietary energy restriction, body weight was reduced and plasma insulin and blood glucose levels were normalised in all groups. Glucose oxidation was reduced and fat oxidation was increased. After 24 hours of fasting, plasma insulin and blood glucose levels were normalised in all groups. Energy expenditure and glucose oxidation were greatly reduced and fat oxidation was increased. Following either dietary energy restriction or fasting, energy expenditure, glucose oxidation and fat oxidation were not different between groups of P. obesus.
Energy expenditure and whole body substrate utilisation in P. obesus was similar to that seen in humans. P. obesus responded normally to short term fasting and dietary energy restriction. Elevated nocturnal fat oxidation rates and plasma glucose levels in obese-diabetic P. obesus may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes in these animals. These studies have further validated P. obesus as an ideal animal model of type 2 diabetes and obesity.
It was hypothesised that many genes in the liver of P. obesus involved in glucose and fat metabolism would be differentially expressed between lean-NGT and obese-diabetic animals. These genes may represent significant factors in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Two gene discovery experiments were conducted using suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) to enrich a cDNA library for differentially expressed genes.
Experiment 1 used cDNA dot blots to screen 576 clones with cDNA derived from lean-NGT and obese-diabetic animals. 6 clones were identified as overexpressed in lean-NGT animals and 6 were overexpressed in obese-diabetic animals. These 12 clones were sequenced and SYBR-Green PCR was used to confirm differential gene expression. 4 genes were overexpressed (&#8805;1.5 fold) in lean-NGT animals and 4 genes were overexpressed (&#8805;1.5 fold) in obese-diabetic animals.
To explore the physiological role of these genes, hepatic gene expression was examined in several physiological conditions. One gene, encoding thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), was confirmed as overexpressed in lean-NGT P. obesus with ad libitum access to food, relative to both obese-IGT and obese-diabetic animals. TBG expression decreased with fasting in all animals. Fasting TBG expression remained greater in lean-NGT animals than obese-IGT and obese-diabetic animals. TBG expression was not significantly affected by dietary energy restriction. TBG is involved in thyroid metabolism and is potentially involved in the regulation of energy expenditure.
Fasting increased hepatic site 1 protease (SIP) expression in lean-NGT animals but was not significantly affected in obese-IGT and obese-diabetic animals. SIP expression was not significantly affected by dietary energy restriction. SIP is involved in the proteolytic processing of steroid response element binding proteins (SREBP). SREBPs are insulin responsive and are known to be involved in lipid metabolism.
Gene expression studies found TBG and SIP were associated with obesity and diabetes. Future research will determine whether TBG and SIP are important in the pathogenesis of these diseases.
Experiment 2 used SSH and cDNA microarray to screen 8064 clones. 223 clones were identified as overexpressed in lean-NGT P. obesus and 274 clones were overexpressed in obese-diabetic P. obesus (p &#8804;0.05). The 9 most significantly differentially expressed clones identified from the microarray screen were sequenced (p &#8804;0.01). 7 novel genes were identified as well as; sulfotransferase related protein and albumin. These 2 genes have not previously been associated with either type 2 diabetes or obesity. It is unclear why hepatic expression of these genes may differ between lean-NGT and obese-diabetic groups of P. obesus. Subsequent studies will explore the potential role of these novel and known genes in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">non insulin</field><field name="subject">genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">Psammomys Obesus</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051201.150429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling intelligent agents for web-based information gathering.</field><field name="creator">Li, Yuefeng</field><field name="description">The recent emergence of intelligent agent technology and advances in information gathering have been the important steps forward in efficiently managing and using the vast amount of information now available on the Web to make informed decisions.

Traditionally it is said that knowledge is power, however, nowadays sufficient, timely, and correct information is power. So gathering relevant information to meet user information needs is the crucial step for making good decisions.
The ideal goal of information gathering is to obtain only the information that users need (no more and no less). However, the volume of information available, diversity formats of information, uncertainties of information, and distributed locations of information (e.g. World Wide Web) hinder the process of gathering the right information to meet the user needs. Specifically, two fundamental issues in regard to efficiency of information gathering are mismatch and overload. The mismatch means some information that meets user needs has not been gathered (or missed out), whereas, the overload means some gathered information is not what users need.
Traditional information retrieval has been developed well in the past twenty years. The introduction of the Web has changed people's perceptions of information retrieval. Usually, the task of information retrieval is considered to have the function of leading the user to those documents that are relevant to his/her information needs. The similar function in information retrieval is to filter out the irrelevant documents (or called information filtering). Research into traditional information retrieval has provided many retrieval models and techniques to represent documents and queries. Nowadays, information is becoming highly distributed, and increasingly difficult to gather. On the other hand, people have found a lot of uncertainties that are contained in the user information needs. These motivate the need for research in agent-based information gathering.
Agent-based information systems arise at this moment. In these kinds of systems, intelligent agents will get commitments from their users and act on the users behalf to gather the required information. They can easily retrieve the relevant information from highly distributed uncertain environments because of their merits of intelligent, autonomy and distribution. The current research for agent-based information gathering systems is divided into single agent gathering systems, and multi-agent gathering systems. In both research areas, there are still open problems to be solved so that agent-based information gathering systems can retrieve the uncertain information more effectively from the highly distributed environments.
The aim of this thesis is to research the theoretical framework for intelligent agents to gather information from the Web. This research integrates the areas of information retrieval and intelligent agents. The specific research areas in this thesis are the development of an information filtering model for single agent systems, and the development of a dynamic belief model for information fusion for multi-agent systems. The research results are also supported by the construction of real information gathering agents (e.g., Job Agent) for the Internet to help users to gather useful information stored in Web sites. In such a framework, information gathering agents have abilities to describe (or learn) the user information needs, and act like users to retrieve, filter, and/or fuse the information.
A rough set based information filtering model is developed to address the problem of overload. The new approach allows users to describe their information needs on user concept spaces rather than on document spaces, and it views a user information need as a rough set over the document space. The rough set decision theory is used to classify new documents into three regions: positive region, boundary region, and negative region. Two experiments are presented to verify this model, and it shows that the rough set based model provides an efficient approach to the overload problem.
In this research, a dynamic belief model for information fusion in multi-agent environments is also developed. This model has a polynomial time complexity, and it has been proven that the fusion results are belief (mass) functions. By using this model, a collection fusion algorithm for information gathering agents is presented. The difficult problem for this research is the case where collections may be used by more than one agent. This algorithm, however, uses the technique of cooperation between agents, and provides a solution for this difficult problem in distributed information retrieval systems.
This thesis presents the solutions to the theoretical problems in agent-based information gathering systems, including information filtering models, agent belief modeling, and collection fusions. It also presents solutions to some of the technical problems in agent-based information systems, such as document classification, the architecture for agent-based information gathering systems, and the decision in multiple agent environments. Such kinds of information gathering agents will gather relevant information from highly distributed uncertain environments.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information gathering</field><field name="subject">information filtering</field><field name="subject">information fusion</field><field name="subject">information retrival</field><field name="subject">intelligent agent</field><field name="subject">agent-based information systems</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051201.151125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of educator adoption of knowledge media.</field><field name="creator">Adam, Ian Peter Stewart</field><field name="description">Human development has occurred against a timeline that has seen the creation of and diffusion of one innovation after another. These innovations range from language to complex computing and information technologies. The latter are assisting with the distribution of information, and extend to the distribution of the human species beyond the planet Earth. From early times, information has been published and mostly for a fee to the publisher. The absorption and use of information has had a high priority in most societies from early times, and has become institutionalised in universities and institutes of technical learning. For most in Western societies, education is now a matter of &#145;lifelong learning&#146;.
Today, we see higher education institutions, worldwide, adapting their organisational structures and operating procedures and forming strategic alliances with communications content providers and carriers as well as with information technology companies. Modern educational institutes seek productivity and efficiency. Many also seek to differentiate themselves from competitors. Technological convergence is often seen by management to be a saviour in many educational organisations. It is hoped that lower capital and recurrent costs can be achieved, and that competitors in an increasingly globalised industry can be held at bay by strategic use of knowledge media (Eisenstadt, 1995) commonly associated with distance education in the campus setting.  Knowledge media set up costs, intellectual property costs and training costs for staff and students are often so high as to make their use not viable for Australian institutes of higher education. Against this backdrop, one might expect greater educator and student use of publisher produced textbooks and digital enhancements to the textbook, particularly those involved in distance education.
A major issue is whether or not the timing of instructor adoption of converging information technology and communications technologies aligns with the wishes of both higher education management and government, and with those who seek commercial gain from the diffusion and adoption of such technologies. Also at issue is whether or not it is possible to explain variance in stated intentions to recommend adoption of new learning technologies in higher education and implementation.  Will there occur educator recommendation for adoption of individual knowledge media such as World Wide Web access to study materials by students? And what will be the form of this tool and others used in higher education?
This thesis reports on more recent changes in the technological environment and seeks to contribute to an understanding of the factors that lead to a willingness, or unwillingness, on the part of higher education instructors, as influencers and content providers, to utilise these technologies. As such, it is a diffusion study which seeks to fill a gap in the literature. Diffusion studies typically focus on predicting adoption based on characteristics of the potential adopter.  Few studies examine the relationship between characteristics of the innovation and adoption.  Nearly all diffusion studies involve what is termed discontinuous innovation (Robertson, 1971). That is, the innovation involves adoptees in a major departure from previous practice. This study seeks to examine the relationship between previous experience of related technologies and adoption or rejection of dynamically continuous innovation. Continuous and dynamically continuous innovations are the most numerous in the real world, yet they are numerically the least scrutinised by way of academic research. Moreover, the three-year longitudinal study of educators in Australian and New Zealand meets important criteria laid down by researchers Tornatzky and Klein (1982) and Rogers (1995), that are often not met by similar studies.  In particular the study examines diffusion as it is unfolding, rather than selectively examining a single innovation and after the fact, thus avoiding a possible pro-innovation bias.
The study examines the situation for both &#145;all educators&#146; and &#145;marketing / management educators&#146; alone in seeking to meet the following aim:
Establish if intended adopters of specific knowledge media have had more experience of other computer-based technologies than have those not intending to adopt said knowledge media.
The analytical phase entails use of factor analysis and discriminant analysis to conclude that it is possible to discriminate adopters of selected knowledge media based on previous use of related technologies. The study does not find any generalised factor that enables such discrimination among educators. Thus the study supports the literature in part, but fails to find generalised factors that enable unambiguous prediction of knowledge media adoption or otherwise among each grouping of educators examined. The implications are that even in the case of related products and services (continuous or dynamically continuous innovation), there is not statistical certainty that prior usage of related products or technologies is related to intentions to use knowledge media in the future. In this regard, the present study might be said to confirm the view that Rogers and Shoemaker's (1971) conceptualisation of perceived innovation characteristics may only apply to discontinuous innovations (Stratton, Lumpkin &amp; Vitell, 1997).
The implications for stakeholders such as higher education management is that when seeking to appoint new educators or existing staff to knowledge media project teams, there is some support for the notion that those who already use World Wide Web based technologies are likely to take these technologies into teaching situations. The same claim cannot be made for computer software use in general, nor Internet use in general.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational innovations</field><field name="subject">educational technology</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051201.152331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Presbyterian ethos and environment in the novels of John Buchan: A religious and historical study.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Edwin Roughton</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to establish, from a historical and religious perspective, that the Presbyterian ethos and environment in which John Buchan was reared was the predominating influence in the writing of his novels.
Presbyterianism was not the only influence on Buchan that determined the character of his stories. Buchan was by temperament a romantic, and this had considerable influence on his literature. His novels are romances, peopled by romantic figures who pursue romantic adventures. There are the signs of Buchan's romantic nature in the contents of the novels: creative imagination, sensitivity to nature, and expectations of the intrusion of other worlds, with destiny-determining events to follow. But Buchan had also an acquired classicism. His studies at Glasgow and Oxford Universities brought him in touch with a whole range of the master-pieces of classical literature, especially the works of Plato and Virgil. This discipline gave him clarity and conciseness in style, and balanced the romantic element in him, keeping his work within the bounds of reason.
At the heart of Buchan's life and work, however, was his deeply religious nature and this, while influenced by romanticism and classicism, was the dominant force behind his work. Buchan did not accept in its entirety the Presbyterian doctrine conveyed to him by his father and his Church. He was moderate by temperament and shrank from excesses in religious matters, and, being a romantic, he shied away from any fixed creeds. He did embrace the fundamentals of Christianity, however, which he learned from his father and his Church, even if he did put aside the Rev. John's orthodox Calvinism. The basic Christianity which underlies all Buchan's novels has the stamp of Presbyterianism upon it, and that stamp is evident in his characters and their adventures.
The expression of Christianity which Buchan embraced was the Christian Platonism of seventeenth century theologians, who taught and preached at Cambridge University, They gave prominence to the place of reason and conscience in man's search for God, They believed that reason and conscience were the &#145;candle of the Lord&#146; which was existed every one. It was their conviction that, if that light was followed, it would lead men and women to God. They were against superstition and fanaticism in religion, against all forms of persecution for religious beliefs, and insisted that God could only be known by renouncing evil and setting oneself to live according to God&#146;s will. This teaching Buchan received, but the stamp of his Presbyterianism was not obliterated.
The basic doctrines which arose from his father's Presbyterianism and are
to be found in Buchan's novels are as follows:
a. the fear (or awe) of God, as life's basic religious attitude;
b. the Providence of God as the ultimate determinative force in the
outcome of events;
c. the reality, malignity and universality of evil which must be forcefully
and constantly resisted;
d. the dignity of human beings in bearing God's image;
e. the conviction that life has meaning and that its ultimate goal,
therefore, is a spiritual one - as opposed to the accumulation of wealth, the achieving of recognition from society, and the gaining access to
power;
f. the necessity of challenge in life for growth and fulfilment, and the
importance of fortitude in successfully meeting such challenge;
g. the belief that, in the purpose of God, the weak confound the strong.
These emphases of Presbyterianism are to be found in all Buchan's novels, to a greater or lesser degree. All his characters are serious people, with a moral purpose in life. Like the pilgrims of the Bible, they seek a country: true fulfilment. This quest becomes more spiritual and more dearly defined as Buchan grows in age and maturity. The progress is to be traced from his early novels, where fulfilment is sought in honour and self-approving competence, as advocated by classicism; to the novels of his middle years, where fulfilment is sought in adventures suggested by romanticism. In his final novel Sick Heart River. Buchan appears to have moved somewhat from his earlier classicism and his romanticism as the road to fulfilment.
In this novel, Buchan expresses what, for him, is ultimate fulfilment: a conversion to God that produces self-sacrificing love for others. The terminally-ill Edward Leithen sets out on a romantic adventure that will enable him to die with dignity, and so, in classic style, justify his existence. He has a belief in God, but in a God who is almighty, distant and largely irrelevant to Leithen's life. In the frozen North of Canada, where he expects to find his meagre beliefs in God's absolute power confirmed by the icy majesty of mountain and plain, he finds instead God's mercy and it melts his heart. In a Christ-like way, he brings life to others through his death, believing that, through death, he will find life.
 
There is sufficient evidence to give plausibility to the view that Buchan is describing in Leithen his own pilgrimage. If so, it means that Buchan found his way back to the fundamental experience of the Christian life, conversion, so strongly emphasised in his orthodox Presbyterianism home and Church. However, Buchan reaches this conclusion in a Christian Platonist way, through the natural world, rather than through the more orthodox pathway of Scripture.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">John Buchan</field><field name="subject">presbyterian</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">polictics</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Plato</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051201.153016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies with voltammetric microdisk electrodes.</field><field name="creator">Luscombe, Darryl L.</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">voltammetry</field><field name="subject">electrodes</field><field name="subject">microdisk</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051201.153433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liberty in key works of John Locke and John Stuart Mill.</field><field name="creator">Wright, John Samuel Flectcher</field><field name="description">The ideas of liberty presented in the important works of John Locke and John Stuart Mill, The Second Treatise of Government (1689) and On Liberty (1859), are often viewed as belonging to the same conceptual tradition, that of English liberalism. This thesis is an articulation of the diversity between the theories of liberty expressed by Locke and Mill in the Second Treatise and On liberty. \ am aiming to provide a corrective to the tendency to ignore or to gloss over very significant differences between the two men. The work concentrates on the philosophical aspects of each theory of liberty, arguing that they differ in four respects. These are; definitions of liberty; justifications of liberty; how much liberty and for whom they recommend it, and finally, who they believe threatens liberty and how this threat is to be curbed. It is the purpose of this thesis to show that in terms of these areas Locke and Mill are pursuing different ends. I conclude that Locke and Mill present strikingly different theories of liberty and cannot be thought of as belonging to the one conceptual tradition in terms of the definition, the justification, the prescription and the threat to liberty.

Specification languages such as Z permit the precise and unambiguous modelling of system properties and behaviour. However some system problems, particularly those drawn from the information systems problem domain, may be difficult to model in crisp or precise terms. It may also be desirable that formal modelling should commence as early as possible, even when our understanding of parts of the problem domain is only approximate. This thesis suggests fuzzy set theory as a possible representation scheme for this imprecision or approximation. A fuzzy logic toolkit that defines the operators, measures and modifiers necessary for the manipulation of fuzzy sets and relations is developed. The toolkit contains a detailed set of laws that demonstrate the properties of the definitions when applied to partial set membership. It also provides a set of laws that establishes an isomorphism between the toolkit notation and that of conventional Z when applied to boolean sets and relations. The thesis also illustrates how the fuzzy logic toolkit can be applied in the problem domains of interest. Several examples are presented and discussed including the representation of imprecise concepts as fuzzy sets and relations, system requirements as a series of linguistically quantified propositions, the modelling of conflict and agreement in terms of fuzzy sets and the partial specification of a fuzzy expert system.

The efficient and transparent management of parallelism within the COW environment requires enhanced methods of process instantiation, mapping of parallel process to workstations, maintenance of process relationships, process communication facilities, and process coordination mechanisms.
The aim of this research is to synthesise, design, develop and experimentally study a system capable of efficiently and transparently managing SPMD parallelism on a COW. This system should both improve the performance of SPMD based parallel programs and relieve the programmer from the involvement into parallelism management in order to allow them to concentrate on application programming. It is also the aim of this research to show that such a system, to achieve these objectives, is best achieved by adding new special services and exploiting the existing services of a client/server and microkernel based distributed operating system. To achieve these goals the research methods of the experimental computer science should be employed.
In order to specify the scope of this project, this work investigated the issues related to parallel processing on COWs and surveyed a number of relevant systems including PVM, NOW and MOSIX. It was shown that although the MOSIX system provide a number of good services related to parallelism management, none of the system forms a complete solution. The problems identified with these systems include: instantiation services that are not suited to parallel processing; duplication of services between the parallelism management environment and the operating system; and poor levels of transparency.
A high performance and transparent system capable of managing the execution of SPMD parallel applications was synthesised and the specific services of process instantiation, process mapping and process interaction detailed. The process instantiation service designed here provides the capability to instantiate parallel processes using either creation or duplication methods and also supports multiple and group based instantiation which is specifically design for SPMD parallel processing. The process mapping service provides the combination of process allocation and dynamic load balancing to ensure the load of a COW remains balanced not only at the time a parallel program is initialised but also during the execution of the program. The process interaction service guarantees to maintain transparently process relationships, communications and coordination services between parallel processes regardless of their location within the COW. The combination of these services provides an original architecture and organisation of a system that is capable of fully managing the execution of SPMD parallel applications on a COW.
A logical design of a parallelism management system was developed derived from the synthesised system and was shown that it should ideally be based on a distributed operating system employing the client server model. The client/server based distributed operating system provides the level of transparency, modularity and flexibility necessary for a complete parallelism management system. The services identified in the synthesised system have been mapped to a set of server processes including: Process Instantiation Server providing advanced multiple and group based process creation and duplication; Process Mapping Server combining load collection, process allocation and dynamic load balancing services; and Process Interaction Server providing transparent interprocess communication and coordination. A Process Migration Server was also identified as vital to support both the instantiation and mapping servers.
The RHODOS client/server and microkernel based distributed operating system was selected to carry out research into the detailed design and to be used for the implementation this parallelism management system. RHODOS was enhanced to provide the required servers and resulted in the development of the REX Manager, Global Scheduler and Process Migration Manager to provide the services of process instantiation, mapping and migration, respectively. The process interaction services
were already provided within RHODOS and only required some extensions to the existing Process Manager and IPC Managers.
Through a variety of experiments it was shown that when this system was used to support the execution of SPMD parallel applications the overall execution times were improved, especially when multiple and group based instantiation services are employed. The RHODOS PMS was also shown to greatly reduce the programming burden experienced by users when writing SPMD parallel applications by providing a small set of powerful primitives specially designed to support parallel processing. The system was also shown to be applicable and has been used in a variety of other research areas such as Distributed Shared Memory, Parallelising Compilers and assisting the port of PVM to the RHODOS system.
The RHODOS Parallelism Management System (PMS) provides a unique and creative solution to the problem of transparently and efficiently controlling the execution of SPMD parallel applications on COWs. Combining advanced services such as multiple and group based process creation and duplication; combined process allocation and dynamic load balancing; and complete COW wide transparency produces a totally new system that addresses many of the problems not addressed in other systems.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer networks</field><field name="subject">parallel processing</field><field name="subject">workstations</field><field name="subject">MOSIX systms</field><field name="subject">PVM</field><field name="subject">NOW</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051202.083729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public libraries in Ballarat: 1851-1900.</field><field name="creator">Mansfield, Peter Gerald</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the development of the Ballarat East Free Library (1859), the Ballarat Mechanics&#146; Institute Library (1859) and the City of Ballaarat Free Library (1878) within the broader context of public librarianship in Victoria between 1851-1900.
Mechanics&#146; Institute libraries and free libraries represent the major derivatives of a nineteenth-century library model that emphasised the pursuit of lifelong learning, private reading and the enjoyment of genteel recreational facilities.  The circumstances that led to the formation of an Institute and a free library in Ballarat in, 1,859 provide a unique opportunity to analyse the public library model for two reasons. These libraries were established in a remarkable goldfield city that enjoyed a number of economic and cultural advantages and secondly, the Ballarat Mechanics&#146; Institute Library and the Ballarat East Free Library experienced such spectacular growth that by 1880 they were two of the largest public libraries in Australia.
However, it is argued that this growth cycle could not be sustained due to a combination of factors including low membership levels, limited funding for recurrent expenditure purposes, and heightened dissatisfaction with the book collections. Libraries began to stagnate in the late-1880s and the magnitude of this collapse in Ballarat, and throughout the colony, was subsequently confirmed with the publication of a national survey of Australian libraries in 1935. The &#145;Munn-Pitt&#146; report found that public libraries had provided a better service in 1880 than at any other time in the next six decades.
Four conclusions are drawn in this comparative analysis of the Ballarat Mechanics&#146; Institute Library, the Ballarat East Free Library, and to a lesser extent, the City of Ballaarat Free Library, between 1851-1900. Firstly, is it shown that the literature places considerable emphasis on the formation of public libraries but is far less critical of the long-term viability of the public library model as it evolved in Ballarat and throughout the colony in the nineteenth century. Secondly, whilst Ballarat and its library committees benefited from the city's prosperity and the entrepreneurial zeal of its pioneers, these same library committees were unable to overcome the structural flaws in the public library model or to dispel the widespread belief that libraries were elitist organisations. As a consequence, membership of the major libraries in Ballarat never exceeded 4% of the total population. Thirdly, it is acknowledged that an absence of records relating to book borrowing habits by individuals limits is a limiting factor, but this problem has been addressed, in part, by undertaking a comparative analysis of collection development policies, invoices, lists of popular authors and books, public comment and the book borrowing patterns of a number of comparable libraries in central Victoria. These resources provide a number of insights into the reading habits of library patrons in Ballarat in the late-nineteenth century.
Finally, this thesis focuses on the management policies and practices of each library committee in Ballarat in order to move beyond the traditional explanation for the demise of nineteenth-century libraries and to propose an alternative explanation for the stagnation of public libraries in Ballarat in the mid-1880s. The traditional explanation for the demise of colonial libraries was the sudden reduction in government funding in the 1890s, whereas this thesis argues that a combination of factors, including the unresolved tensions with regard to libraries collection development policies, committee and municipal rivalry, and increasing conservatism, had already damaged the credibility of Ballarat&#146;s libraries by the mid-1880s. It is argued that the intense rivalry between library committees resulted in an unnecessary duplication of services and an inadequate membership base. It is also argued that the increasingly conservative, un-cooperative and uninviting attitudes of these library committees discouraged patronage and as a direct consequence, membership and daily visitor rates of the free and Institute libraries in Ballarat plummeted by 80% between 1880-1900.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ballarat</field><field name="subject">Ballaarat</field><field name="subject">Mechanics institutes</field><field name="subject">public libraries</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051202.084508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How deinstitutionalisation and the current public mental health system affects individuals with schizophrenia: Four case reports.</field><field name="creator">Hardman, Lisa</field><field name="description">The professional component of this thesis focuses on how deinstitutionalisation and the current public mental health system have affected individuals with schizophrenia.

Four case studies are then provided in order to explore how deinstitutionalisation and the current mental health system have affected individuals with schizophrenia. The names and identifying characteristics of these clients and their families have been modified to ensure anonymity.

Past researchers have found that a variety of individual factors (age, gender, gender role, and past experiences of sexual harassment), and organisational factors (gender ratio, sexual harassment policies and the role of employers), correlate with the incidence of sexually harassing behaviours. Two studies presented in this thesis extend this research and were designed to investigate how these factors relate to workers&#146; attitudes towards and perceptions of sexual harassment. Study one investigated 176 workers from a large, white-collar organisation. Study two sampled 75 workers from a smaller, blue-collar organisation. By comparing two different workplaces the effect of the organisational climate was investigated. Individuals from Study two experienced more sexual harassment, were more tolerant of sexual harassment and perceived less behaviour as sexual harassment compared with individuals from Study one. The organisational context was found to affect the way in which organisational and individual factors related to workers' attitudes to and their experiences of sexual harassment. However, the factors that influenced workers&#146; perceptions of sexual harassment were stable across both studies. Although workers&#146; attitudes to and their perceptions of sexual harassment were significantly correlated, they were influenced by different factors. Overall, workers&#146; perceptions of sexual harassment were influenced by their attitudes, the behavioural context, and the gender of the victim and perpetrator. In contrast, attitudes to sexual harassment appeared to be more strongly influenced by individual factors, such as age, gender, gender role, past experiences of sexual  harassment,  and perceptions of management&#146;s tolerance of sexual harassment. The broader implications of these findings are discussed and recommendations for future research are suggested.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sexual harassment</field><field name="subject">blue collar workers</field><field name="subject">white collar workers</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051202.090143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use and cost effectiveness of computer based training in the insurance industry.</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Thomas Gordon</field><field name="description">Training is essential to the growth and economic well-being of a nation.

This is slightly higher in the Finance industry at a little over 89%. On the job training is undertaken by 82% of employers and off the job training is used by 47% of employers. In 80% of the off the job cases these courses were conducted in a conventional manner using an instructor. The remaining 20% of cases were either self paced (14%) or instructor based (6%). These latter cases could involve Computer Based Training (CBT).
The report, referred to in the last paragraph, also indicates that a significant aspect of business in Australia is that 95% of businesses have less than 20 staff. This poses significant problems in that the ability to deliver effective training is limited. With businesses as small as these their size does not permit them to carry specialist training personnel so this role falls to the senior staff. These people already have a full workload and their ability to be able to take on training duties is limited. In addition these people were employed for their technical skills, not training. It may be that their ability to fill the role of a trainer is not good and as a result the training may not be very effective. In addition, small business has difficulty in releasing staff for training, The difficulties faced by small business were recognised by the Australian National Training Authority in their 1995 report which indicated that there was a need to develop a &#145;training culture&#146; among small business employers. The authority made a commitment to provide flexible delivery strategies. This includes Computer Based Training (CBT). CBT has existed since the 1970&#146;s. It came on to the scene with a flourish and tended to provide &#145;page turning&#146; programs or &#145;drill and practice programs&#146;. In limited areas this form of training became popular but its popularity waned in the 80&#146;s. With the advent of better graphical displays, larger and faster memory, and improved programs in the 1990&#146;s the quality of CBT today is superior to those offered in the 70&#146;s and has greater appeal. Today, still photographs and video clips can be displayed and made interactive. Because of this CBT is making a comeback and starting to have a greater impact.
The insurance industry covers a wide range of companies in Australia, these companies vary in size from companies with employees in the thousands to companies with less than five staff. While the needs of the employees of each are similar the ability of these companies to deliver the training varies significantly.
Any training can be divided into two parts. Internal or on the job training and external. External training deals with those aspects that concern the industry as a whole whereas internal training affects the individual company. Internal training would deal with matters like company procedures, company products and the like. External training deals with matters such as legislation, products generally, and the like. In the insurance industry the major problem arises with the small companies. Insurance companies would tend to be large in size and able to cover their training costs but the insurance brokers who would make up, numerically, the major number of companies would have a significant number of companies that fall into the 20 staffer less category. In fact many would have a staff of less than 5. While CBT can benefit all companies it is these small companies that could benefit from it the most.
This thesis examines:
&#149;        The place of CBT in training, its cost and effectiveness.
 
&#149;         The incidence of CBT in the insurance industry and how the industry determines its effectiveness.

This series of studies was undertaken to examine the adrenergic regulation of carbohydrate metabolism during exercise. Recreationally active males were tested during moderate to intense exercise on a stationary cycle ergometer. Venous and arterial plasma obtained from indwelling catheters was analysed for hormonal and metabolite responses, and hepatic glucose production and glucose uptake were measured using the tracer-dilution method with stable isotopes. Muscle samples were obtained by the needle biopsy technique to examine muscle glycogen utilisation and the flux of related muscle metabolites using enzymatic, fluorometric and radioisotopic techniques.
2.  During moderate exercise adrenaline infusion induced a marked hyperglycemia and this was due to reduced glucose uptake rather than enhanced hepatic glucose production. The reduction in glucose uptake was most likely mediated by a decrease in glucose phosphorylation, as indicated by the accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate with adrenaline infusion.
3.  The hyperglycemic response to intense exercise was prevented by the administration of &#945;- and &#946;-adrenergic antagonists. Adrenergic blockade was without effect on hepatic glucose production whereas glucose uptake was enhanced when compared with control subjects. These data support the notion that adrenergic mechanisms are more important in restraining glucose uptake than enhancing hepatic glucose production during intense exercise. Other glucoregulatory factors are responsible for the increase in glucose production during intense exercise.

From a critical perspective, supervision is viewed as a political and ideological process enacted through asymmetrical relations and structures of communication. It is underpinned by a discourse of technocratic rationality and control Clinical supervision, a currently popular model of teacher supervision, has (despite its emancipatory origins) been accommodated by the dominant ideology and is employed as a hegemonic mechanism of evaluation, control and even dismissal of teachers.
However, historical analysis reveals that teachers have contested and resisted authoritarianism and centralized control in favour of developing more democratic and participatory forms of professional development. In these moves can be found a rationale for a reconstruction of the theory and practice of clinical supervision around the concepts of symmetrical communication and critical pedagogy. The researcher engaged in a self-reflective study with a group of supervisors and teachers in N.S.W. schools to explore the possibilities and limitations of a critical and counter-hegemonic practice of supervision.
The outcomes, in the form of three case studies, are analysed in terms of a dialectic of reconstruction and maintenance of the status quo. The evidence reveals that some of the research participants sought to reconstruct their supervisory relationships in ways which challenged the bureaucratic structures of their workplace. Others, however, rejected the emancipatory possibilities and resolved to maintain their traditional hierarchical relationship.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school supervision</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">clinical supervision</field><field name="subject">supervision</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051208.090305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenomenological inquiry into the experience of web project managers.</field><field name="creator">Sarker, Pradipta K</field><field name="description">The advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web has been instrumental in bringing about the growth in the implementation of web-based information systems (WBIS). Such systems are designed with the aim of improving productivity, data accuracy, and the reduction of paperwork and administrative overheads. Moreover, unlike their conventional non-web-based predecessors, the WBIS are commonly aimed at users who are casual and untrained, geographically distributed and non-homogenous. The dissemination of WBIS necessitates additional infrastructure support in the form of a security system, workflow and transaction management, and web administration.
WBIS are commonly developed using an evolutionary approach, whereby the version of the application, acquired from the vendor, is first deployed as a pilot, in order to gather feedback from the target users before the evolutionary cycles commence. While a number of web development methodologies have been proposed by existing research, there is a dearth of empirical evidence that elucidates the experiences of project initiators in pursuing the evolution of web services, a process that undoubtedly involves dealing with stakeholder issues.
This research project presents a phenomenological investigation of the experiences of project managers with the implementation of web-based employee service systems (ESS), a domain that has witnessed a sharp growth in Australia in recent times. However, the project managers&#146; rich, multidimensional account of their experiences with the implementation of ESS revealed the social obstacles and fragility of intra-organizational relationships that demanded a cautious and tactful approach. Thus, the study provides a socio-organizational perspective to web projects in contrast to the functionalist paradigm of current web development methodologies. The research also confirms that consideration of the concerns of stakeholders by project managers is crucial to the successive cycles of ESS evolution.  Project managers address stakeholder concerns by pursuing actions that are aimed at encouraging ESS usage, but at the same time, such actions can have consequences necessitating subsequent iterations of system enhancement and improvement. Finally, the research also discovered that despite the different socio-political climate prevalent in various organizations, in which ESS are being implemented, the experiences of project managers in dealing with stakeholder concerns can be captured and independently confirmed in terms of their perceived relevance and usefulness in problem-solving within the application domain.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">web site development</field><field name="subject">internet programming</field><field name="subject">web managers</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051208.091736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of attachment theory in chronic medical illness: A clinical investigation.</field><field name="creator">Leas, Loraine</field><field name="description">Recently, researchers have begun to examine the impact of attachment on coping with a medical illness. It is hypothesised that a patient's responses to unusual or distressing physical symptoms and participation in the patient-clinician relationship can be understood by examining the nature of their attachments. Theoretical links between attachment style and affect regulation suggest that &#145;internal working models&#146; developed in childhood may have implications, not only for the quality of close relationships, such as romantic love, but also for other significant interactions. In the domain of physical illness, patient-clinician interactions represent such a significant relationship. It is proposed that the attachment behaviour of the patient to the clinician in the context of chronic medical illness may impact on medical illness behaviour and illness outcome. This clinical portfolio reviews the literature on attachment theory, health behaviour and the implications of the patient-clinician relationship in the context of a chronic medical illness. Four case studies of different types of chronic medical illness were examined in relation to attachment theory. The cases included: Jenny, a 10 year-old girl with polycystic kidney disease; Angela, a 13 year-old girl with recurrent urinary tract infections; Aarron, a 36 year-old man with Human Immunodeficiency Virus; and Andrew, a 49 year-old man with multiple medical illnesses. It was concluded that attachment theory is a useful conceptual framework for informing clinical formulation and explaining the patient-clinician interaction among individuals with a chronic medical illness.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health behaviour</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">schizophrenics</field><field name="subject">coronary disease</field><field name="subject">attachment behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051208.092522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiovascular health behaviours and health needs among people with psychiatric disabilities.</field><field name="creator">Leas, Loranie</field><field name="description">Recent research in Australia has found that people with a mental illness experience higher mortality rates from preventable illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes compared to the general population. Lifestyle and other behavioural factors contribute significantly to these illnesses. Lifestyle behaviours that affect these illnesses include lack of physical activity, consumption of a poor diet and cigarette smoking. Research on the influence of these factors has been mainly directed towards the mainstream population in Australia. Consequently, there remains limited understanding of health behaviours among individuals with psychiatric disabilities, their health needs, or factors influencing their participation in protective health behaviours. This thesis presents findings from two studies. Study 1 evaluated the utility of the main components of Roger&#146;s (1983) Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to explain health behaviours among people with a mental illness. A clinical population of individuals with schizophrenia (N=83), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (N=70) and individuals without a mental illness (N=147) participated in the study. Respondents provided information on intentions and self-reported behaviour of engaging in physical activity, following a low-fat diet, and stopping smoking. Study 2 investigated the health care service needs of people with psychiatric disabilities (N=20). Results indicated that the prevalence of overweight, cigarette smoking and a sedentary lifestyle were significantly greater among people with a mental illness compared to that reported for individuals without a mental illness. Major predictors of the lack of intentions to adopt health behaviours among individuals with schizophrenia and MDD were high levels of fear of cardiovascular disease, lack of knowledge of correct dietary principles, lower self-efficacy, a limited social support network and a high level of psychiatric symptoms. In addition, findings demonstrated that psychiatric patients are disproportionately higher users of medical services, but they are under-users of preventive medical care services. These differences are primarily due to a lack of focus on preventive health, feelings of disempowerment and lower satisfaction of patient-doctor relationships. Implications of these results are discussed in terms of designing education and preventive programs for individuals with schizophrenia and MDD.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">health behavior</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">schizophrenics</field><field name="subject">coronary disease</field><field name="subject">attachement behavior</field><field name="subject">protection motivation theory</field><field name="subject">pmt</field><field name="subject">major depressive disorder</field><field name="subject">MDD</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051208.095530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Longitudinal evaluation of a risk-factor model for adolescent suicidality.</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Kathryn Ann</field><field name="description">This research developed two best-fitting structural equation models of risk factors for adolescent depression and suicidality: a core model, which included parenting factors, gender, depression, and suicidality, and an extended model, which also encompassed personality traits (Introversion and Impulsivity) and mood factors (Anxiety and Anger). Further, this research investigated the consistency of model fit across time (Le., 1 month &amp; 12 months) and samples, and explored the effectiveness of the ReachOut! Internet site as a psychoeducational prevention strategy for adolescent depression and suicidality. Gender, age, and location differences were also explored.
Participants were 185 Year-9 students and 93 Year-10 students aged 14 - 16 years, from seven secondary schools in regional and rural Victoria. Students were given a survey which included the Parental Bonding Instrument (Parker, Tupling, &amp; Brown, 1979), the Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory (Millon, Green, &amp; Meagher, 1982), the Profile of Mood States Inventory (McNair &amp; Lorr, 1964), items on suicidal behaviour including some questions from the Revised Adolescent Suicide Questionnaire (Pearce &amp; Martin, 1994), and questions on loss and general demographics.
Results supported an indirect model of risk factors, with family factors directly influencing personality factors, which in turn influenced mood factors, including depression, which then influenced suicidality. At the theoretical level, results supported Attachment Theory (Bowlby, 1969), demonstrating that perceived parenting styles that are warm and not overly controlling are more conducive to an adolescent's emotional well-being than are parenting styles that are cold and controlling. Further, results supported Millon's theory of personality (1981), demonstrating that parenting style influences a child's personality.
Short-term intervention effects from the internet site were a decrease in Introversion for the full sample, and decreased Inhibition and Suicidality for a high-risk subgroup. Long-term age effects were decreased Inhibition and increased Anxiety for the fall sample. There was also a probable intervention effect for Depression for the high-risk subgroup. No location differences for the risk factors were found between regional and rural areas.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teenagers</field><field name="subject">suicide</field><field name="subject">adolescent suicide</field><field name="subject">suicidal behavior</field><field name="subject">attachment theory</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051208.100703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The response of the child with autism to preferred prosody during instruction.</field><field name="creator">Lamers, Kirsty A</field><field name="description">It has been found that incorporating preferences leads to improvements in target skills for children with autism. No studies have been found, however, that assess the preferences of children for prosody of teacher instruction. Prosody has been defined by fluency of speech, modification of pitch and stress of syllables. This research assessed the preference for, and effectiveness of, prosody of instruction by teachers of children with autism. The preferences of children with autism for monotone, conversational and enthusiastic voice prosodies were assessed.  The children's teachers made recording of their own voice reading a story passage in the three selected prosodies. The children with autism were requested to listen to these recordings and select a preferred prosody over thirty three trials. Chi square analyses were conducted to determine the significant preferences from these trials. The selections of prosody of the children with autism were compared with the selections of typical children of the same age.  Significant preferences were found for three children with autism and seven typical children.  The three children with autism with significant preferences were observed in their classrooms.  Teachers were cued with flashcards to use the different prosodies and the children's responses were recorded. An additional twenty instructions were recorded in which the teachers were not given a cue for voice prosody Chi square and Fisher's exact tests indicated that children's preferences did not influence their responses to prosody during classroom instruction. In other words the response in class was not related to prosody preference. Overall children were more likely to not respond to the monotone prosody. The enthusiastic and conversational prosodies were equally effective. Therefore it was concluded that continued and varied use of enthusiastic and conversational prosodies during classroom instruction would be effective for children with autism. It was recommended that future research focus on evaluating the effectiveness of variety of prosody for children with autism.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">autistic children</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051208.101225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vertigo: Riccardo Formosa's composition technique.</field><field name="creator">Barkl, Michael Laurence Gordon</field><field name="description">Riccardo Formosa has been identified as being an important and widely recognised young Australian composer. Formosa's possession of a sophisticated composition technique is central to his approach to composition and to his reputation among contemporary composers.
Vertigo: Riccardo Formosa's Composition Technique aims to define the composition technique employed by Formosa. It does so by analysing the works from a number of clearly defined perspectives.
The study proceeds firstly through a description of the works as a whole and their relationship to the composer&#146;s personal history. Secondly, the note-to-note operations Formosa has employed are reassembled through a detailed examination of the scores. Thirdly, an assessment is made of the function of the various techniques within the musical texture. Lastly, a number of comparisons are made between Formosa&#146;s work and the work of his compositional models.
The study concludes that Formosa&#146;s works show evidence of a composition technique operating effectively on different levels. The note-to-note processes, simple in themselves, are multiplied to form a complex counterpoint. On both the note-to-note level and the relationship between larger sections of the works, the controlling factor was found to be one of &#145;binary expression&#146; in the form of symmetry or complementarity, a compositional aesthetic also held by Formosa's teacher.

Like hyperbolic mappings, they involve a splitting into stable and unstable spaces, but a slight leakage from the strict invariance of the spaces is possible and the unstable subspaces are assumed to be finite dimensional.
Bi-shadowing is a combination of the concepts of shadowing and inverse shadowing and is usually used to compare pseudo-trajectories calculated by a computer with the true trajectories. In this thesis, the concept of bi-shadowing in a Banach space is defined and proved for semi-hyperbolic dynamical systems generated by Lipschitz mappings. As an application to the concept of bishadowing, linear delay differential equations are shown to be bi-shadowing with respect to pseudo-trajectories generated by nonlinear small perturbations of the linear delay equation. This shows robustness of solutions of the linear delay equation with respect to small nonlinear perturbations.
Complicated dynamical behaviour is often a consequence of the expansivity of a dynamical system. Semi-hyperbolic dynamical systems generated by Lipschitz mappings on a Banach space are shown to be exponentially expansive, and explicit rates of expansion are determined. The result is applied to a nonsmooth noninvertible system generated by delay differential equation.
It is shown that semi-hyperbolic mappings are locally &#966;-contracting, where -0 is the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness, and that a linear operator is semi-hyperbolic if and only if it is &#966;-contracting and has no spectral values on the unit circle. The definition of &#966;-bi-shadowing is given and it is shown that semi-hyperbolic mappings in Banach spaces are &#966;-bi-shadowing with respect to locally condensing continuous comparison mappings.  The result is applied to linear delay differential equations of neutral type with nonsmooth perturbations.
Finally, it is shown that a small delay perturbation of an ordinary differential equation with a homoclinic trajectory is &#145;chaotic&#146;.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Banach spaces</field><field name="subject">differentiable dynamical systems</field><field name="subject">chaotic behavior in systems</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051208.110247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anycast services and its applications.</field><field name="creator">Yu, Shui</field><field name="description">Anycast in next generation Internet Protocol is a hot topic in the research of computer networks. It has promising potentials and also many challenges, such as architecture, routing, Quality-of-Service, anycast in ad hoc networks, application-layer anycast, etc. In this thesis, we tackle some important topics among them. The thesis at first presents an introduction about anycast, followed by the related work. Then, as our major contributions, a number of challenging issues are addressed in the following chapters. We tackled the anycast routing problem by proposing a requirement based probing algorithm at application layer for anycast routing. Compared with the existing periodical based probing routing algorithm, the proposed routing algorithm improves the performance in terms of delay. We addressed the reliable service problem by the design of a twin server model for the anycast servers, providing a transparent and reliable service for all anycast queries. We addressed the load balance problem of anycast servers by proposing new job deviation strategies, to provide a similar Quality-of-Service to all clients of anycast servers. We applied the mesh routing methodology in the anycast routing in ad hoc networking environment, which provides a reliable routing service and uses much less network resources. We combined the anycast protocol and the multicast protocol to provide a bidirectional service, and applied the service to Web-based database applications, achieving a better query efficiency and data synchronization. Finally, we proposed a new Internet based service, minicast, as the combination of the anycast and multicast protocols. Such a service has potential applications in information retrieval, parallel computing, cache queries, etc. We show that the minicast service consumes less network resources while providing the same services.

The thesis consists of two parts: a memoir The Strangeness of Freedom, and an exegesis. Each is intended to stand alone, but also to complement the other. In the memoir I draw on my personal recollections of my family's migrations across five countries (Czechoslovakia, West Germany, USA and Australia) and into three languages (Czech, German and English) in order to convey my particular experience of language migration.
In the exegesis I analyse several memoirs written by other language migrants and examine what impact they believe migrating into a new language and culture had on their own Self-identity. I draw on postmodern and psychoanalytic theory to explore the nature of Self-Identity formation and why migrants, as well as non-migrants might experience a change in their Self-identity during the course of their lives. I attempt to tease out to what extent the change in Self-identity is a universal experience that results from living across time and moving from a known past into an unknown future, regardless of whether one physically migrates or not.
I found that while language-migrants tend to describe a more intense disruption of their Self-Identity, non-migrants also experience such a disruption in their sense of Self, simply by living in a rapidly changing world. I propose that while changing locations and languages clearly disrupts the continuity we presume life entails, it is in fact the passage of time that distances us from our known past, including our familiar Self, even if we never physically or linguistically migrate.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">linguistic change</field><field name="subject">immigrants</field><field name="subject">cultural assimilation</field><field name="subject">ethnopsychology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051208.113428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship of nutritional and metabolic factors to non-invasive, indices of macrovascular disease in diabetes.</field><field name="creator">Lo, Che Sam</field><field name="description">Factors which may account for the high frequency of macrovascular disease in diabetics are age, sex, cigarette smoking, hypertension, obesity, lack of exercise, diet, hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaeroia, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, low HDL-cholesterol concentration, elevated free fatty acid concentration and enhanced platelet aggregation. Twenty seven (13 men and 14 women) non-insulin-dependent diabetics and thirty eight age, height and weight matched healthy subjects (10 men and 28 women) were studied. None of the subjects were smokers, or hypertensive. No subject had any clinical evidence of peripheral arterial disease, coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease. All had apparently normal peripheral pulses and normal ankle/arm blood pressure indices. Methods for determining arterial compliance in the segment between the left subclavian artery and each common femoral artery, and proximal resistance at the common femoral artery and posterior tibial artery, have been reviewed and developed. An appropriate food intake methodology for deriving food indices from food records was developed. Biochemical determinants have been made of glucose tolerance, glycosylated haemoglobin, serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, plasma free fatty acid and insulin. A significant decrease in the arterial compliance, and a significant increase in the arterial proximal resistance at the common femoral artery and posterior tibial artery in non-insulin-dependent diabetics, compared with their healthy controls, have been found. Significant negative correlation between arterial compliance and proximal resistance and, a significant positive correlation between the arterial proximal resistance of common femoral artery and posterior tibial artery were found. Differences between control (healthy subjects) and non-insulin-dependent diabetic groups indicate that preclinical peripheral arterial disease can be recognised even in mild diabetics by non-invasive measurement of arterial compliance or proximal resistance. There were significant and negative correlations between arterial compliance and each of blood glucose, blood glycosylated haemoglobin (HbAlC), plasma free fatty acid and plasma insulin concentration. There were significant and positive correlations between arterial proximal resistance of common femoral artery and posterior tibial artery and each of blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin and plasma free fatty acid concentration. Multivariate analysis to examine each of the biochemical factors Including blood glucose, blood glycosylated haemoglobin (HbAlC), plasma free fatty acid, plasma Insulin and lipids, showed that the factor which most influenced the arterial compliance and the proximal resistance of posterior tibial artery was the glucose level in the fasting state or the glucose response after a glucose load. In addition, the factors which most influenced proximal resistance of the common femoral artery were free fatty acid -level in the fasting state or glucose response after a glucose load. The factors which most influenced arterial compliance were glucose level in men, and the insulin level in the fasting state or the plasma free fatty acid response after a glucose load in women. These findings indicate that blood glucose, plasma free fatty acid and plasma insulin are risk factors for changes in arterial wall characteristic at a stage when no clinical evidence of macrovascular disease is apparent. Arterial compliance was decreased and the proximal resistance of posterior tibial artery was increased in those with a low intake of protective foods compared with those with a high intake whether healthy subjects or non-insulin-dependent diabetics. Arterial compliance was decreased in non-fish eaters compared with the fish eaters whether healthy subjects or non-insulin-dependent diabetics. Proximal resistance of the posterior tibia! artery in non-fish eaters was increased compared with fish eaters in healthy subjects. Overall, food variety, a protective food score consumption and fish consumption emerge as importance determinants of arterial wall characteristics at a stage when no clinical evidence of macrovascular disease is apparent.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">complications</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051208.122550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Platform for reliable computing on clusters using group communications.</field><field name="creator">Rough, Justin</field><field name="description">Shared clusters represent an excellent platform for the execution of parallel applications given their low price/performance ratio and the presence of cluster infrastructure in many organisations.

In particular, we use existing process duplication and process migration services, and synthesise a group communications facility for use in a transparent checkpointing facility.  This research is carried out using the methods of experimental computer science.

To provide a foundation for the synthesis of the group communications and checkpointing facilities, we survey and review related work in both fields.  For group communications, we examine the V Distributed System, the x-kernel and Psync, the ISIS Toolkit, and Horus.  We identify a need for services that consider the placement of processes on computers in the cluster.  For Checkpointing, we examine Manetho, KeyKOS, libckpt, and Diskless Checkpointing.  We observe the use of remote computer memories for storing checkpoints, and the use of copy-on-write mechanisms to reduce the time to create a checkpoint of a process.

We propose a group communications facility providing two sets of services: user-oriented services and system-oriented services.  User-oriented services provide transparency and target application.  System-oriented services supplement the user-oriented services for supporting other operating systems services and do not provide transparency.  Additional flexibility is achieved by providing delivery and ordering semantics independently.

An operating system facility providing transparent checkpointing is synthesised using coordinated checkpointing.  To ensure a consistent set of checkpoints are generated by the facility, instead of blindly blocking the processes of a parallel application, only non-deterministic events are blocked.  This allows the processes of the parallel application to continue execution during the checkpoint operation.  Checkpoints are created by adapting process duplication mechanisms, and checkpoint data is transferred to remote computer memories and disk for storage using the mechanisms of process migration.  The services of the group communications facility are used to coordinate the checkpoint operation, and to transport checkpoint data to remote computer memories and disk.

Both the group communications facility and the checkpointing facility have been implemented in the GENESIS cluster operating system and provide proof-of-concept.  GENESIS uses a microkernel and client-server based operating system architecture, and is demonstrated to provide an appropriate environment for the development of these facilities.

We design a number of experiments to test the performance of both the group communications facility and checkpointing facility, and to provide proof-of-performance.  We present our approach to testing, the challenges raised in testing the facilities, and how we overcome them.  For group communications, we examine the performance of a number of delivery semantics.  Good speed-ups are observed and system-oriented group communication services are shown to provide significant performance advantages over user-oriented semantics in the presence of packet loss.  For checkpointing, we examine the scalability of the facility given different levels of resource usage and a variable number of computers.  Low overheads are observed for checkpointing a parallel application.

It is made clear by this research that the microkernel and client-server based cluster operating system provide an ideal environment for the development of a high performance group communications facility and a transparent checkpointing facility for generating a platform for reliable parallel computing on clusters.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parallel computers</field><field name="subject">disributed operating systems</field><field name="subject">genesis</field><field name="subject">v distributed systems</field><field name="subject">x-kernel</field><field name="subject">psync</field><field name="subject">isis toolkit</field><field name="subject">horus</field><field name="subject">manetho</field><field name="subject">keykos</field><field name="subject">libckpt</field><field name="subject">diskless checkpointing</field><field name="subject">checkpointing</field><field name="subject">clusters</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060412.141015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From risk to relationship: Redefining pedagogy through applied learning reform</field><field name="creator">Blake, Damien</field><field name="description">The Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL) emerged to provide more relevant curriculum programs that would cater for increasing retention rates of post-compulsory students.  It is also an example of the &#145;new&#146; learning arising from contemporary debates and reforms that highlight inadequacies of the more traditional modes of learning.

This thesis focuses on the pedagogical and sociological issues emerging from the VCAL being introduced as an &#145;alternative&#146; learning pathways for &#145;at-risk&#146; students within a traditional secondary school culture.  Through the eyes of an insider-researcher, the thesis argues for a deeper understanding of applied learning as a &#145;re-engaging&#146; pedagogy by studying the schooling experience of VCAL students and teachers.

The thesis concludes that traditional academic modes of teaching contribute to the social construction of &#145;at-risk&#146; students and argues that secondary school pedagogy needs to be redefined as a cultural phenomenon requiring teachers to be reflexively aware of their role in bridging the gap between students&#146; life experiences and the curriculum.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">applied learning</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">high school teaching</field><field name="subject">victorian certificate of applied learning</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="subject">learning psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060517.150434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparing for flexible delivery in industry: Learners and their workplaces</field><field name="creator">Smith, Peter John Brenchley</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the learning preferences and learning strategies of apprentices, and the contexts within which they learn in their workplaces.  

Since the end of the 1980s Australian vocational education and training (VET) structures and processes have undergone radical change in attempts to develop skills in the workforce that will ensure enterprise, national, and international competitiveness.  A major strategy in the national reforms has been the encouragement of flexible delivery as a means through which workplace-based learning can be accessed by a larger number of workers in ways that are cost-efficient, and that reduce the amount of time that workers spend away from their jobs.  Although flexible delivery has been championed by governments and industry alike, there has been little attempt to identify the preparedness of either learners or their workplaces for the demands of flexible learning.

The thesis examines the economic context for these changes to VET, and also examines the literature available on workplace learning.  Additionally, the thesis examines the conceptualisations of flexible delivery that are available in the literature, pointing to the possibility that the wide range of meanings associated with the term &#145;flexible delivery&#146; may result in quite different practices and expectations.  The thesis also examines the literature on independent learning and self-directed learning, and explores the concept of &#145;client-focused&#146; flexible delivery.

The study of learner preferences uses data collected from apprentices over a period of some years, in the four occupational areas commanding the highest number of apprentices in Australia.  These occupational areas are Metals and Machining, Building, Electrical, and Hairdressing.  These data on learning preferences are collected using the commercially available Canfield Learning Styles Inventory (CLSI).  The data from the sample of 389 apprentices are analysed statistically through analyses of variance, and indicate that variables such as age, gender, and occupational area are related to learning preferences.  Apprentices are shown by this analysis to prefer structured programs of instruction that are instructor-led, and to not have a high preference for independent learning or the development of their own learning goals.  Additionally, they are shown to have very low preferences for learning through reading, preferring instead to learn through direct hands-on experience.  While these characteristics are largely common among the four occupational groups, the Hairdressing apprentices are shown to have a slightly higher preference for independent learning and goal setting.  Females are shown to have a higher preference than males for learning qualitative material through reading.  Interestingly, the younger apprentices are shown to have a higher preference than the older ones for self-directed learning.  Some possibilities for that finding are discussed.  The research also shows that the learning preferences displayed by different groups of apprentices in any one program are much the same over time, providing some confidence that data generated from one group of apprentices can be used to make instructional decisions for future groups in the same program.

The data are also factor analysed to indicate three major factors underlying apprentice learning preferences.  The first factor indicates a Verbal&#150;Non-verbal preference factor, with apprentices clearly preferring to learn through non-verbal means.  A second factor is described as Structure&#150;Content, with apprentices showing a preference for learning from structured programs in a structured environment.  A third factor, Self-directed&#150;Social preference, indicates apprentices preferring to learn through socially mediated presentations and contexts rather than through more independent forms of learning.

Qualitative data are also generated through interviewing eight apprentices, and focusing on the learning strategies they employ while constructing knowledge in the workplace.  That component of the research uses a modification of the Marland, Patching and Putt (1992a, 1992b) stimulated recall technique, and a set of learning strategies derived from the work of O&#146;Malley and Chamot (1990) and Billett (1996a).  The eight apprentices are drawn from the Metals and Machining, Electrical, and Hairdressing trades.  The findings indicate that the learning strategies most often used by apprentices in the workplace are those associated with the construction of knowledge that is structured and provided by the instructor or learning program, and those that include social mediation of learning.  Additionally, the strategies associated with demonstration and hands-on practice are most favoured.  The qualitative data are confirmatory of the quantitative data. 

The research also indicates, through the apprentice interviews, that support for apprentice&#146;s learning in their workplace is typically unplanned and haphazard. Their experience was sometimes characterised by a reluctance on the part of the workplace to acknowledge learning needs such as trialling and practice of new knowledge, or pro-actively seeking understanding from other more skilled workers.

The learning preferences and learning strategies findings for apprentices, coupled with the findings of typically poor or unplanned support in the workplace, indicate that effective flexible delivery of training to apprentices in the workplace provides a number of challenges.  These challenges, it is argued, demand strategies to be developed and implemented to prepare both learners and workplaces for effective engagement with flexible delivery.  Using as a theoretical framework Kember&#146;s (1995) two-dimensional model of open learning for adults, the thesis integrates the findings into a proposed two-dimensional model of learner and workplace preparedness for flexible delivery.  The model provides for a Learner Development Space, a Workplace Development Space, and a Strategy Space.  Within the Learner Development Space, focuses for the development of learner preparedness are identified in terms of self-directed learning, skills developments, and effective participation in a community of practice.  Focuses for workplace development identified in the Workplace Development Space are those associated with development of training policies, training structures, and trainer skills and abilities.  The Strategy Space then provides detail of seventy-nine specific strategies developed to enhance learner and workplace preparedness within each of the focuses identified.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognitive styles</field><field name="subject">occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">apprenticeships</field><field name="subject">apprentices</field><field name="subject">apprenticeship programs</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">distance education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060623.095632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Providence and method: Herbert Butterfield and the interpretation of history.</field><field name="creator">Sewell, Keith Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an extended critical analysis of the methodological thought of the Cambridge historian Herbert Butterfield (1900-1979).  It is based on the full range of his published works, as well as unpublished material.  It is a contribution to the history of historiography, and to the theory of history.

The thesis concentrates on the relationship between Butterfield&#146;s views on historical research and historiographical narration, and his concept of a &#145;historical process&#146; which was the expression of a &#145;providential order&#146;.

The principal problem in Butterfield&#146;s writings is the contradiction between his advocacy of a &#145;technical history&#146; seen as free and independent of any interpretative presupposition, and his belief in Providence and its utilisation in the course of his historiography.

Firstly, the thesis argues that Butterfield employs his own presuppositions even without making explicit references to his belief in Providence.  Secondly, it explains why he embraced and advocated two contradictory standpoints.  Butterfield&#146;s position is best clarified with reference to the content of his Christian beliefs.

It is argued that Butterfield regarded all non-Christian interpretations of history as distorting oversimplifications.  They were for him not fully scientific and rigorous, because they selected some phenomenon, or principle, or institution arising within human history and made it the central interpretative principle.  He saw his own practice as exempt from this criticism.

This thesis argues that Butterfield&#146;s position is nevertheless interpretative.  However, it is argued that Butterfield&#146;s critique of ideologically based historiographic distortions and oversimplifications is important in the assessment of rival interpretations of history.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Herbert Butterfield</field><field name="subject">historians</field><field name="subject">interpretation of history</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060623.140706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Still invisible: The myth of the woman-friendly state.</field><field name="creator">Ford, Carole</field><field name="description">Australian women faced the last two decades of the twentieth century, optimistic in their capacity to contribute positively to social change in the restructuring state.  Encouraged by the relative euphoria of the late 1970s and early 1980s, women had a fleeting glimpse of the possibilities of woman-friendly legislation and feminist inspired government policy.  What eventuated was the dismantling of supportive welfare structures, under the guise of economic rationalist state action, which undermined and eventually halted women&#146;s economic and social advancement. This research project examines the impact of government policy on the welfare of Victorian women, through a feminist analysis of state and federal decision-making, framed in the context of case studies in the areas of employment, education and health.  The promotion of &#145;gender-neutral&#146; policy, by generally conservative bureaucracies, effectively exposes the mythical woman-friendly state.  The implications do not auger well for Victorian women in the new millenium.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">government policy</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">legal status</field><field name="subject">women's rights</field><field name="subject">social justice</field><field name="subject">government policy</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060628.151004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the analytical applications and fundamental chemistry of the chemiluminescent reactions of Tris(22-bipyridyl)ruthenium(III) with certain Papaver Somniferum alkaloids and other related compounds.</field><field name="creator">Gerardi, Richard David</field><field name="description">The reaction of tris(2,2&#146;-bipyridyl)ruthenium(III) (Ru(bipy) &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) with various analytes to generate chemiluminescence has been well documented.  This investigation sought to undertake a chemiluminometic study of the reactions of Ru(bipy) &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; with selected Papaver Somniferum alkaloids and specifically synthesised phenethylamines.  The investigation, based on a kinetic study, primarily addressed the effect of varying reaction conditions (pH) on Ru(bipy) &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; chemiluminescence production.  To monitor these reactions, a batch chemiluminometer was specifically designed, fabricated and automated to conduct an extensive study on the selected compounds of interest.  The instrumentation incorporated a custom built reaction cell and comprised an &#145;on-line&#146; sample preparation system with which calibration standards could be automatically prepared.  The instrumentation provided both time-independent (peak area) and time-dependent (kinetic profile) information.  A novel approach to the stabilisation of Ru(bipy) &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; as a chemiluminescencent reagent was also investigated and a recirculating system was employed with the batch chemiluminometer to provide a stable supply of Ru(bipy) &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.  Codeine, thebaine and 6-methoxy-codeine were the Papaver Somniferum alkaloids selected for this study and several N-methylated and N,N-dimethylated phenethylamines and methoxy-substituted phenetheylamines were also synthesised to investigate the affect of pH on the chemiluminescence emission efficiency.

The versatility of the batch chemiluminometer facilitated the kinetic study of numerous analytes over a broad pH range.  The exemplary performance of the chemiluminometer as an analytical instrument, was demonstrated by the calibration functions, based on peak area data, which exhibited excellent linearity and sensitivity.  The estimated detection limits (3&#963;) for the selected alkaloids were in the range 2 x 10&amp;&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;&amp;/sup;&gt; M to 7 x 10&amp;&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;&amp;/sup;&gt; at pH 5.0 and above, which compared favourably to detection limits for the same compounds determined using FIA.  Relative standard deviations (n=5) for peak areas ranged between 1% to 5% with a mean of 3.1% for all calibration standards above 2.5 x 10&amp;&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;&amp;/sup;&gt; M.  Correlation between concentration and peak area, irrespective of pH and analyte was excellent, with all but two calibration functions having r-squared values greater than 0.990.  The analytical figures of merit exemplified the precision and robustness of the reagent delivery and &#145;on-line&#146; sample preparation, as well as the sensitivity of the system.  The employment of the chemiluminometer for the measurement of total chemiluminescence emission (peak area) was in itself a feasible analytical technique, which generated highly reproducible and consistent data.  Excellent analytical figures of merit, based on peak area, were similarly achieved for the phenethylamines. 

The effects of analyte structure on chemiluminescence activity was also investigated for the alkaloids and the phenethylamines.  Subtle structural variations between the three alkaloids resulted in either a moderately reduced or enhanced total emission that was two or three fold difference only.  A significant difference in reaction kinetics was observed between thebaine and codeine/6-methoxy-codeine, which was dependent upon pH.  The time-dependent data, namely the observed rate constants for the initial rise in intensity and for the subsequent decay rate, were obtained by fitting a mathematical function (based on the postulated reaction mechanism) to the raw data.  The determination of these rate constants for chemiluminescence reactions highlighted the feasibility for utilising such measurements for quantitative analytical applications.  The kinetic data were used to discriminate between analyte responses in order to determine the concentrations of individual analytes in a binary mixture.  A preliminary, multi-component investigation performed on a binary mixture of codeine and 6-methoxy-codeine (1:1) successfully determined the concentrations of these individual components using such rate constant measurements.

Consequently, variations in kinetics resulted in a significant difference between the relative chemiluminescence response based on peak area measurements and the relative response base on peak height measurements obtained using FIA.  With regards to the observed reactivity of secondary amines and tertiary amines, chemiluminescence peak area determinations confirmed the vital role of pH on reaction efficiency, which was governed by structural features and kinetics.  The tertiary amines investigated generally produced a greater emission under acidic conditions than the corresponding secondary amines.  However, the measured chemiluminescence responses were highly dependent upon pH, with similar peak areas obtained for both amine groups under slightly alkaline conditions.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fundamental chemistry</field><field name="subject">chemiluminescent reactions</field><field name="subject">papaver somniferum</field><field name="subject">alkaloids</field><field name="subject">chemiluminescence</field><field name="subject">opium poppy</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060630.100432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aristotle's teleology</field><field name="creator">Brennan, Carmel Therese</field><field name="description">This thesis examines Aristotle&#146;s dynamic, organic model of teleological explanation to see if it is a viable alternative to material reductionism.  I argue that his teleology provides both a model for and an overview of the scientific enterprise.

Aristotle&#146;s theory of knowledge and perception is capable of exerting a unifying effect on the diversity of knowledge.  The adoption of substance ontology gives a deeper understanding of any subject than a strictly cause-effect approach.  His hylomorphism provides a clearer idea of the role of necessity in regular natural processes, and identifies the role of chance events as accidental anomalies.  His actual-potential distinction is the key to understanding both Aristotle&#146;s teleological approach and the complexity and diversity of living things.  Aristotle&#146;s teleology does not use only finality: all four conditions of change are incorporated as necessary and sufficient conditions for explanation and full understanding of change.

Aristotle&#146;s teleology, based on the human being as part of nature, is applicable at least in biological sciences to provide both a scientific methodology and a scientific method for the study of nature.  It is particularly relevant to ecological studies, while his notion of the &#145;good&#146; could be an acceptable criterion for funding of sustainable development.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aristotle</field><field name="subject">teleology</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060630.110515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of meiofauna in a temperate mangrove ecosystem in south-eastern Australia.</field><field name="creator">Gwyther, Janet</field><field name="description">The meiofauna of a mangrove forest in the River Barwon estuary was studied by means of surveys and field experiments. Distinctive assemblages of meiofauna were described from the sediment and pneumatophores of the ecosystem. Fine resolution of phytal habitats was demonstrated, and particular assemblages of meiofauna were characteristic within habitat provided by dominant epibionts. Distribution of the meiofauna within leaf litter revealed high turnover rates of nematodes, and some factors controlling detrital assemblages were assessed. The vertical profile of sedimentary meiofauna was examined, and changes in abundance were related to the tychopelagic habit of many taxa at high tide. Dispersal within the water column was confirmed by pelagic trapping, and colonisation of mimic pneumatophores was investigated. The amount of algal cover, effects of grazing by gastropods, and rugosity of the colonised surface were shown to influence meiofauna colonisation of mimic pneumatophores. Establishment and persistence of patchy distributions of meiofauna at scales of less than 10 m in an intertidal environment was demonstrated, and it was concluded that this was due to the dynamic nature of assemblages rather than their integrity.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Barwon River</field><field name="subject">meiofauna</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">temperate mangroves</field><field name="subject">South-Eastern Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060705.140427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolving concepts of leadership and influence in 21st century networking organisations</field><field name="creator">McAdam, Neil James</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">executives</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">executive ability</field><field name="subject">networking</field><field name="subject">organisations</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060706.095346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrients in Pirron Yallock Creek, southwestern Victoria : paleolimnological and management considerations.</field><field name="creator">Duthie, Troy</field><field name="description">The concentrations of various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus in the main stream and selected tributaries of Pirron Yallock Creek, southwestern Victoria were examined over a two-year period.  Exceedingly high levels of both nutrients were found within a particular tributary, while generally high nutrient levels were observed throughout the catchment.  The speciation results indicated that dairy effluent was the primary source of nutrients to Pirron Yallock Creek.

A palaeolimnological study was undertaken to determine the impact of European settlement upon waterway nutrient concentrations within the region.  The palaeolimnological study focused primarily on the diatom flora preserved within the sediments of nearby Lakes Corangamite and Bullen Merri.  Lack of preservation of diatoms within the sediments of Lake Corangamite resulted in no water quality inferences for this lake.  The preserved diatoms within Lake Bullen Merri suggested an increase in trophic status of this lake during the last 500 years.  While a change in the diatom flora of Lake Bullen Merri was evident, it was not possible to differentiate the impact of European settlement upon nutrient status of this waterway from long-term trophic status change.

In light of the particularly high nutrient concentrations observed in Pirron Yallock Creek, improved nutrient management strategies are proposed for the catchment.  These strategies, which consider current nutrient management activities, are predominantly focussed on the dairy industry, which occupies the majority of the catchment.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquatic ecology</field><field name="subject">Pirron Yallock Creek</field><field name="subject">Lake Corangamite</field><field name="subject">Lake Bullen Merri</field><field name="subject">environmental effects</field><field name="subject">nutrient pollution of water</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060706.124148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Confidentiality and disclosure : assessment and intervention issues</field><field name="creator">Eramo, Beverly Edith</field><field name="description">This portfolio addresses the moral, ethical and legal issues that impact upon decisions to maintain or disclose confidential communications.  The tensions and moral dilemmas that are created when a conflict between these aspects arises are considered.  Risk assessment procedures that inform decisions to maintain or disclose confidential information are discussed, as are issues related to the practical implementation of planned interventions.

The topic is addressed by firstly reviewing professional codes of conduct and legal requirements to maintain confidentiality.  The limits of confidentiality and privileged communication are then reviewed together with legal requirements of &#8220;duty to warn&#8221; or &#8220;duty of care&#8221;.  These requirements are then related to risk assessment procedures and relevant interventions.

Four case studies that illustrate the practical application of assessment techniques in the decision process and planned interventions are presented.  They cover such diverse topics as disclosure and suicidal intent, threat of harm to a third party, risk of transmission of the AIDS virus and &#8220;duty to warn&#8221; and maintenance of a minor&#146;s confidential communications.  The ways in which these issues were addressed and the outcome is presented.

Specifically, family caregivers&#146; responses to the illness were investigated within the parameters of the Spaniol and Zipple (1994) 4-stage model of the evolution of caregivers&#146; responses to mental illness.  The accuracy of the model&#146;s representation of the experience of caregivers across all kinship relationships to the care-recipient was evaluated.

Spaniol and Zipple proposed four stages which they termed (1) Discovery/Denial, (2) Recognition/Acceptance, (3) Coping and (4) Personal/Political Advocacy.  The first stage is characterised by persistent denial of mental illness and seeking answers from multiple sources.  The second stage involves caregivers&#146; expectations of professionals providing answers when the illness is recognised.  At this stage caregivers experience guilt, embarrassment and blame.  The cyclical nature of the illness impedes acceptance and caregivers experience a deep sense of loss and crisis of meaning as they gradually accept the reality of the situation.  In the third stage coping replaces grieving and the issues encountered include loss of faith in professionals, disruption to family life and recurrent crises.  Belief in family expertise grows and the focus of coping changes.  The fourth stage proposes that caregivers become more assertive, self-blame decreases and the focus is upon changing the system.  New meanings and values are integrated.

This study found that the model did not accurately describe the experience of all caregivers.  Caregiver did not deny mental illness and adaptive coping occurred throughout all stages.  Coping evolved as the issues encountered changed and was independent of resolution of grief.  The issues encountered were more extensive than the model proposed and differed according to kinship relationship to the care recipient.  The ways in which adaptive coping evolved were identified, as were the issues and their accompanying responses.  Caregivers coped by adaptively responding to the requirements of care provision, maintaining a sense of self worth and generating positive effect.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">caregivers</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">mentally ill</field><field name="subject">care</field><field name="subject">coping skills</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060712.152232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telecommunication technology and the professional development of teachers : challenge and opportunity</field><field name="creator">Suwannoi, Paisan</field><field name="description">The thesis explores an effective model for using the internet in a distance training program for secondary school teachers.

The four researches are: (1) Telecommunication Technology in  Thai Schools, (2) The Role of University on Science Teachers Development, (3) Computer Education Curriculum for Student Teachers: Theory and Practice, and (4) Teachers&#146; Perceptions of the Academic Link Project Between Schools and Universities for Teacher Professional Development.  The first research study provides the information about the necessary basic factors for change in Thai secondary schools and the new insights and understandings about change in Thai schooling.

The major findings were the understandings about teachers&#146; need for professional development, the available support in Thai school for professional development, and the limitations of professional development of teachers.  The second research study provides the information about the roles of university faculty on initiation and operation of science teacher development programs, science teaching and learning resources centers, science instructional media design and production services, science teaching clinics, and science teachers&#146; associations.  The third research study provides the conceptual framework for both preservice and inservice curriculum development program for teacher development.  The last research study provides a base of descriptive information about the perspectives of school teachers towards the academic link project between schools and universities and the partnership which can assist in its establishment.  The findings of these four research tasks were used for the  formation of the framework of the dissertation.  The EDNET Project, an example of  teachers&#146; professional development through the information technology based training, was developed and implemented with ten school teachers in Khon Kaen.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teachers</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="subject">professional education</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">telecommunications</field><field name="subject">telecommunication in education</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060713.104559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The weaning and growth of Anguilla australis glass eels and elvers.</field><field name="creator">Larkin, Brendan</field><field name="description">Anguilla australis glass eels proved to be resilient and present strong aquaculture potential.  General husbandry techniques, anaesthesia and prophylactic treatments were established for glass eels between 0.1 g and 2.0 g and elvers between 2.0 g and 8.0 g, caught in rivers and estuaries along the South East Coast of Victoria.  The protozoan parasites Ichthyobodo and Trichodina were found to be present on arrival to the hatchery developed during different rearing treatments, and were successfully eradicated.  A. australis glass eels accepted artificial food, but it was recommended first be fed a preweaning diet of minced fish flesh.  A weaning regime from minced fish flesh to commercially available eel grower mash, over 15 days was established.  Growth rate proved to be highly variable, both between and within groups.  The highest growth rate of 2.71%/day was found when the natural diet of minced fish and Artemia was fed.  The maximum growth rate when reared on an artificial diet of 1.63%/day was observed at 25&#176;C.  Growth was affected by the presence or absence of a preweaning diet, weaning diet, weaning period, temperature, but not by size or density.  Once weaned, glass eels were found to perform better on commercially available grower mash than on the minced fish flesh, which was used to aid in weaning them to artificial diets.  Of the water quality parameters measured stocking density was found to affect pH, Total Ammonia Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, and Dissolved Oxygen, through not to an extent which affected growth.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eels</field><field name="subject">eel industry</field><field name="subject">aquaculture</field><field name="subject">anguillidae</field><field name="subject">glass eels</field><field name="subject">elvers</field><field name="subject">weaning eels</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060713.113837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Approaches to the synthesis of peptide substituted frameworks.</field><field name="creator">Pfeffer, Frederick Matthew</field><field name="description">The 1,3 dipolar cycloaddition between carbonyl ylids (generated from cyclobutene epoxides flanked by esters) and norbornyl alkenes &#150; the ACE reaction &#150; offers a facile method for the construction of polynorbornyl molecular frameworks.  This reaction has, as described in this dissertation, underpinned the construction of molecular frameworks that have peptides and amino acids attached.  Such highly rigid peptide-frameworks are of use in the field of peptidomimetics; the template molecule governs the final positioning of any attached groups such that a precise arrangement of amino acids can be achieved without the need to construct entire proteins.

In the course of any ACE reaction the ester flanked cyclobutene epoxide is transformed to a 1,3 dipole, the esters serve to stablise this reactive intermediate and are as a consequence incorporated in the reaction product.  Modification of these esters provides pseudo-equatorial points for peptide attachment.  These methyl esters were replaced with tert-butyl esters to provide pseudo-axial attachment points that could be selectively addressed.

The optimal strategy for peptide-framework construction involved direct condensation of carboxyl protected amino acids to bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-endo-carboxylic acid as well as condensation of amino acids to cyclobutene epoxides derived from this acid.  The ACE reaction of (&#177;) bicycloheptene-2-endo-carboxylic acid derivatives with cyclobutene epoxides synthesised from such racemic acid derivatives provided a mixture of enantiomers and meso compounds.  In order to control the position of the attachment points &#150; and hence the final location of the attached peptides &#150; the ACE reaction required chiral starting materials.  Accordingly, all peptidoframeworks were derived from the chiral (2S)-(-)-bicycloheptene carboxylic acid.  The ACE reaction of this (S)-norbornene with the (S)-epoxide provided a peptide framework in which the attached amino acids were positioned pseudo-axially.  Deprotection of the amino acid allowed peptide chain building in the pseudo-axial direction.  Using this strategy a framework with an alanine residue and a triglycine peptide was synthesised.  By combining this strategy with the ter-butyl ester variant a framework with pseudo-axial alanine and pseudo-equatorial glycine residues was manufactured.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular structure</field><field name="subject">peptides</field><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="subject">chemical structure</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060713.125622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiating life choices: living with motor neurone disease.</field><field name="creator">King, Susan Jane</field><field name="description">Motor neurone disease (MND) is an uncommon neurodegenerative disease that is terminal and has an insidious onset. With no known cause or cure, the disease triggers progressive death of motor neurones that causes increasing difficulties with mobility, communication, breathing and nutrition. Most research focuses on the disease process, but little is known of the illness experience from the perspective of those diagnosed with the disease. The aim of this study was to explore what it is like to live with MND and how people with the disease negotiate with others to exercise choice over the way they live. 
A grounded theory methodology was used to explore the life world of people diagnosed and living with MND. Data were collected via in-depth interviews, their stories and photographs, poems and books participants identified as important and fieldnotes. The textual data were analysed using constant comparative analysis. The majority of participants experienced difficulty with verbal communication. Some invited a third person to interpret their speech and others used assistive technologies such as Lightwriters and computers. 
Analysis revealed three constructs that, together, told the story of the MND illness experience. First, was the &#8220;diagnosis story&#8221; that described the devastating process of repeated tests had on the participants, shattering their trust in the competence of the health care system. The second construct revealed the process of living with MND as cyclical and repetitive requiring constant decision-making to adapt to the ongoing changes connected with the disease. The core theme and basic social process of &#8220;maintaining personal integrity&#8221; evolved as the third construct. This process underpinned and explained participants&#146; decision-making. Finally a substantive theory was conceptualised as the illness experience: &#8220;maintaining personal integrity in the face of ongoing change and adaptation&#8221;. This theory illustrates that the basic social process of maintaining personal integrity is central to decision and choice making while living with MND. 
The findings have implications for people with MND, their carers, health professionals and service providers. Recommendations include improved counselling services for people at the time of diagnosis; the introduction of nurse specialists to support health professionals, people diagnosed with the disease and their families; open, accessible, realistic health and funding policies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motor Neurone Disease</field><field name="subject">life choices</field><field name="subject">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060719.144725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of labour market reform on women in the Australian banking industry.</field><field name="creator">Sayers, Mary</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">banks and banking</field><field name="subject">bank employees</field><field name="subject">enterprise bargaining</field><field name="subject">industrial relations</field><field name="subject">labour market reform</field><field name="subject">Australian banking industry</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060719.151710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Images of embodied old age in contemporary Japan.</field><field name="creator">King, Christopher</field><field name="description">Since the late 1980s, representations of Japanese national identity and Japanese old age have been deconstructed.  Images of the resilience of traditional cultural and social institutions are shown to have over-emphasized social and cultural homogeneity, elided social differentiation and inequality and minimized the significance of historical transformation.  Key institutions of the postwar modernization project, including the patriarchal seniority system and household structure, are being transformed through globalization and feminization.

This thesis focuses on the problem of representing individual and collective ageing
in Japan in the context of modernization.  Research is focussed on the contradictions, within essentialist representations of Japanese collective and individual identity, between socially constructed policy forms of old age and collective identities.  Contemporary trends towards individualization and diversification of identities, and discourses on the ageing/information society, indicate cultural distance between an instrumentally rational administration and the life world of old people.

Research explores the concept of embodiment through its significance in debates on postmodernization of the lifecourse in accordance with the structural shifts towards a postindustrial structure.  This study examines representations of old age in broader social and cultural processes.  Images of the social and cultural trajectory of the lifecourse draw attention to the embodiment of individual identities and ultimately generational cultures in contemporary social and cultural spaces.

This research is the result of analyses of old age, which have been informed by postmodern theory.  It in turn informs sociological theorizations of cultural representations of old age in contemporary societies.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Older people in Japan</field><field name="subject">old age Japanese</field><field name="subject">post industrial structure</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060719.155237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamentalism meets feminism: Postmodern confrontation in the work of Janette Turner Hospital</field><field name="creator">Nanlohy, Elizabeth Mavis</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Judeo-Christian</field><field name="subject">writing of Janette Turner Hospital</field><field name="subject">Janette Turner Hospital</field><field name="subject">Pentecostal Church</field><field name="subject">women authors</field><field name="subject">Australian women authors</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060720.090953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and application of a microelectrode based scanning voltammetric detector.</field><field name="creator">Tait, Russell John</field><field name="description">A large part of the work presented in this thesis describes the development and use of a novel electrochemical detector designed to allow the electrochemical characterisation of compounds in flowing solution by means of cyclic voltammetry.  The detector was microprocessor controlled, which provides digital generation of the potential waveform and collection of data for subsequent analysis.  Microdisk working electrodes are employed to permit both thermodynamic and kinetically controlled processes to be studied under steady-state conditions in flowing solutions without the distortion or hysteresis normally encountered with larger sized electrodes.  The effect of electrode size, potential scan rate, and solution flow rate are studied extensively with the oxidation of ferrocene used as an example of a thermodynamically controlled process and a series of catecholamines as examples of a kinetically controlled process.  The performance of the detector was best demonstrated when used as a HPLC post-column detector.  The 3-dimensional chromatovoltammograms obtained allow on-line characterisation of each fraction as it elutes from the column.

The rest of the work presented in this thesis involves the study of the oxidative degradation pathway of dithranol.  The oxidative pathway was shown to involve a complex free radical mechanism, dependent on the presence of both oxygen and, in particular light.  The pathway is further complicated by the fact that dithranol may exist in either a keto or enol form, the enol being most susceptible to oxidation.  A likely mechanism is proposed from studies performed with cyclic voltammetry and controlled potential electrolysis, then defined by subsequent kinetic studies.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Voltammetry</field><field name="subject">Microelectrodes</field><field name="subject">Dithranol</field><field name="subject">microelectrode based scanning voltammetric detector</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060720.100447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A technique for improving the reception of scattering signal behind an obstacle.</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Shaun Ashley</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a solution to the problem of receiving a signal in the shadow and fringe areas.  Theoretical and experimental investigation of the field behind an obstacle in a line of sight transmission path for UHF / microwave signals has resulted in a new approach to the analysis of electromagnetic fields in the shadow of an obstacle.

Analysis using this approach showed the field 
to consist of varying amplitude and phase distribution.  Additional analysis predicted an increase in received signal could be achieved if correlation between the field and antenna
structure could be obtained.  This was accomplished with a new antenna design.

The thesis presents experimental and photographic evidence to support the theory.  A novel technique involving the matching of the antenna structure to the field distribution, resulted in an increase of received signal in the diffracted field of up to 4 dB.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radio</field><field name="subject">radio reception</field><field name="subject">television</field><field name="subject">television reception</field><field name="subject">antennas</field><field name="subject">scattering signal</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060726.151839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of contextual interference on children learning forehand tennis groundstrokes.</field><field name="creator">Farrow, Damian Thomas</field><field name="description">Previous research on contextual interference theory in controlled laboratory situations consistently illustrated that random practice was superior to blocked practice when learning motor skills.  However, when considered in relation to physical education class settings the findings of the contextual interference experiments were not as uniform.  Furthermore, the results of the contextual interference research were ambiguous when an open skill was used as the experimental task, with no definite trend evident.  Random practice was found more effective for learning (del Rey, 1989) whereas French, Rink and Werner (1990) demonstrated blocked practice to be superior.  In the present study, the influence of high and low contextual interference as practice schedules was investigated within an applied sports setting using an open sports skill as the experimental task.  Two groups of boys and girls, 8-9 and 10-12 years of age, were taught a forehand tennis groundstroke using both their preferred and non-preferred hands over a ten week coaching and practice period.  The findings showed that male subjects were significantly better at the experimental task than female subjects at the pre-test stage only.  The result also demonstrated that the 10-12 year old subjects were significantly better than the 8-9 year olds at the task with the exception of the preferred hand at the post and retention test stage.  The contextual interference effect was demonstrated in the retention phase on the preferred hand of the 10-12 year old subjects where the random practice group was significantly better than the blocked practice group in an applied sports setting.   These findings were discussed in relation to the role of cognition in the learning of these motor skills and the influence of the subjects related background experiences.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tennis</field><field name="subject">tennis for children</field><field name="subject">motor learning</field><field name="subject">children learning</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060727.112040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge, identities and dilemmas of the self in physical education teacher education</field><field name="creator">Rossi, Anthony James</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to understand how becoming a physical education teacher is shaped by personally and socially constructed knowledge and is affected by the rules and resources of the structural systems in which physical education teacher education (PETE) takes place.  The study was influenced by the traditions of Personal Construct Theory (Kelly 1955), the theoretical tenets of social constructionism (Gergen 1991), and Giddens&#146;s work on structuration (1984) and self-identity (1991).

Ten PETE students participated in the study over almost three years.  They undertook repertory grid sessions periodically through their study, followed by &#145;learning conversations&#146;, in which the grid itself was discussed, reworked and collaboratively analysed.  All conversations were audio taped and were fully transcribed.  The data were analysed in three ways, all of which were used to construct a story of the study.  First, the grids were analysed for patterns, consistencies across students and for consistencies within students.  These grids provided the first level story that related to constructions of knowledge.  These constructions were then content analysed using analysis categories developed from Gergen&#146;s notion of the saturated self and Giddens&#146; ideas of identity in late modernity.  These analyses represented what Giddens calls a double hermeneutic since to all intents and purposes, the story of the study was constructed from the participants&#146; constructions of what it is to be a physical education teacher.

The data suggests that during the process of constructing professional knowledge the student experienced a series of dilemmas of professional self-identity.  It seems that to become a PE teacher, the dilemmas must be worked through until a position of what Giddens calls ontologist security has been achieved.  Some students in this study had not managed to reach such a point before they left university and entered the teaching profession.  In spite of this, the methods of the study allowed the participants to begin to articulate their theories and visions of teaching physical education.  The therapeutic qualities of Kelly&#146;s theory encouraged a number of the students to &#145;see it differently&#146; (Rossi, 1997) and to begin to develop a rationale for physical education based on educational practice that considers the needs of individuals and the promotion of a socially just community.  I have argued however that this &#145;critical&#146; approach to physical education pedagogy was considered risky and as such students who were prepared to engage in such risk strategies also had other strategic relational selves (Gergen, 1991) to minimise risk at key times during their teacher education.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PE teachers</field><field name="subject">physical education teachers</field><field name="subject">dilemmas of self</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060727.140209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the human lymphocyte P2Z receptor and its activation of phospholipase D.</field><field name="creator">Gargett, Caroline Eve</field><field name="description">Extracellular adenosine 5&#8242;-triphosphate (ATP) is an agonist for the P2Z receptor of human leukaemic lymphocytes and opens a Ca &lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective ion channel, which also conducts Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the small fluorescent dye, ethidium&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. A wide range of receptor agonists, many of which raise cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] activate phospholipase D (PLD). In the present study, it was shown that both ATP and 3&#8242;-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP) stimulated PLD activity in a concentration-dependent manner, and the inhibitory effects of suramin, oxidised ATP, extracellular Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; suggested that the effect of these agonists is mediated by P2Z receptors. 
The role of divalent cations in ATP-stimulated PLD activity was investigated. Several agonists (eg ATP, thapsigargin, ionomycin) stimulated a rise in cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] in human lymphocytes, but only ATP and ionomycin stimulated PLD activity. When Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx was prevented by EGTA, the majority of ATP-stimulated and all of ionomycin-stimulated PLD activity was inhibited. Preloading cells with the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; chelator, BAPTA, reduced cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] and, paradoxically, ATP-stimulated PLD activity was potentiated. ATP-stimulated PLD activity was supported by both Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; when they were substituted for extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, both ATP-stimulated PLD activity and ATP-stimulated &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx showed a linear dependence on extracellular [Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]. Thus it was concluded that ATP stimulated PLD activity in direct proportion to the influx of divalent cations through the P2Z ion channel and this PLD activity was insensitive to changes in bulk cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]. 
The calmodulin (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/CaM) inhibitor, trifluoperazine (TFP) inhibited ionomycin- and ATP-stimulated PLD activity and ATP-stimulated apoptosis, but had no effect on PLD activity already activated by ATP. However, TFP inhibited ATP-stimulated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and ethidium&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fluxes, at concentrations below those which inhibit Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/CaM, suggesting that TFP inhibits the P2Z receptor.
Similarly, the isoquinolinesulphonamide, KN-62, a selective inhibitor of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), also prevented ATP-stimulated apoptosis, but had no effect on pre-activated PLD. In addition, KN-62, and an analogue, KN-04, which has no effect on CaMKII, potently inhibited ATP-stimulated Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 12.7 &#177; 1.5 and 17.3 &#177; 2.7 nM, respectively), ATP-stimulated ethidium&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 13.1 &#177; 2.6 and 37.2 &#177; 8.9 nM, respectively), ATP-stimulated phospholipase D activity (50% inhibition 5.9 &#177; 1.2 and 9.7 &#177; 2.8 nM, respectively) and ATP-induced shedding of the surface adhesion molecule, L-selectin (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 31.5 &#177; 4.5 and 78.7 &#177; 10.8 nM, respectively). They did not inhibit phorbol ester- or ionomycin-stimulated PLD activity or phorbol ester-induced L-selectin shedding. Neither KN-62 nor KN-04 (both 500 nM) have any effect on UTP-stimulated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in fura-2-loaded human neutrophils, a response which is mediated by the P2Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, neither did they inhibit ATP-stimulated contractile responses mediated by the P2X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor of guinea pig urinary bladder. Thus, KN-62 and KN-04 are almost equipotent as P2Z inhibitors with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;s in the nanomolar, indicating that their actions cannot be due to CaMKII inhibition, but rather that they are potent and direct inhibitors of the P2Z receptor.
Extracellular ATP-induced shedding of L-selectin from lymphocytes into the medium is a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent response. L-selectin is either cleaved by a metalloproteinase or a PLD with specificity for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). The novel hydroxamic acid-based zinc chelator, Ro-31-9790 blocks ATP-induced L-selectin shedding, but was without effect on ATP-induced Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx or ATP-stimulated PLD activity. Furthermore, another zinc chelator, 1,10-phenanthroline, an inhibitor of a GPI-PLD, potentiated rather than inhibited ATP-stimulated PLD activity, suggesting that ATP-induced L-selectin shedding and ATP-stimulated PLD activity are independent of each other.
Although extracellular ATP is the natural ligand for the lymphocyte P2Z receptor, it is less potent than BzATP in stimulating Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx. Concentration-response curves for BzATP- and ATP-stimulated ethidium&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; influx gave EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;s 15.4 &#177; 1.4 &#181;M and 85.6 &#177; 8.8 &#181;M, respectively. The maximal response to ATP was only 69.8 &#177; 1.9% of that for BzATP. Hill coefficients were 3.17 &#177; 0.24 and 2.09 &#177; 0.45 for BzATP and ATP respectively, suggesting greater positive cooperativity for BzATP than for ATP in opening the P2Z-operated ion channel. A rank order of agonist potency of BzATP &gt; ATP = 2MeSATP &gt; ATP&#947;S was observed for agonist-stimulated ethidium&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, while maximal influxes followed a rank order of BzATP &gt; ATP &gt; 2MeSATP &gt; ATP&#947;S. When ATP (300 -1000 &#181;M) was added simultaneously with 30 &#181;M BzATP (EC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;), it reduced both ethidium&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; fluxes by 30 - 40% relative to values observed with BzATP alone. KN-62, previously shown to be a specific inhibitor of the lymphocyte P2Z receptor, was a less potent antagonist of BzATP-induced fluxes than ATP, when maximal concentrations of both agonists (50 and 500 &#181;M respectively) were used. However, when BzATP (18 &#181;M) was used at a concentration equiactive with a maximally effective ATP concentration, KN-62 showed the same inhibitory potency for both agonists. The ecto-ATPase antagonist, ARL-67156, inhibited both ATP- and BzATP-stimulated Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, suggesting that the lower efficacy of ATP compared with BzATP was not due to preferential hydrolysis of ATP. Thus, the natural ligand, ATP, is a partial agonist for the P2Z receptor while BzATP is a full agonist. Moreover the competitive studies show that only a single class of P2-receptor (P2Z class) is expressed on human leukaemic lymphocytes.
Both ATP- and BzATP-stimulated PLD activity were significantly inhibited (P &lt; 0.05) when cells were suspended in iso-osmotic choline Cl medium. Choline&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was found to be a permeant for the P2Z ion channel, since ATP induced a large uptake of [&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]choline&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (60 to 150 &#181;mol/ml intracellular water) during a 5 min incubation, which remained in the cells for several hours, and ATP was used to load cells with these levels of choline&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

It was found that rat ANP (rANP) influenced stomatal opening movement in Tradescantia sp., where a significant increase in stomatal opening was observed in the presence of 1 &#181;M rANP.  Furthermore, this effect is mediated by cGMP, a (putative) second messenger of NPs.  Two inhibitors of guanylyl cyclase, LY 83583 and methylene blue, inhibited rANP-induced stomatal opening.  In contrast, stomatal opening is induced in a concentration dependent manner by the cell permeant cGMP analogue 8-Br-cGMP.  In addition it was found, that like in animals, the secondary structure of rANP is essential for rANP responses.  Linearised rANP is biologically inactive.

Since ANP elicit plant responses, an attempt was made to isolate NP analogues from plants.  A protocol for partially purifying NP from plants was developed.  It was found that two fractions eluted from an immunoaffinity chromatography column (0.5 M KCI eluted fraction and 0.75 M KCI eluted fraction) were biologically active.

The level of cGMP in response to NPs was also tested.  It is suggested that the receptor of NP is specific since only 0.75 M KCI eluted fractions increased cGMP levels in Zea mays root stele tissue.  rANP did not elicit an effect on cGMP levels in this tissue and LY 83583 did not affect this response.  It is therefore argued that a plant specific biologically active NP system is present in the stele and it is predicted that NPs modulate solute movement in this tissue.

NPs also influence K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fluxes in Zea mays root stele.  Increase in both K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na+ uptake were observed after 30 min., while H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux shifted immediately toward influx in the presence of both 0.5 and 0.75 KCI eluted fractions.  Finally, a model is proposed for the effect of NPs on solute movement and its signalling system in plants.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant hormones</field><field name="subject">natriuretic peptide hormones</field><field name="subject">plants</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060727.145040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental study of abattoir wastewater treatment from an economic perspective.</field><field name="creator">Verhoef, Geoffrey D.</field><field name="description">The most cost effective treatment scheme for effluent from Midfield Meats, an abattoir in Warrnambool, Australia, was evaluated via a series of laboratory and commercial scale experiments.

poses particularly significant challenges to the international tax regime in terms of its
current profit allocation rules.  Multinational banks are a unique subset of
multinational entities, and as a consequence of their unique traits, the traditional
international tax regime foes not yield an optimal interjurisdictional allocation of
taxing rights.  The opportunity for tax minimisation, achievable because of the unique
traits, and realised through exploitation of the traditional source and transfer pricing
regime, results in a jurisdictional distribution of taxing rights which does not reflect economic reality.

There are two distinct ways in which the traditional international tax regime fails to
reflect economic activity.  The first way that economic activity may not be reflected
in the distribution of the taxing rights to income from multinational banking is
through the application of traditional source rules.  The traditional sources rules
allocate income where transactions are completed rather than where the
intermediation services are arranged.  As a result of their unique commercial role as
financial intermediaries, by separating intermediary economic activity from legal
transactions with third parties, multinational banks may distort the true location of the
activity giving rise to income.

The second way in which the traditional tax regime may fail to reflect economic
activity is through the traditional transfer pricing regime requiring related or internal
transaction to be undertaken at an arm&#146;s length price.  The arm&#146;s length pricing
requirement is theoretically deficient in its failure to recognise the highly integrated
nature of multinational banking.  In practice, the arm&#146;s length pricing requirement is
also difficult, if not impossible, to apply to multinational banks because of the 
requirement of comparability.  The difficulties associated with the current model have
resulted in a subtle move by multinational banks towards global formulary
apportionment.

This thesis concludes that, for the international taxation of multinational banks, the current source regime should be replaced with a system that allocates profits for tax
purposes on the basis of income source, with source determined using a unitary
taxation or global formulary apportionment system.  It is argued that global formulary
apportionment is a theoretically superior model that provides both jurisdiction to tax
and allocated profits on the basis of the economic activity that generates the income.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">banks</field><field name="subject">banking</field><field name="subject">taxation</field><field name="subject">international banking</field><field name="subject">multinational banking</field><field name="subject">economic activity</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060728.112650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ontogeny of putative GABAergic neurons and their receptors in the nervous system of the crayfish Cherax destructor.</field><field name="creator">Foa, Lisa Catherine</field><field name="description">Inhibitory neurons exert control the expression of many aspects of behaviour by regulating the effectiveness of excitatory neural function.  By comparison with excitatory neural systems, relatively little is known about the development of inhibitory neurons and the influence which these neurons exert on the development of other neural systems.  Two issues which relate to the development of inhibitory neurons are of particular interest.  First, a paradox arises when inhibitory neurons are considered in terms of modern models of synaptic development which involve activity-dependent mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. Second, there is some evidence that inhibitory neurotransmitters may act in a special trophic manner during the early development of nervous systems.  Investigations of these issues would be greatly facilitated in a neural system in which it was possible to experimentally control aspects of the development of individual pre- and postsynaptic cells.  The aim of the results presented in this thesis was to characterise the normal development of one such system: the GABAergic inhibitory system of the Australian freshwater crayfish, Cherax destructor.

The ontogeny of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA across the embryonic period of 30% to 100% development was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques.  GABA-like immunoreactive cells and fibres were first detected in the embryonic brain region.  The expression of GABA-like immunoreactivity progressed along a rostro-caudal gradient, with GABA-like immunoreactive cells being detected in the most anterior thoracic ganglia at 45% development and in all ganglia by 65% development.  GABA-like immunoreactive fibres were evident in peripheral nerves as early as 55% development and ramified extensively throughout the neuropil of the nervous system by 65% development.  By contrast, immunoreactivity to the primary excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, was not detected until 60-65% development.  Glutamate-like immunoreactivity at 60-65% development was evident only in the form of punctate staining in the midline of the ventral nerve cord.  Cell body staining was observed only at 90% development and was restricted to only a few cells on the periphery of the ventral nerve cord.

Radio-labelled ligand binding methods and autoradiography were used to study the expression of putative GABA receptors in the Cherax embryos from 30% to 100% development.  Specific binding was evident in the earliest embryos studies at 30% development.  There was an initial increase in binding from 30% to 40% development, followed by a dramatic drop to almost zero binding at 50-55% development.  This was followed by a gradual increase in binding levels with age, reaching a plateau at 85% development.  Preliminary pharmacological evaluation of binding indicated that at least three GABA receptor types were expressed during embryonic development.

Methods for culturing, dissociated neural tissues explanted form Cherax embryos at 85% development were established.  The success of cultures was demonstrated by neurite extension, and neuronal networks in which neurons appeared to form connections with other neurons and with explanted muscle cells after two days in culture.  Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that some explanted neurons expressed GABA-like immunoreactivity within two days of explanting.

These studies have provided a comprehensive description of the development of GABAergic neurons and their receptors in Cherax destructor embryos.  The very early expression of GABA-like immunoreactivity, coupled with the early onset of specific GABA binding, strongly indicates that the GABAergic neurons are functional and able to exert an effect on other cells during much of the period of nervous system development in crayfish embryos.  These results support the hypothesis that inhibitory neurons may play an important role as regulators of the overall process of assembly and maturation of the nervous system and provide a substantial basis for future experimental studies in which the specific action of inhibitory neurons on the development of discrete components of the crayfish nervous system may be investigated.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cherax destructor</field><field name="subject">neurons</field><field name="subject">GABAergic</field><field name="subject">receptors</field><field name="subject">crayfish</field><field name="subject">nervous systems</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060728.141951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor concentration and overflow in the rat central nervous system.</field><field name="creator">McClure-Sharp, Jilliane Mary</field><field name="description">Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is the primary hormone of the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis (HPA-axis).  In addition to its endocrine function, it has been proposed that CRF acts as a neurotransmitter.  The widespread distribution of CRF immunoreactivity  and CRF receptors in the rat central nervous system (CNS) supports this theory.  Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated high levels of CRF immunoreactivity   the rat hypothalamus, a brain region involved in the regulation and integration of a variety of endocrine and autonomic homeostatic mechanisms.  CRF has been shown to be  involved in a number of these activities such as blood pressure control, food and water intake, behaviour and emotional integration.  Many of these activities demonstrate progressive dysfunction as ageing proceeds.  The aim of this thesis was to investigate the regulation of CRF in the rat CNS, particularly over the period of maturation and ageing. Tissue extraction and peptide radioimmunoassay (RIA) techniques were developed in order to measure regional CRF concentrations as a function of age in the rat CNS.   Seven  brain  regions  were examined including the hypothalamus, pituitary, medulla  oblongata, pons, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and midbrain.  Three age ranges were investigated: 3 &#150; 4 weeks, 4 &#150; 5 months and 14 &#150; 18 months, representing young, mature and old age groups.  Data for the tissues of individual rats from each age group were analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Scheff&#233; tests (SPSS  Release 6 for  Windows, 1989 &#150; 1993). CRF  were detected in measurable quantities in all brain regions examined.  Different age-related patterns of change were observed in each brain region.  CRF concentrations (ng/g tissue) were highest in the pituitaries of young rats and were significantly reduced over the period of maturation (P&lt; 0.05).  However, the high CRF concentration of the young rat pituitary was likely to be a factor of the smaller tissue mass.  Although the absolute CRF content (ng/tissue) of this tissue appeared to decline with maturation and ageing, the reduction was not significant (P&gt;0.05).  Therefore the pituitary of the young rat was relatively enriched with CRF per gram tissue.  The highest CRF concentration in mature and aged rats was measured in the hypothalamus, in accordance with previous immunohistochemical studies.  Hypothalamic CRF concentrations (ng/g tissue) demonstrated no significant alterations with maturation and ageing.  The absolute CRF content (ng/tissue) of the hypothalamus was significantly less  in  the young rat compared to mature and aged animals, however this was accompanied  by a smaller  tissue mass (P&lt;0.05).  The  CRF  concentrations (ng/g tissue) of the rat cerebral cortex and medulla oblongata demonstrated significant reduction with advancing age (P&lt;0.05), however in both cases this appeared to be due to significant increases  in  mean  tissue mass.  The absolute CRF content of these tissues (ng/tissue) were  not  significantly  different  over  the  period of maturation and ageing (P&gt;0.05).  CRF  concentration  (ng/g tissue)  and absolute content (ng/tissue) of the pons demonstrated a trend to increase with advanced age in the rat, however this was not significant  in  both  cases (P&gt;0.05).  Of  interest  were  the significant increases observed in the CRF concentrations of the cerebellum and midbrain (ng/g tissue with advanced ageing (P&lt;0.05).  Significant increases were also observed in the mean tissue mass and absolute CRF content (ng/tissue) of these regions in aged rats (P&lt;0.05).  These findings perhaps indicate increased CRF synthesis and or decreased CRF turnover in these tissues with advancing age. The second stage of these studies examined age-related alterations in basal and potassium-stimulated hypothalamic CRF and overflow over the period of maturation and ageing in the rat, and required the preliminary development of an in vitro tissue  superfusion system.  The concomitant release of the co-modulatory compound,  neuropeptide Y (NPY) was also measured.  NPY has been shown to positively regulate CRF release and gene expression in the hypothalamus.  In addition, NPY has been demonstrated to be involved in a number of hypothalamic activities, including blood pressure  control and  food intake regulation.  Hypothalamic superfusion data were analysed using one factor repeated measures ANOVA (SPSS Release 6 for Windows,  1989-1993)  followed  by least significant difference tests ( Snedecor and Cochran, 1967) to enable both time and age comparisons.  Basal hypothalamic CRF overflow was unaltered with maturation and ageing in the rat.  Potassium stimulation (56 mM) elicted a significant 2 &#150; 3 fold increase in hypothalamic CRF overflow across age groups (P&lt;0.05).  Stimulated hypothalamic CRF overflow was significantly greater in the young rat compared to the mature and aged animals (P&lt;0.05).  The enhanced response to depolarizing stimulus was observed at an age when the absolute CRF content of the  hypothalamus was significantly less that of other age groups.  It is possible that the enhanced responsiveness of the young rat may be of survival advantage in life threatening situations.  Basal hypothalamic NPY overflow was much less than that of CRF, and potassium stimulation resulted in a very different age-related profile.  The hypothalamic NPY response to depolarization was significantly reduced in the young rat and declined significantly  with advanced  ageing  (P&lt;0.05).  The  contrasting profiles of stimulated CRF and NPY overflow may indicate the activity of alternative regulatory factors present in the hypothalamus, whose activity may also be affected in an age-related manner. The final stage of these studies examined the nature of NPY modulation of hypothalamic CRF overflow in the mature rat.  The facilitatory effect of NPY on hypothalamic CRF overflow was confirmed.  The application of NPY (0.1 &#181;M) significantly  increased  CRF  overflow approximately 4 fold of basal (P&lt;0.05).  In addition, the role of the NPY-Y1 receptor was investigated by the prior application of Y1 receptor antagonists, GW1229 (0.05 &#181;M).  At this concentration GW1229 significantly reduced hypothalamic CRF overflow induced by perfusion with NPY (0.1 &#181;m), P&lt;0.05.  It was concluded the Y1 receptor does have a role in the regulation of hypothalamic CRF overflow by NPY.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">central nervous systems</field><field name="subject">central nervous system in rats</field><field name="subject">corticotropin realasing hormone</field><field name="subject">neuroendocrinology</field><field name="subject">brain chemistry</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060802.143911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards development of a quality cost model for automotive stamping.</field><field name="creator">de Ruyter, Adam</field><field name="description">The current work used discrete event simulation techniques to model the economics of quality within an actual automotive stamping plant.  Automotive stamping is a complex, capital intensive process requiring part-specific tooling and specialised machinery.  Quality control and quality improvement is difficult in the stamping environment due to the  general lack of process  understanding and the large number  to interacting variables.  These factors have prevented the widespread use of statistical process control. 

In this work, a model of the quality control techniques used at the Ford Geelong Stamping plant is developed and indirectly validated against results from production.  To date, most discrete event models are of systems where the quality control process is clearly defined by the rules of statistical process control.  However, the quality control technique used within the stamping plant is for the operator to perform a 100% visual inspection while unloading the finished panels.  In the developed model, control is enacted after a cumulative count of defective items is observed, thereby approximating the operator who allows a number of defective panels to accumulate before resetting the line.  Analysis of this model found that the cost sensitivity to inspection error is dependent upon the level of control and that the level of control determines line utilisation.  Additional analysis of this model demonstrated that additional inspection processes would lead to more stable cost structures but these structures many not necessarily be lower cost.

 The model was subsequently applied to investigate the economics of quality improvement.  The quality problem of panel blemishes, induced by slivers (small metal fragments), was chosen as a case stuffy.  Errors of 20-30% were observed during  direct validation of the cost model and it was concluded that the use of discrete event simulation models for applications requiring high accuracy would not be  possible unless the production system was of low complexity.  However, the model could be used to evaluate the sensitivity of input factors and investigating the effects of a number of potential improvement opportunities.

Therefore, the research concluded that it is possible to use discrete event simulation to  determine the quality economics of an actual stamping plant.  However, limitations imposed by inability of the model to consider a number of external factors, such as continuous improvement, operator working conditions or wear and the lack of reliable quality data, result in low cost accuracy.  Despite this, it still can be demonstrated that discrete event simulation has significant benefits over the alternate modelling methods.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metal stamping</field><field name="subject">Geelong Ford Plant</field><field name="subject">sheet steel</field><field name="subject">quality control</field><field name="subject">simulation methods</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060803.123754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology and biochemistry of budburst in Vitis vinifera</field><field name="creator">Campbell, James Alexander</field><field name="description">Both the physiological and biochemical control of budburst in the grapevine, Vitis Vinifera L. were investigated.  It was found that the accuracy of a predictive  model  for  grapevine  budburst  based  on ambient temperature was limited under the experimental conditions.  There was a significant correlation of 4.7 &#177; 0.3 days between the days of maximal xylem exudation and budburst over the 3 years of investigation.  The co-relationships between daily xylem exudate volume and a range of environmental parameters were considered.  It was found that soil temperature was highly correlated against daily xylem exudation.  Ambient temperature and soil moisture were significantly correlated with xylem exudation, however the coefficients of correlation were much lower than that of soil temperature.  Rainfall showed only a very limited correlation with daily xylem exudate flow.

Seasonal variations in the pH and the carbohydrate and inorganic nutrient concentrations of xylem exudate were investigated.  Exudate carbohydrate concentrations fell from 660 &#181;M before the day of maximal xylem exudation to zero levels within 4 weeks.  Xylem exudate pH was found to consistently fall to a minimum at the time of maximal exudate flow.  Exudate concentrations of the metallic cofactors Ca, K, Mg, Mn and Zn varied directly with daily exudate flow, suggesting some sort of flow-dependent mobilisation of these nutrients.

A growth promontory oligosaccharide fraction was prepared by partial acid hydrolysis of grapevine primary cell wall material.  This fraction significantly increased control growth of the Lemna minor L. bioassay over a limited &#145;window&#146; of bioactivity.

A growth inhibitory oligosaccharide fraction, similar in activity to abscisic acid was isolated from grapevine xylem exudate prior to budburst.  The exudate concentration or efficacy of this substance declined after budburst such that there was no apparent growth inhibition.

A model is proposed for grapevine budburst whereby an oligosaccharide growth inhibitor is gradually removed from the xylematic stream under the effects of soil temperature, allowing the surge of metabolic activity and vegetative growth that constitute budburst.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapevines</field><field name="subject">vines</field><field name="subject">grapes</field><field name="subject">viticulture</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">budburst</field><field name="subject">Vitis vinifera</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060808.123121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concepts and principles in unjust enrichment: A comparative study</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, John Bede</field><field name="description">The Thesis was inspired by a perceived need better to understand the unique description
of unjust enrichment by the Australian courts, as a unifying legal concept.  It
demonstrates that concepts and principles are essential features of the common law
because they identify the character and taxonomy of rules.  The comparative study,
encompassing Australian and English law primarily, and law of other jurisdictions,
modern and ancient, elucidates the special characteristics of the concepts and principles
of Anglo/Australian unjust enrichment and of concepts and principles generally.

A like concept has had a place in the common law since its inception under several
characterisations.  It bears the mark of ancient Roman jurisprudence, but relates to
independent principles.  The jurisprudence was formed by special characteristics of its
history.  It is distinct from modern Roman/Dutch law but the doctrinal overtones of its
foundational case law reflect the basis of reasoning which in Continental law, is found in the adopted ancient codes.  It is this foundation of reasoning and the firm rejection of a normative general principle that makes Anglo/Australian law different in character and jurisprudence from unjust enrichment in USA and Canada.

Stifled for centuries by quasi contract misconceptions, the law of unjust enrichment entered the modern law in the 20th  C through the seminal judgements of Lord Wright in Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Coombe Barbour Ltd,  and related cases and through the strong judicial and juristic following they inspired.  That &#147;&#133;any civilised system of law is bound to provide remedies for &#133; unjust enrichment&#133;&#148;  became an imperative across the common law world: it has long held a place in the Roman Dutch jurisdictions of South Africa and Continental Europe.

The special character of unjust enrichment in Anglo/Australian law is focussed upon a unique action where-by the law imposes an obligation upon the establishment of a recognised ground.  The notion of breach of a primary rule does not arise: the obligation is therefore a primary obligation imposed by law, as distinct from a remedy for a breach.  Important consequences flow from the characteristic.

The juristic development of unjust enrichment in the common law has long been the sole prerogative of the superior courts.  The place of historical features of the jurisprudence has however been subsumed by modern judicial methodology that is slowly assuming a unifying pattern of reasoning from case to case; from one ground to another.  This is the special characteristic of the unifying legal concept and English principle of unjust enrichment.

The thesis draws widely based conclusions about concepts and principles of unjust enrichment and the actions and obligations they sponsor.  It portrays them as the substance of legal reasoning and analyses underlying theory.  to this end, it addresses counter juristic and historical arguments.  Its central conclusion are that there are sound jurisprudential arguments for actions based upon a unifying legal concept and English principle of unjust enrichment, and that the explanation of the unjust enrichment concept as the foundation of an independent branch of the common law and taxonomy is theoretically sustainable.  In this manner concepts and principles of the common law are demonstrated as critical characteristics of the common law at large.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">unjust enrichment</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060816.152421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The identity and autonomy of the indigenous community within Christianity.</field><field name="creator">Hill, Barbara Ann</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">abotiginal Australians</field><field name="subject">indigenous Australians</field><field name="subject">Christians</field><field name="subject">identity and autonomy</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060817.094156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade liberalization and income inequality: a theoretical analysis</field><field name="creator">Wu, Su</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">income distribution</field><field name="subject">deregulation</field><field name="subject">income inequality</field><field name="subject">trade liberalization</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060817.100610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational aspects of the numerical solution of SDEs.</field><field name="creator">Yannios, Nicholas</field><field name="description">In the last 30 to 40 years, many researchers have combined to build the knowledge base of theory and solution techniques that can be applied to the case of differential equations which include the effects of noise. This class of ``noisy'' differential equations is now known as stochastic differential equations (SDEs). 

Markov diffusion processes are included within the field of SDEs through the drift and diffusion components of the It&#244; form of an SDE. When these drift and diffusion components are moderately smooth functions, then the processes' transition probability densities satisfy the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation -- an ordinary partial differential equation (PDE).  Thus there is a mathematical inter-relationship that allows solutions of SDEs to be determined from the solution of a noise free differential equation which has been extensively studied since the 1920s.

The main numerical solution technique employed to solve the FPK equation is the classical Finite Element Method (FEM). The FEM is of particular importance to engineers when used to solve FPK systems that describe noisy oscillators. The FEM is a powerful tool but is limited in that it is cumbersome when applied to multidimensional systems and can lead to large and complex matrix systems with their inherent solution and storage problems.

I show in this thesis that the stochastic Taylor series (TS) based time discretisation approach to the solution of SDEs is an efficient and accurate technique that provides transition and steady state solutions to the associated FPK equation. 

The TS approach to the solution of SDEs has certain advantages over the classical techniques. These advantages include their ability to effectively tackle stiff systems, their simplicity of derivation and their ease of implementation and re-use. Unlike the FEM approach, which is difficult to apply in even only two dimensions, the simplicity of the TS approach is independant of the dimension of the system under investigation. Their main disadvantage, that of requiring a large number of simulations and the associated CPU requirements, is countered by their underlying structure which makes them perfectly suited for use on the now prevalent parallel or distributed processing systems.

In summary, l will compare the TS solution of SDEs to the solution of the associated FPK equations using the classical FEM technique. One, two and three dimensional FPK systems that describe noisy oscillators have been chosen for the analysis. As higher dimensional FPK systems are rarely mentioned in the literature, the TS approach will be extended to essentially infinite dimensional systems through the solution of stochastic PDEs.

In making these comparisons, the advantages of modern computing tools such as computer algebra systems and simulation software, when used as an adjunct to the solution of SDEs or their associated FPK equations, are demonstrated.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stochastic differential equations</field><field name="subject">stochastic processes</field><field name="subject">computer simulation</field><field name="subject">computing</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060817.123449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilising solar energy within conventional coal fired power stations.</field><field name="creator">Baziotopoulos, Con</field><field name="description">Although the thermodynamic advantages of using solar energy to replace the bled off steam in the regeneration system of Rankine cycle coal fired power stations has been proven theoretically, the practical techno/economic feasibility of the concept has yet to be confirmed relative to real power station applications.  To investigate this concept further, computer modelling software &#147;THERMSOLV&#148; was specifically developed for this project at Deakin University, together with the support of the Victorian power industry and Australian Research Council (ARC).  This newly developed software simulates the steam cycle to assess the techno/economic merit of the solar aided concept for various power station structures, locations and local electricity market conditions.  Two case studies, one in Victoria Australia and one in Yunnan Province, China, have been carried out with the software.  Chapter one of this thesis defines the aims and scope of this study.  Chapter two details the literature search in the related areas for this study.  The thermodynamic concept of solar aid power generation technology has been described in chapter three.  In addition, thermodynamic analysis i.e. exergy/availability has been described in this chapter.  The &#147;Thermosolv&#148; software developed in this study is detailed in chapter four with its structure, functions and operation manual included.  In chapter five the outcomes of two case studies using the &#147;Thermosolv&#148; software are presented, with discussions and conclusions about the study in chapters 6 and 7 respectfully.

There are presently 39 recognised Universities in Australia and between them they provide the nation with the academically qualified leaders of the future.  As such one would expect that not only would they be the vessels of our knowledge, but also that they would be managed and led in ways that were similar to those in use in the private sector.

The changes that have taken place in the higher education system have meant that additional pressures have been placed upon the senior executive of each University.  The transition from a binary system to the current unified system, the advent of the global community, increased technology and new management practices have created the need for University management to adopt recognised management and leadership practices.

The Federal government has moved to reduce the dependence of the system upon recurrent funding and there has been an increase in managerialism within Universities.  One outcome has been the need for the Chief Executive Officer (Vice-Chancellor) to develop additional management and leadership skills in order to cope with the changes occurring and the rate of change.

In the United States, the selection criteria used to recruit Vice-Chancellors (or University Presidents) have changed to reflect the desire for candidates to have backgrounds in management and leadership.  The role of the Vice-Chancellor is critical to the success of educational institutions that are now being managed as autonomous business units responsible for budget, growth, mergers as well as maintaining academic credibility.

A literature review revealed that the work undertaken by David Sloper formed virtually our entire knowledge base of Vice-Chancellors in Australia.  Sloper identified democratic and incumbency patterns, social characteristics, the legal basis for the role and what incumbents actually do.  Thus we know quite a deal about the role and incumbents.

However the same literature review showed that while this data existed, it did not extend to the processes that were used within the Higher Education system, to target, identify and select suitable candidates.  Clearly there was also no examination as to the effectiveness of such processes or how they could be improved if necessary.  Given the importance of Universities in Australia and their role in Higher Education, this lack of knowledge provided the basis for this study and the systematic review of all available data.

The study also identified a paradox in addition to the lack of research on recruitment and selection practices in this unique microcosm.  The paradox concerns the fact that many of the successful candidates do not come from a &#145;business&#146; discipline as may be expected for a role considered to be the Chief Executive Officer of the institution.

Yet in Australia, previous research indicated that the &#145;rules&#146; for recruiting Vice-Chancellors have changed little and that traditionally candidates have come from the science disciplines (Sloper, 1994).  While this in itself does not indicate that incumbents are lacking in fundamental management and leadership knowledge and expertise, an obvious question arises.  Why are Australian Vice-Chancellors not drawn from faculties where this expertise resides or why are they not drawn from the business community?

In order to further examine the processes in place and to a lesser extent the paradox, all available data was collected regarding the roles of Vice-Chancellors, the paths they have taken to the position as well as selection criteria, position outlines, job adverts and related material.  This was thoroughly examined and then a brief questionnaire was forwarded to current incumbents and other involved stakeholders.  Interviews were conducted to clarify specific issues and case studies prepared accordingly.

Thus this qualitative study thoroughly researches the recruitment and selection practices in use, attempts to determine their effectiveness and addresses the paradox in order to provide a detailed framework that allows these elements to be explained.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australians Universities</field><field name="subject">Vice-Chancellors</field><field name="subject">administrators</field><field name="subject">recruitment</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060818.101656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of yarn hairiness.</field><field name="creator">Chang, Lingli</field><field name="description">Yarn hairiness affects not only the quality of products, but also the productivity in spinning and weaving.  Too much yarn hairiness is undesirable for many end uses as well as the spinning and post spinning processes.  The main aims of this project are to examine the hairiness features of various yarns and to reduce yarn hairiness.  The thesis covers five related areas &#150; hairiness assessment, factors affecting yarn hairiness, the hairiness of newly developed yarns, yarn hairiness reduction, and effect of yarn hairiness on the energy consumption in ring spinning.

The worsted cashmere, pure wool and wool/cashmere blend yarns were employed to investigate the effect of some fibre parameters on the yarn hairiness.  A single exponential distribution of the hair-length was confirmed first, using the data from the Zweigle G565 Hairiness Meter.  A linear relationship was observed between the blend ratio and the hairiness indexes.  In particular, the effect of fibre crimp or curvature on yarn hairiness is examined.  The theory of yarn hairiness composition was also developed further.

The effect of draft ratio and spindle speed on the hairiness of worsted wool yarn was examined next with a factorial experiment design.  Several new hairiness indexes, namely the relative hairiness indexes, have been used to explain the results obtained.

In the  investigation of the hairiness of newly developed yarns, the hairiness of the Compact Spun and Roller-Jet-Spun yarns was examined first.  The composition of the yarn hairiness, the hair-length distribution, and the effect of test speed on yarn hairiness were then studied.  An important finding is that for both yarns, the predominant hairiness feature is the looped hairs.

A comparison of the hairiness of Solospun yarns and the equivalent ring spun wool yarns was undertaken.  The hair-length distribution of the Solospun yarn was examined first.  The Solospun yarns used had fewer hairs in most hair-length groups and lower variations in hairiness.  In addition, the effect of twist level and spindle speed on the hairiness of Solospun and conventional ring spun yarns has also been discussed.

A novel approach of reducing yarn hairiness &#150; spinning with a &#145;Diagonal&#146; yarn path was examined next.  Both &#145;Left Diagonal&#146; and &#145;Right Diagonal&#146; yarn arrangements were studied.  A new finding is that the &#145;Right Diagonal&#146; yarn path leads to reduced hairiness for the Z-twist yarn, while yarn evenness and tenacity are not as sensitive to the modified yarn path.  The mechanism of hairiness reduction with the &#145;Diagonal&#146; yarn path has been discussed.  The spinning performance of &#147;Right Diagonal&#148; yarn arrangement has also been evaluated.

Finally, the effect of yarn hairiness on the energy consumption in ring spinning has been investigated theoretically and experimentally.  A theoretical model has been developed, which represents the first attempt at theoretically investigating the influence of yarn hairiness on energy consumption during the winding stage of ring spinning.  The experimental results have generally confirmed predictions of this model.  Recommendations for further research in this area have also been made in the concluding chapter of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">yarn hairiness</field><field name="subject">yarn testing</field><field name="subject">spinning</field><field name="subject">yarn</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060823.141926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The revelationary art of Joyce Lorraine Sullivan :An artist's experience of her inner dimensions, an inner journey of discovery</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Joyce Lorraine</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Joyce Lorraine Sullivan</field><field name="subject">Painting</field><field name="subject">spirituality in art</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">australian art</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060825.113351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women, religion and social change in the Philippines: Refractions of the past in urban filipinas' religious practices today.</field><field name="creator">Drum, Mary Therese</field><field name="description">This research is an exploration of the place of religious beliefs and practices in the life of contemporary, predominantly Catholic, Filipinas in a large Quezon City Barangay in Metro Manila.   I use an iterative discussion of the present in the light of historical studies, which point to women in pre-Spanish &#145;Filipino&#146; society having been the custodians of a rich religious heritage and the central performers in a great variety of ritual activities.    I contend that although the widespread Catholic evangelisation, which accompanied colonisation, privileged male religious leadership, Filipinos have retained their belief in feminine personages being primary conduits of access to spiritual agency through which the course of life is directed.   In continuity with pre-Hispanic practices, religious activities continue to be conceived in popular consciousness as predominantly women&#146;s sphere of work in the Philippines.   I argue that the reason for this is that power is not conceived as a unitary, undifferentiated entity.   There are gendered avenues to prestige and power in the Philippines, one of which directly concerns religious leadership and authority.   The legitimacy of religious leadership in the Philippines is heavily dependent on the ability to foster and maintain harmonious social relations.   At the local level, this leadership role is largely vested in mature influential women, who are the primary arbiters of social values in their local communities.   I hold that Filipinos have appropriated symbols of Catholicism in ways that allow for a continuation and strengthening of their basic indigenous beliefs so that Filipinos&#146; religious beliefs and practices are not dichotomous, as has sometimes been argued.   Rather, I illustrate from my research that present day urban Filipinos engage in a blend of formal and informal religious practices and that in the rituals associated with both of these forms of religious practice, women exercise important and influential roles.   From the position of a feminist perspective I draw on individual women&#146;s articulation of their life stories, combined with my observation and participation in the religious practices of Catholic women from different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds, to discuss the role of Filipinas in local level community religious leadership.   I make interconnections between women&#146;s influence in this sphere, their positioning in family social relations, their role in the celebration of All Saints and All Souls Days in Metro Manila&#146;s cemeteries and the ubiquity and importance of Marian devotions.   I accompany these discussions with an extensive body of pictorial plates.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">social life</field><field name="subject">customs</field><field name="subject">social conditions</field><field name="subject">women in the philippines</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">religious life</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060825.115435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Our ground : A study of artmaking and landscape in Mildura</field><field name="creator">Beyer, Anjelie</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">painters</field><field name="subject">painting</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">artists</field><field name="subject">Mildura</field><field name="subject">artmaking</field><field name="subject">landscape art</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060831.115529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental site assessment for abalone ranching on artificial reef</field><field name="creator">James, Darren Stuart</field><field name="description">This study investigated the feasibility of ranching the abalone Haliotis rubra (Leach) and Haliotis laevigata (Donovan) on concrete artificial reefs at a site chosen by industry investors on silty bottom off Altona Beach, Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia.  The study started from the premise that artificial reef deployment combined with abalone stock enhancement may achieve the dual purpose of habitat and stock improvement.  It evaluated the hydrodynamics of the site in relation to artificial reef structural stability and drift algal transport, the development and ecology of the artificial reef assemblage, and abalone enhancement by seeding the reefs with hatchery juvenile abalone and transplanting adult broodstock abalone. 
Despite a scarcity of reports on culturing abalone on artificial reef, a literature review examined broadly the functions of artificial reefs, particularly in the context of abalone enhancement, and the relationship between artificial reefs, hydrodynamics and ecology.  The major finding was that the success of artificial reef projects is highly dependent on the environment of the chosen site, and that preliminary studies are essential to predict their likely success. This consideration alone provided strong justification to undertake this study.  
The topography at the Altona site was generally flat, with natural patches of low basalt boulder reef, offering low habitat complexity, yet supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna, including a low-density  wild  stock  of H. rubra.   Water  depth was a mean of 3.3 m at low tide and 4.4 m at high tide. 
A single, uncomplicated, concrete artificial reef of H-shape design, was tested as abalone habitat.
The  hydrodynamic analysis  confirmed previous  studies of  Port Phillip Bay, with mild current speeds 
of mean 0.045 m.s-1, and maximum-modelled wave height (H1/3) of 1.21 m and period (T1/3) of 4.51 sec. Water temperature ranged from 9.9&#186;C during July to 23.8&#186;C during January, with salinity averaging of 35.5 ppt.  The site had a low probability of receiving drift algae, necessary as a food source for abalone, because of its geographic location, potentially affecting ranch productivity.
Ecological monitoring of the three-year old artificial reef shows complex changes in the flora and fauna over time, particularly in respect of the sessile fauna.  Key differences between the artificial reef and a nearby natural reef community were: lower cover of corallines and late colonisers, such as sponges.  High levels of sedimentation were recorded at the Altona site. 
Hatchery juvenile H. laevigata, with mean survival of 15% after two years and a mean annual growth rate of 39 mm, showed the most promise for outplanting.  In comparison, for hatchery juvenile H. rubra, mean survival was 9% after three years and mean annual growth rate was 22 mm.  No natural recruitment of H. laevigata was recorded on artificial reef despite transplants of adult broodstock on the reefs.  Natural recruitment of H. rubra was also low and insufficient to reliably contribute to abalone ranch stock. 
Having examined the hydrodynamic, ecological and enhancement attributes of the Altona site, the study concluded that the site was marginally viable for abalone ranching, and that an alternative site near Werribee, 20 km further southwest, had superior attributes for growth and survival of abalone.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">abalone</field><field name="subject">abalone culture</field><field name="subject">reefs</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Port Phillip Bay</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060914.100744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Victorianisms in twentieth century young adult fiction</field><field name="creator">Hodge, Diana Victoria</field><field name="description">Abstract:
This thesis investigates the origins of contemporary fictional constructions of childhood by examining the extent to which current literary representations of children and childhood have departed from their Victorian origins.  I set out to test my intuition that many contemporary young adult novels perpetuate Victorian ideals and values in their constructions of childhood, despite the overt circumstantial modernity of the childhoods they represent. The question this thesis hopes to answer therefore is, how Victorian is contemporary young adult fiction?

To gauge the degree of change that has taken place since the Victorian period, differences and points of continuity between representations of nineteenth century childhood and twentieth century childhood will be sought and examined in texts from both eras. The five aspects of fictional representation that I focus on are: notions of innocence; sexuality; the child as saviour; the use of discipline and punishment to create the ideal child; and the depiction of childhood and adulthood as separate worlds.

The primary theoretical framework used derives from Michel Foucault&#146;s concepts of the construction of subjectivity through discourse, discipline and punishment, and his treatment of repression and power, drawn mainly from The History of Sexuality vol. 1 (1976) and Discipline and Punish; the Birth of the Prison (1977). I have chosen to use Foucault primarily because of the affinity between his work on the social construction of knowledge and the argument that childhood is a constructed rather than essential category; and because Foucault&#146;s work on Victorian sexuality exposes links with current thinking rather than perpetuating assumptions about sexual repression in this period.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Victorian</field><field name="subject">young adult fiction</field><field name="subject">children's literature</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060525.151043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rethinking a learning environment strategy</field><field name="creator">Calway, Bruce Alexander</field><field name="description">I have committed a significant period of time (in my case five years) to the purpose development of learning environments, with the belief that it would improve the self-actualisation and self-motivation of students and teachers alike. I consider it important to record and measure performance as we progressed toward such an outcome.

Education researchers and practitioners alike, in the higher (university/tertiary) education systems, are seeking among new challenges to engage students and teachers in learning (James, 2001). However, studies to date show a confusing landscape littered with a multiplicity of interpretations and terms, successes and failures. As the discipline leader of the Information Technology, Systems and Multimedia (ITSM) Discipline, Swinburne University of Technology, Lilydale, I found myself struggling with this paradigm. I also found myself being torn between what presents as pragmatic student learning behaviour and the learner-centred  teaching ideal reflected in the Swinburne Lilydale mission statement. 

The research reported in this folio reflects my theory and practice as discipline leader of the ITSM Discipline and the resulting learning environment evolution during the period 1997/8 to 2003. The study adds to the material evidence of extant research through firstly, a meta analysis of the learning environment implemented by the ITSM Discipline as recorded in peer reviewed and published papers; and secondly, a content analysis of student learning approaches, conducted on data reported from a survey of &#145;learning skills inventory&#146; originally conducted by the ITSM Discipline staff in 2002.

In 1997 information and communication technologies (ICT) were beginning to provide plausible means for electronic distribution of learning materials on a flexible and repeatable basis, and to provide answers to the imperative of learning materials distribution relating to an ITSM Discipline new course to begin in 1998. A very short time frame of three months was available prior to teaching the course. The ITSM 
 
Discipline learning environment development was an evolutionary process I began in 1997/8 initially from the requirement to publish print-based learning guide materials for the new ITSM Discipline subjects. Learning materials and student-to-teacher reciprocal communication would then be delivered and distributed online as virtual learning guides and virtual lectures, over distance as well as maintaining classroom-based instruction design. Virtual here is used to describe the use of ICT and Internet-based approaches. No longer would it be necessary for students to attend classes simply to access lecture content, or fear missing out on vital information. 

Assumptions I made as discipline leader for the ITSM Discipline included, firstly, that learning should be an active enterprise for the students, teachers and society; secondly, that each student comes to a learning environment with different learning expectations, learning skills and learning styles; and thirdly, that the provision of a holistic learning environment would encourage students to be self-actualising  and self-motivated. Considerable reading of research and publications, as outlined in this folio, supported the update of these assumptions relative to teaching and learning. 

ITSM Discipline staff were required to quickly and naturally change their teaching styles and communication of values to engage with the emergent ITSM Discipline learning environment and pedagogy, and each new teaching situation. From a student perspective such assumptions meant students needed to move from reliance upon teaching and prescriptive transmission of information to a self-motivated and more self-actualising and reflective set of strategies for learning. 

In constructing this folio, after the introductory chaperts, there are two distinct component parts;

&#149;	firstly, a Descriptive Meta analysis (Chapter Three) that draws together several of my peer reviewed professional writings and observations that document the progression of the ITSM Discipline learning environment evolution during the period 1997/8 to 2003. As the learning environment designer and discipline leader, my observations and published papers provide insight into the considerations that are required when providing an active, flexible and multi-modal learning environment for students and teachers; and

&#149;	secondly, a Dissertation (Chapter Four), as a content analysis of a learning skills inventory data collection, collected by the ITSM Discipline in the 2002 Swinburne Lilydale academic year, where students were encouraged to complete reflective journal entries via the ITSM Discipline virtual learning guide subject web-site. That data collection included all students in a majority of subjects supported by the ITSM Discipline for both semesters one and two 2002. The original purpose of the journal entries was to have students reflectively involved in assessing their learning skills and approaches to learning. Such perceptions were tested using a well-known metric, the &#145;learning skills inventory&#146; (Knowles, 1975), augmented with a short reflective learning approach narrative. The journal entries were used by teaching staff originally and then made available to researchers as a desensitised data in 2003 for statistical and content analysis relative to student learning skills and approaches.

The findings of my research support a view of the student and teacher enculturation  as utilitarian,  dependent and pragmatically self-motivated. This, I argue, shows little sign of abatement in the early part of the 21st Century. My observation suggests that this is also independent of the pedagogical and educational philosophy debate or practice as currently presented. As much as the self-actualising, self-motivated learning environment can be justified philosophically, the findings observed from this research, reported in this 
folio, cannot. Part of the reason for this originates from the debate by educational 
 
researchers as to the relative merits of liberal and vocational philosophies for education combined with the recent introduction of information and communication technologies, and commodification of higher education.

Challenging students to be participative and active learners, as proposed by educationalists Meyers and Jones (1993), i.e. self-motivated and self-actualising learners, has proved to be problematic. This, I will argue, will require a change to a variable/s (not yet identified) of higher education enculturation on multiple fronts, by students, teachers and society in order to bridge the gap. This research indicates that tertiary educators and educational researchers should stop thinking simplistically of constructivist and/or technology-enabled approaches, students learning choices and teachers teaching choices. Based on my research I argue for a far more holistic set of explanations of student and staff expectations and behaviour, and therefore pedagogy that supports those expectations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">college teaching</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">active learning</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">education educational technology</field><field name="subject">internet in education</field><field name="subject">compter-assisted instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060914.151947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performing masculinity and leadership: Male academics' work practices and identities</field><field name="creator">Keamy, Ron Leslie</field><field name="description">In this thesis, a folio comprising a major dissertation and three elective tasks, issues including masculinity(ies), identities, leadership and academics&#146; work practices are considered against a backdrop of change in the higher education sector.  Narrative research methods are applied throughout the folio.

The first elective, a discussion and commentary arising from an interview with an experienced practitioner in gender education, amounts to a feasibility study for the dissertation, whereas the second elective experiments with the use of computer mediated communication as a means of interviewing a small number of male academics about their inclusive teaching practices.  Primarily curiosity-driven research, the conclusion is drawn that computer mediated communication, if used at all, ought provide a complementary, not primary means of data collection.  The third elective conveys the life story of an Asian-Australian academic who expresses different masculinities according to the social settings in which he finds himself.  The conclusion is made that there is neither a single colored masculinity nor a single working class masculinity.  The milieux of race and class need to be considered together.

The research described in the major dissertation was undertaken with a group of eleven male academics from a number of rural and metropolitan universities &#150; men who were thought by their colleagues and peers to practice collaborative approaches to leadership.  Whereas the majority of the men practised what could be described as transformational approaches to leadership, a small number exploited the process of collaboration mainly for their own protection.  Very few of the men engaged in discourses of gender.  One of the principal conclusions reached in the paper is that there are ramifications for future leadership training that universities offer so that it becomes more relevant and socially inclusive.  Another main conclusion relates to the intimidation reported by some of the men in the study, and that there are implications for universities in the way they protect their employees from such incidents.  A third significant conclusion is that there is some way to go before gender is integrated into the discourse of male academics.  Until this can occur, limited opportunities exist for alliances to be formed between most male academics and feminist academics for the advancement of socially just workplaces.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">college teaching</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">sex differences in education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060915.115203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of phosphite as a control for Phytophthora cinnamomi in southeastern Victorian vegetation communities</field><field name="creator">Aberton, Michael J.</field><field name="description">One of the major aims of the research presented in this thesis was to assist managers of native vegetation communities in southeastern Australia in understanding the dynamics of P. cinnamomi with an important ecological species, Xanthorrhoea australis.  It trialed the use of phosphite in large-scale field applications to establish the usefulness of this management option for the first time on Victorian flora.
This thesis describes the process of disease development within mature X. Australia plants.  For the first time it was shown that within X. australis plants, secondary disease symptoms are related to the percentage of stem that has been infested by the disease.  It was evident that after initial invasion the pathogen moves via root xylem and throughout the plant within vascular to the stem, especially within the desmium.  The research shows that the pathogen could not be isolated consistently even though it was considered to be responsible for disease symptoms.
Trials of a control fungicide (Foli-R-fos 200) shows that protection occurs in many susceptible plants when 2 and 6g a.i./L phosphite is applied.  Phytotoxicity occurred in native plants at Anglesea and within controlled environment trials when using &#8805; 6g a.i./L.  It will be shown that 2g a.i./L phosphite controls disease in sprayed plots within heathlands at Anglesea and a recently burnt coastal woodland community at Wilson&#146;s Promontory.  The proportion of healthy X. australis plants treated with phosphite was significantly higher than the proportion in control plots without phosphite.  The research shows that phosphite was recovered from leaves of three species treated with Foli-R-fos 200 in the field.  For the first time it has been shown that seed germination was reduced in two species when high concentrations of phosphite were applied.  The first documentation of the effect that phosphite has on soil properties showed that nitrogen and oxidised organic carbon were the only parameters to alter significantly.
This thesis provides answers to some important questions, answers that can now be used by managers in formulating better policies and actions at an operational level.  There has been a dire need in Victoria to address many issues regarding P. cinnamomi and this thesis provides relevant and informative approaches to disease control, and a better understanding of the disease progress.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="subject">Xanthorrhoea</field><field name="subject">pathogenic microorganisms</field><field name="subject">fungicides</field><field name="subject">phosphite</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060921.150649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of relationships between colonial women and black Australians.</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Pamela Agnes</field><field name="description">The study is concerned with the history of black and white women in Australia during the colonial period.  Particular emphasis is on the variety of cross-cultural relationships which developed between women during that time.

As a starting point, male frontier violence is discussed and compared with the more moderate approach taken by women faced with threatening situations.  Among Europeans, women are revealed as being generally less racist than men.  This was a significant factor in their ability to forge bonds with black women and occasionally with black men.

The way in which contacts with Aborigines were made is explored and the impact of them on the women concerned is assessed, as far as possible from both points of view.  Until now, these experiences have been omitted from colonial history, yet I believe they were an important element in racial relations.  It will be seen that some of these associations were warm, friendly and satisfying to both sides, and often included a good deal of mutual assistance.  Others involved degrees of exploitation.  Both are examined in detail, using a variety of sources which include the works of modern Aboriginal writers.

This study presents a new aspect of the female experiences which was neglected until the emergence of the feminist historians in the 1960&#146;s.  It properly places women, both black and white, within Australian colonial history.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women pioneers</field><field name="subject">aboriginal australians</field><field name="subject">rural conditions</field><field name="subject">social conditions</field><field name="subject">racism</field><field name="subject">women's relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060922.083240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abscisic acid regulation of plant defence responses during pathogen attack</field><field name="creator">Mohr, Peter G</field><field name="description">The plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), has previously been shown to have an impact on the resistance or susceptibility of plants to pathogens.  In this thesis, it was shown that ABA had a regulatory effect on an extensive array of plant defence responses in three different plant and pathogen interaction combinations as well as following the application of an abiotic elicitor.  In unique studies using ABA deficient mutants of Arabidopsis, exogenous ABA addition or ABA biosynthesis inhibitor application and simulated drought stress, ABA was shown to have a profound effect on the outcome of interactions between plants and pathogens of differing lifestyles and from different kingdoms.  The systems used included a model plant and an important agricultural species: Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and Peronospora parasitica  (a biotrophic Oomycete pathogen),  Arabidopsis and Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato (a biotrophic bacterial pathogen) and an unrelated plant species, soybean (Glycine max) and Phytophthora sojae (a hemibiotrophic Oomycete pathogen),  Generally, a higher than basal endogenous ABA concentration within plant tissues at the time of avirulent pathogen inoculation, caused an interaction shift towards what phenotypically resembled susceptibility.   Conversely, a lower than basal endogenous ABA concentration in plants inoculated with a virulent pathogen caused a shift towards resistance.  An extensive suppressive effect of ABA on  defence responses was revealed by a range of techniques that included histochemical, biochemical and molecular approaches.  A universal effect of ABA on suppression or induction of the phenylpropanoid pathway via regulation of the key entry point gene, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), when stimulated by biotic or abiotic elicitors was shown.  ABA also influenced a wide variety of other defence-related components such as: the development of a hypersensitive response (HR), the accumulation of the reactive oxyden species, hydrogen peroxide and the cell wall strengthening compounds lignin and callose, accumulation of SA and the phytoalexin, glyceollin and the transcription of the SA-dependent pathogenesis- related gene (PR-1).  The near genome-wide microarray gene expression analysis of an ABA induced susceptible interaction also revealed an yet unprecedented insight into the great diversity of defence responses that were influenced by ABA that included: disease resistance like proteins, antimicrobial proteins as well as phenylpropanoid and tryptophan pathway enzymes.  Subtle differences were found in the number and type of  defence responses that were regulated by ABA in each type of plant and pathogen interaction that was studied.  This thesis has clearly identified in plant/pathogen interactions previously unknown and important roles for ABA in the regulation of many defence responses.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Abscisic acid</field><field name="subject">Plant regulators</field><field name="subject">Plant defenses</field><field name="subject">pathogen attack</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060927.120049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language, power and ruling relations in vocational education and training</field><field name="creator">Grace, Lauri Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis uses institutional ethnography to explore the text-based regulatory framework of the Australian Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector. Training Packages are national competency standards used to assess local workplace practice. The Australian Quality Training Framework (AQTF) is a national compliance framework used to audit local learning and assessment practice. These texts operate in a &#145;symbiotic relationship&#146; to achieve a policy goal of national consistency. 
The researcher explicates the social relations of VET starting from her disquiet as a practitioner. The thesis argues that Training Packages and the AQTF socially organise the content and delivery of local learning and assessment activities. VET practitioners struggle to use these texts to support good practice, and their hidden work maintains an unstable VET system. Yet the extralocal mode of ruling offers no room to challenge VET policy. 
The thesis explicates three themes. Interview data is used to explore the contrast between the institutional language of Training Packages and the vernacular of workplaces in which these texts are activated. Many practitioners and participants simply do not understand Training Package competency standards. Using these texts to judge employee performance shifts the policing of workplace practice from local sites to external VET authorities. 
A second theme emerges as the analysis explores why VET practitioners use this excluding language in their work with participants. Interview data reveals that local training organisations achieve different readings as they engage with ruling VET texts. Some organisations use the national texts as broad frameworks, allowing practitioners to create spaces for meaningful learning. Other organisations adopt a narrow and rule-bound reading of national texts, displacing practitioners&#146; authority over their own practice.
A third theme is explored through examination of a sequence of VET texts. The review and redevelopment of the mandatory qualifications for VET practitioners identified the language of the competency standards as a significant accessibility issue. These concerns were reshaped and subsumed in an official response that established the use of this language as a compulsory assessable requirement and a language and literacy benchmark. 
The thesis presents a new understanding of VET as a regulatory framework established through multiple levels of ruling texts that connect local sites to national government agendas. While some individual practitioners are able to navigate through this system, there is an urgent need for practitioners as a profession to challenge national hegemony.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian National Training Authority</field><field name="subject">ANTA</field><field name="subject">Education and training services industry</field><field name="subject">Vocational education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20060927.134645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Instructional strategies integrating cognitive style construct: A meta-knowledge processing model</field><field name="creator">McKay, Elspeth</field><field name="description">The overarching goal of this dissertation was to evaluate the contextual components of instructional strategies for the acquisition of complex programming concepts.  A meta-knowledge processing model is proposed, on the basis of the research findings, thereby facilitating the selection of media treatment for electronic courseware.  When implemented, this model extends the work of Smith (1998), as a front-end methodology, for his glass-box interpreter called Bradman, for teaching novice programmers.
Technology now provides the means to produce individualized instructional packages with relative ease.  Multimedia and Web courseware development accentuate a highly graphical (or visual) approach to instructional formats.  Typically, little consideration is given to the effectiveness of screen-based visual stimuli, and curiously, students are expected to be visually literate, despite the complexity of human-computer interaction. 
Visual literacy is much harder for some people to acquire than for others!  (see Chapter Four: Conditions-of-the-Learner)
An innovative research programme was devised to investigate the interactive effect of instructional strategies, enhanced with text-plus-textual metaphors or text-plus-graphical metaphors, and cognitive style, on the acquisition of a special category of abstract (process) programming concept.  This type of concept was chosen to focus on the role of analogic knowledge involved in computer programming.  The results are discussed within the context of the internal/external exchange process, drawing on Ritchey's (1980) concepts of within-item and between-item encoding elaborations.
The methodology developed for the doctoral project integrates earlier research knowledge in a novel, interdisciplinary, conceptual framework, including: from instructional science in the USA, for the concept learning models; British cognitive psychology and human memory research, for defining the cognitive style construct; and Australian educational research, to provide the measurement tools for instructional outcomes.  


The experimental design consisted of a screening test to determine cognitive style, a pretest to determine prior domain knowledge in abstract programming knowledge elements, the instruction period, and a post-test to measure improved performance.
This research design provides a three-level discovery process to articulate:
1)	the fusion of strategic knowledge required by the novice learner for dealing with contexts within instructional strategies
2)	acquisition of knowledge using measurable instructional outcome and learner characteristics
3)	knowledge of the innate environmental factors which influence the instructional outcomes
This research has successfully identified the interactive effect of instructional strategy, within an individual's cognitive style construct, in their acquisition of complex programming concepts.  However, the significance of the three-level discovery process lies in the scope of the methodology to inform the design of a meta-knowledge processing model for instructional science. 
Firstly, the British cognitive style testing procedure, is a low cost, user friendly, computer application that effectively measures an individual's position on the two cognitive style continua (Riding &amp; Cheema,1991).  
Secondly, the QUEST Interactive Test Analysis System (Izard,1995), allows for a probabilistic determination of an individual's knowledge level, relative to other participants, and relative to test-item difficulties.  Test-items can be related to skill levels, and consequently, can be used by instructional scientists to measure knowledge acquisition.  
Finally, an Effect Size Analysis (Cohen,1977) allows for a direct comparison between treatment groups, giving a statistical measurement of how large an effect the independent variables have on the dependent outcomes.  Combined with QUEST's hierarchical positioning of participants, this tool can assist in identifying preferred learning conditions for the evaluation of treatment groups.

By combining these three assessment analysis tools into instructional research, a computerized learning shell, customised for individuals' cognitive constructs can be created (McKay &amp; Garner,1999).  
While this approach has widespread application, individual researchers/trainers would nonetheless, need to validate with an extensive pilot study programme (McKay,1999a; McKay,1999b), the interactive effects within their specific learning domain.  Furthermore, the instructional material does not need to be limited to a textual/graphical comparison, but could be applied to any two or more instructional treatments of any kind.  For instance: a structured versus exploratory strategy.  The possibilities and combinations are believed to be endless, provided the focus is maintained on linking of the front-end identification of cognitive style with an improved performance outcome.
My in-depth analysis provides a better understanding of the interactive effects of the cognitive style construct and instructional format on the acquisition of abstract concepts, involving spatial relations and logical reasoning.
In providing the basis for a meta-knowledge processing model, this research is expected to be of interest to educators, cognitive psychologists, communications engineers and computer scientists specialising in computer-human interactions.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual learning</field><field name="subject">cognitive learning</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">instructional systems</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">computer assisted instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061011.122556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invertebrate larval dynamics in seasonally closed estuaries</field><field name="creator">Arundel, Helen Patricia</field><field name="description">Estuarine benthic assemblages are often numerically dominated by polychaetes.  The limits of these populations are determined by larval, and probably to a lesser extent adult movement.  A previous study (Newton 1996), indicated that planktonic polychaete larvae were very abundant over the summer months in the Hopkins River; however, the identification and source of these larvae was not known.  Defining the extent of a population, and therefore the likelihood of that population recovering following a perturbation, is crucial for effective estuarine management.

This study investigated both the likely source of the larvae, (i.e. estuarine or marine) and the extent of larval dispersal within and between estuaries by addressing the following questions: Which taxa produced the planktonic larvae?  Are these taxa resident estuarine species? Are the larvae of different taxa evenly distributed within the estuary or do physicochemical parameters or other factors influence their abundance?  Are the same larvae found in other estuaries along the coast?  and Is there exchange of these larval taxa with the marine environment and other estuaries?

Larvae were identified and described by culturing commonly occurring planktonic larvae until adult characteristics appeared.  The spionids, Carazziella victoriensis and Prionospio Tatura, numerically dominated the plankton in the Hopkins and the spionid, Orthoprionospio cirriformia was recorded from the Hopkins, Curdies and Gellibrand estuaries.  Two spionids, Carazziella sp. and Polydora sp. were identified from tidal waters.

Mouth status and physicochemical conditions (salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen) were monitored in each estuary.  Whereas the Merri and Gellibrand estuaries were predominantly stratified over the sampling period, the Curdies was more often well mixed and the Hopkins varied from well mixed to stratified.  The duration of mouth opening and hence the opportunity for larval exchange also varied in each estuary.  The Merri River was closed for 13.5% of days over the study period, the Gellibrand River for 18.4%, the Hopkins River for 49% and the Curdies River for 71.0%.

The distributions of larvae at spatial scales of metres, 100s of metres and kilometres were investigated within a single estuary.  While the same larvae, C. victoriensis, P. Tatura and bivalve larvae, were found along the length of the Hopkins estuary the abundances varied at different spatial scales suggesting different processes were influencing the distribution of P. Tatura larvae, and C. victoriensis and bivalve larvae.

The distribution of larvae between several estuaries was investigated by monitoring meroplankton at two sites at the mouth of each of the four estuaries approximately monthly (except for winter months).  Different meroplanktonic assemblages were found to distinguish each estuary.  Further, C. victoriensis and P. Tatura larvae were only recorded in the Hopkins but larvae of the spionid, Orthoprionopio cirriformia were detected in the Hopkins, Curdies and Gellibrand estuaries.

The extent of larval exchange with other estuaries and the marine environment was determined by monitoring tidal waters.  Settlement trays were also deployed to determine if larvae were moving into estuaries and settling but not recruiting. P. 
tatura larvae were not detected in the tidal waters of any estuary and while C. victoriensis and O. cirriformia were found in both flood and ebb tides there was no evidence of movement of theses taxa to other estuaries.  Larvae of the spionids, Carazziella sp. and Polydora sp., were found in tidal waters of each estuary but were rarely detected in the plankton within the estuaries.  Neither species was found as an adult in background cores from any estuary, nor with the exception of a few individuals in the Merri, were they detected in settlement trays in any estuary.

I conclude that the source of the larvae of C. victoriensis, P. Tatura and O. cirriformia is estuarine and while C. victoriensis, and O. cirriformia move in and outh of the source estuary in tidal waters there was no evidence for movement to other estuaries.  The spionids, Carazziella sp. and Polydora sp were considered to be marine and 
while they moved in and out of estuaries in tidal waters they did not usually settle in the estuaries.

The results of this study are a crucial first step in the development of ecological models to better understand dispersal in seasonally closed estuaries that are typical of southern Australia.  This study emphasises the unique physicochemical characteristics and biological assemblages within these estuaries and the need for estuarine management to reflect these differences.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estuarine ecology</field><field name="subject">aquatic invertebrates</field><field name="subject">Gellibrand river</field><field name="subject">Merri River</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061011.142951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Androgen metabolism in the Australian lizard Tiliqua Rugosa.</field><field name="creator">Huf, Peter A</field><field name="description">Nonmammalian vertebrates possess some unusual features in their hormonal systems/ when compared to mammals. As a consequence, they can make an important contribution in investigations concerning the fundamental mechanisms operating in endocrinology. Such studies concerning androgens include inter alia their effects on developmental aspects in the brain of birds and related singing behaviour; the role of neural enzymes in reproductive processes in fish; and the relation between androgens and the stages of spermatogenesis in amphibia, The present thesis examines the biochemistry of androgens in the Australian lizard Tiliqua rugosa. The major compounds studied were testosterone and epitestosterone, which are known to be present in high concentrations in the plasma of the male animal. Previous investigations are expanded, particularly in the areas of steroid identification and testicular biosynthesis. In addition, preliminary studies on the metabolism in the brain (and other tissues) and plasma protein binding are reported.
The presence of epitestosterone as a major free androgen in the plasma of the male lizard was confirmed. Other steroids were found in the sulphate fraction. Testosterone sulphate was the most rigorously identified compound, while some evidence was also found for the presence of conjugated 5-androstene-3&#946;,17-diols, etiocholanolone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA). Epitestosterone does not appear to be extensively conjugated in this animal. Steroids were not found to be conjugated as glucuronides. The identification studies employed a novel method of electrochemical detection of steroids. This technique was investigated and extended in the current thesis.
Biosynthetic studies were carried out on androgen interconversions in the testis, in vitro. The major enzyme activities detected were 17&#945;-arid 17&#946;-oxidoreductases (17&#945;-OR and l7&#946;-OR) and 3&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3&#946;-HSD)/isonerase. No evidence was found for the presence of a steroid-17-epimerase that would directly interconvert testosterone and epitestosterone. The 17-oxidoreductases were found to be dependent on the cofactor NBDFH. Testosterone appears to be formed mainly via the 4-ene pathway, whereas epitestosterone is formed from both the 4- and 5-ene routes. The compound 5-androstene-3&#946;, 17&#945;-diol
was found to be an intermediate in the synthesis of epitestosterone from DHA. Temperature was found to significantly affect 17&#945;-OR
activity (maximum at 32&#176;C). In contrast,17&#946;-OR activity was independent of this factor in the testis. Androgen metabolism in the testis was found to be regulated by cofactors, temperature and season.
The major enzyme activities found in the male brain were 17&#945;- and 17&#946;-OR. 3&#946;HSD/isomerase was not found; however a low activity of 5&#945;-reductase was identified. Aromatase activity was not positively identified, but preliminary results suggest that it may be present at low levels. The 17-oxidoreductases were widespread throughout the brain. The 17&#945;-OR was significantly lower in the forebrain than other brain sections. The 170-OR activity did not vary significantly throughout the organ, although there was a trend for its activity to be higher in the midbrain region (containing the hypothalamus in these sections). The concentration of endogenous steroids in brain tissue was estimated by radioimmunoassay. Epitestosterone was found throughout the organ structure, whereas testosterone was found mainly in the midbrain (containing hypothalamic regions in these sections). Correlations between enzyme activities and steroid concentrations in brain regions suggested that the main function of 17&#945;-OR is to produce epitestosterone, whereas the 17&#946;-OR may catalyse a more reversible reaction in vivo. Temperature was found to significantly affect both 17&#945;- and 17&#946;-OR activities in the brain. In contrast to the testis, the maximum activity of the brain enzymes occurred at 37&#176;C. The level of 17&#945;-OR activity in the male lizard (100 nmol/g tissue/h) is the highest reported for this enzyme in vertebrates. Both activities were found to be quantitatively similar in the whole brain homogenates of male and female animals, and did not vary seasonally when examined in the male.
The 17-oxidoreductases were also found in most other tissues in T.rugosa, including epididymis, adrenal, kidney and liver (but not blood). This suggests that the high activities of both 17&#945;-OR and 17&#946;-OR are dominant features of the steroid system in this animal. The formation of 11-oxygenated compounds was found in the adrenal, in addition to the formation of polar metabolites in the kidney and liver (possibly polyhydroxylated and conjugated steroids). 
A preliminary investigation into the plasma binding of androgens was carried out. The insults suggest that there are several binding sites for testosterone; one with high affinity and low capacity; the other with low affinity and high capacity. Binding experiments were carried out at 32&#176;C. At this temperature, specific binding was greater than at 25 or 37&#176;C. From the results of competition studies it was suggested that epitestosterone (with a K(i)= 3 X 10  (-6)M for testosterone binding) regulates the binding of testosterone (K(i)=10(-7)M) and hence the concentrations of the latter steroid as a free compound in plasma.
In general, the study has shown that the biochemistry of androgens in the reptile T.rugosa is largely similar to that found in other vertebrates. The major difference is a greatly increased activity of 17&#945;-OR, which causes a higher concentration of 17&#945;-compounds to be present in the tissues of this lizard. The physiological roles for epitestosterone are not yet clear. However it appears from this study that this steroid regulates testosterone concentrations in several tissues by either steroidogenic or binding mechanisms. Several major influences on this regulation include temperature, availability of cofactors and seasonal effects.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">androgens</field><field name="subject">physiological effect</field><field name="subject">steroid hormones</field><field name="subject">Tiliqua Rugosa</field><field name="subject">etabolism</field><field name="subject">skinks</field><field name="subject">Australian lizards</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051111.134448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of vitamin A deficiency on glucose uptake in the rat.</field><field name="creator">Oenzil, Fadil</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an investigation of the effects of vitamin A deficiency on gut function, The central hypothesis to be tested was that acute vitamin A deficiency affects glucose uptake from the small intestine- The hypothesis was tested using a system involving perfusion of isolated segments of the small intestine in the anaesthetized rat. The system was used to study effects on glucose uptake under steady-state conditions.
In the initial part of the study, experiments were diverted towards setting up the system for measuring steady-state uptake, and determining the relative contributions of active uptake and diffusion. Phenol red was found to be a reliable non-absorbable marker for determining net water movement. Phlorizin, generally at 1 mmol/L, was used as a competitive (reversible) inhibitor of active uptake. It is difficult however to confirm complete inhibition of active uptake by phlorizin because of the limited solubility of the inhibitor.
The kinetics of glucose uptake f ram intra-luminal maltose were found to be, in general, not significantly different from those applying to the uptake of glucose from an equivalent glucose solution. Maltase activity in the perfused gut segment was found to be sufficient to hydrolyse most of the maltose (80 per cent or more) in the solution being perfused, a much greater proportion than was absorbed. Glucose absorptive capacity, measured on an intestinal dry weight basis, was greatest in the duodenum and progressively less in the jejunum and ileum.
The rate of water uptake f ran the gut was increased by the presence of glucose in the lumen, and was linked to glucose uptake as shown by the inhibition of water uptake by phlorizin. Uptake of glucose by solvent drag was demonstrated by showing an increased rate of glucose uptake when the rate of water uptake was increased by perfusing a solution of reduced osmotic pressure. In the experiment a low intra-luminal glucose concentration was used to preclude net uptake by diffusion and active uptake was blocked with phlorizin.
 
This process was further investigated using streptozotocin-diabetic rats in which the diabetes establishes a hyperosomotic blood with hyperglycaemia. Uptake by solvent drag was more obvious in diabetic animals. A back-diffusion (exsorption) of glucose from the tissues to the lumen was also shown; the rate being proportional to plasma glucose concentration.
Vitamin A deficiency was established in weanling rats after 6-7 weeks feeding on a diet based on wheat starch, coconut oil, and casein washed with hot ethanol, together with vitamins and minerals. The vitamin A deficiency led to classic eye signs and was reversed by the addition to the diet of retinoic acid (5 g/g diet). Vitamin A deficiency decreased intestinal mucus production (dry weight) but had no detectable effect on the histology of the villous epithelium as shown under the light microscope. Using perfusion experiments it was shown that vitamin A deficiency had no significant effect on the rate of active uptake of glucose, but that deficiency increased the rate of passive uptake.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vitamin A deficiency</field><field name="subject">glucose uptake</field><field name="subject">mtabolism</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">Phlorizin</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20051110.120816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Envisioning Indochina: the spatial and social ordering and imagining of a French colony.</field><field name="creator">Biles, Annabel</field><field name="description">The emergence of Indochina in the French imagination was articulated in both representational and institutional modes. Representation involves the transmission of colonial ideals through more obtuse means; that is, through literary texts, travelogues, exhibitions, film and advertising. However, these textual sites feed from and invest in a material situation, which was the institutional arm of colonialism. Indochina was institutionally articulated in cartographic maps and surveys, in the new social spaces of cities and towns, in architectural and technological forms, through social technologies of discipline and welfare and in cultural and religious organisations. The aim of this thesis is to analyse, across a number of textual sites, the representation and institutionalisation of Otherness through the politics of space in the French colony of Indochina, Indochine in this sense becomes a spatial discourse. The French constructed a mental and physical space for Indochina by blanketing and suffocating the original cultural landscape, which in fact had to be ignored for this process to occur. What actually became manifest as a result of this projection stemmed from the French imagination.
Just as the French manipulated space, language also underwent the same process of reduction. The Vietnamese script was latinised to make it more 'useable' and &#145;accessible&#146;. Through christening the union of Indochina; initiating a comprehensive writing reform; and renaming the streets in the colonial cities, the French used language us another tool for 'making transparent'. Furthermore, the colonial powers established a communication and transport network throughout the colony in an attempt to materialise their fictive (artificial) vision of a unified French Indochinese space. The accessibility and design of these different modes of transport reflected the gendered, racial and class divisions inherent in the colonial establishment.
At the heart of representing and institutionalising Indochina was the desire to control and contain. This characterised French imperial ordering of space in the city and the rural areas. In rural areas land was divided into small parcels and alienated to individuals or worked into precise grids for the rubber plantation. In urban centres the native quarter was clearly demarcated from the European quarter which functioned as its modern, progressive Other. The rationale behind this segregation was premised on European, nineteenth century discourses of race, class, gender and hygiene. Influenced by Darwinian and neo-Lamarkian theories of race, this biological discourse identified the 'working class', 'women' and 'the native' as not only biologically but also culturally inferior. They were perceived as a potential, degenerative threat to the biological, cultural and industrial development of the nation. In the colonial context, space was thus ordered and domesticated to control the native population. Coextensively, the literature which springs from such a structure will be tainted by the same ideas, and thus the spaces it formulates within the readers mind feed on and reinforce this foundation.
Examples of gender and indigenous narratives which contest this imaginative, transparent topography are analysed throughout this thesis. They provide instances of struggle and resistance which undermine the ideal/stereotypical level of architectural and planned space and delineate an alternative insight into colonial spatial and social relations. The fictional accounts of European women and indigenous writers both challenge and reaffirm the fixity of some of these idealised colonial boundaries.
In various literary, historical, political, architectural and cinematic discourses Indochina has been und continues to be depicted as a modern city and exotic Utopia. Informed by the mood of nostalgia, exotic images of Indochina have resurfaced in contemporary French culture. France's continued desire to create, control and maintain an Indochinese space in the French public imagination reinforces the multi-layered, interconnected and persistent nature of colonial discourse.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indochina</field><field name="subject">colonization</field><field name="subject">civilization</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">colonies</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">social ordering</field><field name="subject">french colonies</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20050815.113440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tribology of lubricated nitrocarburised and titanium carbonitride surfaces</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Bo</field><field name="description">In the current work, two different coatings, nitrocarburised (CN) and titanium carbonitride (TiCN) on M2 grade high speed tool steel, were prepared by commercial diffusion and physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques, respectively.  Properties of the coating were characterised using a variety of techniques such as Glow-Discharge Optical Emission Spectrometry (GD-OES) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).  Three non-commercial, oil-based lubricants with simplified formulations were used for this study.

A tribological test was developed in which two nominally geometrically-identical crossed cylinders slide over each other under selected test conditions.  This test was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a pre-applied lubricant film and a surface coating for various conditions of sliding wear.  Engineered surface coatings can significantly improve wear resistance of the tool surface but their sliding wear performances strongly depend on the type of coating and lubricant combination used.  These coating-lubricant interactions can also have a very strong effect on the useful life of the lubricant in a tribological system.  Better performance of lubricants during the sliding wear testing was achieved hen used with the nitrocarburised (CN) coating.

To understand the nature of the interactions and their possible effects on the coating-lubricant system, several surface analysis techniques were used.  The molecular level investigation of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that oxidative degradation occurred in all used oil-based lubricants during the sliding wear test but the degradation behaviour of oil-based lubricants varied with the coating-lubricant system and the wear conditions.  The main differences in the carbonyl oxidation region of the FTIR spectra (1900-1600 cm-1) between different coating-lubricant systems may relate to the effective lifetime of the lubricant during the sliding wear test.

Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiling shows that the CN coating has the highest lubricant absorbability among the tested tool surfaces.  Diffusion of chlorine (C1), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) into the surface of subsurface of the tool suggested that strong interactions occurred between lubricant and tool surface during the sliding wear test.  The possible effects of the interactions on the performance of whole tribological system are also discussed.

The study of Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) indicated that the envelope of hydrocarbons (CmHn) of oil lubricant in the positive TOF-SIMS spectra shifted to lower mass fragment after the sliding wear testing due to the breakage of long-chain hydrocarbons to short-chain ones during the degradation of lubricant.  The shift of the mass fragment range of the hydrocarbon (CmHn) envelope caries with the type of both tool surface and lubricant, again confirming that variation in the performance of the tool-lubricant system relates to the changes in surface chemistry due to tribochemical interactions at the tool-lubricant interface under sliding wear conditions.

The sliding wear conditions resulted in changes not only in topography of the tool surface due to mechanical interactions, as outlined in Chapter 5, but also in surface chemistry due to tribochemical interactions, as discussed in Chapters 6 and 7.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tribology</field><field name="subject">Surface Technology</field><field name="subject">Titanium Carbonitride</field><field name="subject">Lubricated nitrocarburised</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061024.112959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' experiences of e-learning at school</field><field name="creator">Barty, Karin</field><field name="description">The dissertation describes the experiences of senior secondary students taking an online course for the first time to further their language education.

It demonstrates the important scientific and educational role of the public intellectual, Professor John Turner, and of the Melbourne University Botany School which he led for thirty five years.  The case study of the movement within the City of Sandringham and its successor the City of Bayside reveals how the inhabitants of an urbanised are responded to threats to the indigenous trees and wildflowers of their neighbourhood, stimulating botanists to assist them and using political means in order to achieve their conservation objectives.  The thesis draws upon a range of local archives, conservation literature and private papers.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant conservation</field><field name="subject">endemic plants</field><field name="subject">plant ecology</field><field name="subject">australian native plants</field><field name="subject">indigenous plants</field><field name="subject">melbourne</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.113857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chamber: Dance improvisation, masculine embodiment and subjectivity</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Shaun</field><field name="description">[No Abstract]</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dance</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">male dancers</field><field name="subject">dance improvisation</field><field name="subject">sex in dance</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.114658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian dental policy reform and the use of dental therapists and hygienists</field><field name="creator">Satur, Julie</field><field name="description">Oral diseases including dental caries and periodontal disease are among the most prevalent and costly diseases in Australia today.  Around 5.4% of Australia&#146;s health dollar is spent on dental services totalling around $2.6 billion, 84% of which are delivered through the private sector (AIHW 2001).  The other 16% is spent providing public sector services in varied and inadequate ways.  While disease rates among school children have declined significantly in the past 20 years the gains made among children are not flowing on to adult dentitions and our aging population will place increasing demands on an inadequate system into the future (AHMAC 2001).  Around 50% of adults do not received regular care and this has implications for widening health inequalities as the greatest burden falls on lower income groups (AIHW DSRU 2001).

The National Competition Policy agenda has initiated, Australia-wide, reviews of dental legislation applying to delivery of services by dentists, dental specialists, dental therapists and hygienists and dental technicians and prosthetists.  The review of the Victorian Dentists Act 1972, was completed first in 1999, followed by the other Australian states with Queensland, the ACT and the Northern Territory still developing legislation.  One of the objectives of the new Victorian Act is to &#145;&#133;promote access to dental care&#146;.  This study has grown out of the need to know more about how dental therapists and hygienists might be utilised to achieve this and the legislative frameworks that could enable such roles.

This study used qualitative methods to explore dental health policy making associated with strategies that may increase access to dental care using dental therapists and hygienists.  The study used a multiple case study design to critically examine the dental policy development process around the Review of the Dentists Act 1972 in Victoria; to assess legislative and regulatory dental policy reforms in other states in Australia and to conduct a comparative analysis of dental health policy as it relates to dental auxiliary practice internationally.

Data collection has involved (I) semi-structured interviews with key participants and stakeholders in the policy development processes in Victoria, interstate and overseas, and (ii) analysis of documentary data sources.  The study has taken a grounded theory approach whereby theoretical issues that emerged from the Victorian case study were further developed and challenged in the subsequent interstate and international case studies.  A component of this study has required the development of indicators in regulatory models for dental hygienists and therapists that will increase access to dental care for the community.  These indicators have been used to analyse regulation reform and the likely impacts in each setting.

Despite evidence of need, evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of dental therapists and hygienists, and the National Competition Policy agenda of increasing efficiency, the legislation reviews have mostly produces only minor changes.  Results show that almost all Australian states have regulated dental therapists and hygienists in more prescriptive ways than they do dentists.

The study has found that dental policy making is still dominated by the views of private practice dentists under elitist models that largely protect dentist authority, autonomy and sovereignty.  The influence of dentist professional dominance has meant that governments have been reluctant to make sweeping changes.  The study has demonstrated alternative models of regulation for dental therapists and hygienists, which would allow wider utilisation of their skills, more effective use of public sector funding, increased access to services and a grater focus on preventive care.  In the light of theses outcomes, there is a need to continue to advocate for changes that will increase the public health focus of oral health care.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental health</field><field name="subject">dentists</field><field name="subject">dental policy</field><field name="subject">dental public health</field><field name="subject">dental therapists</field><field name="subject">dental hygienists</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20061207.115552</field></doc></add>
